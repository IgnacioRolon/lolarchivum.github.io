How is it productive? How is it helping?\r\n\r\nHow does taking away a core component such as communication from a Multiplayer 5v5 team based game help anyone? The simple answer is it doesn&#039;t.\r\nIt actually creates more negative energy than it does positive. \r\n\r\nI enter every game with a chat ban with anger. Right off the bat. I lose 90% of my chat banned games which in turn creates more negative energy not only now but in the future knowing that because I am unable to communicate with my team I now am losing a battle which is hard enough to overcome in the first place.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to my second issue. The current ranking system...\r\n\r\nI genuinely hate the community the ranking system has created on this game. Especially that of lower elo. It truly is hell. The reason being is it simply isn&#039;t fair. It&#039;s not fair to place people into a rank purely based of the binary system of Win or Lose when there are 9 other variables for each player in the game. Yes it may come as some hard ass surprise Rito, but you heard me 9 other variables + yourself. That is not a demonstration of your skill, your knowledge or your desire to win and succeed. \r\n\r\nNow this system works in really high elos. And here&#039;s why. Once you know so much and once you reach a certain mechanical aptitude and everyone involved has the same mindset, than games become more even and players plateau in terms  of standing out above the rest. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I understand there is always going to be a better player than the next and someone will always come up with something new or do something better, but as a whole, you would agree games are more of a skill match up and teams can work much more clearly together..\r\n\r\nBut put yourself in Bronze 5 for a day and you&#039;ve suddenly got a whole different game. Some players barely know the items let alone have any mechanical skill or even any desire to learn. And it&#039;s not fair to say well, if you are good enough you will get yourself out. No. That&#039;s not how it works. It&#039;s luck pure pure luck. I strive on Macro game knowledge and awareness. For a Bronze 4 player I can pick up things just as well if not better than some high elo players. My mechanics on a very broad range of characters is also great. \r\n\r\nAnd that&#039;s just the problem. I don&#039;t even need to play well to win, I don&#039;t even need to play terrible to lose. It&#039;s just pure luck.  9 Other players all with varying levels on skill, gambling on a win or a loss. Most games are lost before I enter them purely based on picks. But it&#039;s a crime to dodge a Q apparently. We can decline them in the first place, but when the crap hits the fan it&#039;s just not acceptable to leave! \r\n\r\nI&#039;m sure your innovative minds at Rito Games can come up with a solution that&#039;s fair and benefits everyone? Hell even I have come up with more logical things. \r\n\r\nLike first and foremost implementing a Pause button. Is it too hard to trust that 10 players are not going to abuse a simple pause function that only needs to have a total limit of 5 minutes or so on it... 5 Minutes! It takes 20 to get into the Champion Select in the first place, only to enter the game to find out your loving Supports router decided that the lighting{{item:3087}}  outside was just too much to handle!\r\n\r\nSecondly, why do we create negative environments for players in lower elos? How are players supposed to get better in the first place when all they are playing with is unskilled players. Why isn&#039;t Bronze an open pool where they are introduced into Higher Elo (Not too high obviously) games and given the opportunity not only to learn but for those like me who have like 4000 games behind them the chance to show continual good performance at those levels and get promoted or advanced on to them. Kind of like Mentorships etc. You want to create a better player base after all not just chuck them all into slums and say here, fight it out! Whoever is lucky enough to get to the top get&#039;s this shiny thing! Think of it like the local kids Soccer pool. Obviously they have a share of inexperienced teams and players, the beauty behind it is they all have a chance to play against one another, regardless of skill. \r\n\r\nThirdly, why do I lose LP *what ever LP is* (Some sort of cheap fabricated currency, which is obviously and so blatantly mathematically meant to not mean crap anyways since you always seem to end on 99LP and have to get yourself that extra WIN! to be able to get into a series where you are forced to win 2 games with those 9 other variables we were talking about earlier), due to another players negative behavior or AFK or Disconnection? How is that justifiable? You could at very least half it! Think about who the hell is going to abuse that? Oh dw guys I will just get myself a 10 game 20 Min Q ban and lose all my LP so you guys only lose half! Totally worth! *sigh* Rito come on now.\r\n\r\nAnyways to cut this very long story short. Something needs to change somewhere. I don&#039;t know how to explain it all over text but I just simply cannot justify spending my time playing this game anymore not enjoying myself, where at least I can jump on CS:GO and if I get a tool on the team we can kick him and get a bot instead, another feature that&#039;s obviously too hard for Ritos masterminds to program I suppose.\r\n\r\nAnyways I think my local library is selling &quot;Game Development: For Dummies&quot; books if you are interested. Goodnight.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-11T01:44:12.459+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> How does taking away a core component such as communication from a Multiplayer 5v5 team based game help anyone? The simple answer is it doesn't.\nIt actually creates more negative energy than it does positive.\n\nLet's start with this shall we. If all or nearly all communication from a person is negativity, insults or targeted verbal abuse etc etc then what value does that communication have? Not none, rather it has negative value. It negatively impacts the experience of other players, risks tilting them as well and making them play worse. \n\nSo chat restrictions help the other players in the game first off. But in most cases it also helps the one with the restriction. Maybe this isn't the case for you, but for many, taking away the temptation of using chat to abuse others for mistakes or whatever vastly reducing their negativity, simply because they aren't engaging it.\n___\n> I enter every game with a chat ban with anger. Right off the bat. I lose 90% of my chat banned games which in turn creates more negative energy not only now but in the future knowing that because I am unable to communicate with my team I now am losing a battle which is hard enough to overcome in the first place.\n\nWhy? If you are entering a game so angry then why are you playing at all? If communication is so important to you wouldn't you be better off going into maybe some ARAMs or featured gamemodes to play the restriction out where communication is less important. But this is a game designed to be fun for ALL involved. So why are you playing if you aren't having fun? Is it to climb? What is that worth really if you don't enjoy it as well?\n\nBut on the communication note, more often than not pings are enough to communicate the really important stuff. It's not like they've taken away your ability to communicate with your team, it has simply be determined that the positive value your chat communications bring does not outweigh the negative value.\n\nIf you go into a game 1. Angry and 2. Assuming it's a loss then you aren't going to do very well at all. Attitude plays a MUCH bigger role than you think. If only that being angry/negative towards your team will distract you from your own gameplay.\n___\n> Yes it may come as some hard ass surprise Rito, but you heard me 9 other variables + yourself. That is not a demonstration of your skill, your knowledge or your desire to win and succeed.\n\nIt is not representative of your personal skill on a champion in a lane no, that is what the mastery system is. [The ranking system is representative of your ability to play as a team with that champion in that lane to get objectives and ultimately win the game.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide) League is a team game, and one distinction people often seem to overlook is that at the end of the game, KDA is irrelevant, _**it's about killing the nexus**_.\n\nAs for the matter of variables, if you don't like your odds then you have ways to improve them. \n\nIf you don't like the odds of a potato being 4/5 then make it 0. Find a premade to play with. When you play with a premade often you know how they play, you have better communication and need less communication to know what they are doing and why. You understand their playstyles and how to support them as a part of a team.\n\nIf you are determined to play solo then there is only one constant variable that you can improve, and that is yourself. No matter how shitty your teams are or how much better you are than everyone else in your elo, there is always someone better. Why does being better than your team stop YOU from improving? It doesn't. There's always something you could improve or do better, and losing a game doesn't stop that.\n\nThe attitude you need to have to climb is not \"win every game\", it's \"improve something every game\". Because by improving your own play you are increases your chances of winning and thus climbing. Wanting to just win every game is skipping a step and won't get you anywhere.\n___\n> No. That's not how it works. It's luck pure pure luck.\n\nLuck is just chance, chance is just odds. Increase your odds of winning and your 'luck' will go up.\n___\n> I strive on Macro game knowledge and awareness. For a Bronze 4 player I can pick up things just as well if not better than some high elo players. My mechanics on a very broad range of characters is also great.\n\nHaving the game knowledge is great, but there's more to it than just that. All you say is high elo, and that's pretty subjective in and of itself, but do you think you're micro, your macro, your game knowledge, your general understanding of the game is challenger tier? Then there's something you can do to improve it. Again it's all about increasing your odds.\n\nAs for broad range, is that really your best option right now? To start climbing your best bet is to get REALLY comfortable with two champion in each of your two roles. Comfort picks are better than counter picks.\n___\n> And that's just the problem. I don't even need to play well to win, I don't even need to play terrible to lose.\n\nBecause it's not about KDA, it's about killing the nexus. What I see is that your definition of playing well strays from the kind of playing well that will actually win you games.\n___\n> Most games are lost before I enter them purely based on picks.\n\nBut are they? If most people at your mmr have similarly limited game knowledge then picks/counterpicks have less impact. Being counterpicked doesnt mean anything if they don't know how to play that counterpick. Remember that in Bronze picks are less important than how well you can play them, which is why getting better at one champion is better than trying to learn many at this stage. You said it yourself, what works in high mmr does not often apply in low mmr.\n___\n> But it's a crime to dodge a Q apparently.\n\nIf you're only dodging the occasional troll or pronounced feeder then the system won't punish you with anything more than the 5 minute afk check. If you are dodging every other game because you don't agree with someone's pick, regardless if maybe they are really good with that champion then yes, you will be punished. Tactical disagreements are not condemned, they happen all the time. Try to be more accepting of unusual picks, more often than not they will actually work in your favour. (Why pick something unusual unless you can play it well?)\n___\n>  Is it too hard to trust that 10 players are not going to abuse a simple pause function that only needs to have a total limit of 5 minutes or so on it\n\nIf you can't trust your teams not to be trolling/feeding potatoes, why would you trust them with a pause function? \"Oh I'm about to die? Let me just pause and throw of their combo and their focus so I have a chance at escape\" Pauses are used in tournaments because the competitive integrity and oversight is there to regulate it. It doesn't work that way in regular ranked play.\n\nI do agree that afks could be handled better in game. The inclusion of a bot or an automatic pause or something that would help even a little. But Riot are already working on ways to lessen the frustration/disadvantage that afks/dcs bring. They reveal very quickly in their internal testing what won't work, it's not as easy as just deciding on a feature and throwing it into the game.\n___\n\n> Secondly, why do we create negative environments for players in lower elos? How are players supposed to get better in the first place when all they are playing with is unskilled players.\n\nThe negative environment is created by the players, not by Riot. The mmr for your first placements is around S3. If you end up in low Bronze it's for a reason. Maybe you played ranked too early? Maybe you f'ed up your placements last season, got placed B1 then refused to play, so next season got placed B3 (true story, and I still made it to Gold). \n\nYou have such a low view of the entirety of the \"low elo\" population and yet here you are saying there are plenty of skilled players in there who just can't get out because of teams. If most of the people in low Bronze don't deserve to be there then why aren't you giving these games a chance? \n\nBut maybe they are few and far between? Then make a premade, collect those players to increase your odds. Just know that being negative in game in chat won't do you any favours, you will just give them a very poor view of you. Personally I would take a bad player over a toxic one any day.\n___\n>  given the opportunity not only to learn...\n\nThis is precisely what normals are. If you play with dodgy mmr mixes in normals you're going to get matched with and against players with much higher mmr, and can learn from them. Near soon as I hit lvl 30 I was playing in premades with high Silvers, I learned FAST. Then I got a few friends in Plat. When you play with/against them you have to learn and adapt very quickly to keep up. \n\nSo ask on boards, find a few friends in higher mmr that are willing to play normals with you so you can learn. If your normal mmr jumps drastically then when you go back to ranked you're going to find the games much easier.\n___\n> You could at least half it! Who the hell is going to abuse that?\n\nPremades and smurfs. One person jumps on a smurf to play with someone, second the game goes bad he leaves so his mate doesn't lose as much LP. Again Riot are looking into what they can do about this, but they have to very careful, and if internal (i.e very small scale) testing is turning up big problems with something then it's never going to make it to live.\n___\n> I cannot justify playing this game anymore not enjoying myself\n\nThen why are you still playing? This is a game, it's primarily about having fun. Why are you still playing ranked if you hate it so much? Play normals, where the pressure is off and you can just enjoy and get better at the game. Or as you say, take a step back and go play something else. Playing a game you hate isn't rewarding, it's punishing.\n___\n>  I think my local library is selling \"Game Development: For Dummies\" books if you are interested.\n\nHonestly very indicative of your attitude? What does this needless negativity gain you? Nothing, it's pointless, and just paints you in a bad light.","replies":[]}]}
