The 10mr is pretty good, but the 30-50% magic resist bonus scaling with w level (which you max last) and since the core jungle tank items are Cinderhulk and Thornmail, you probably won't be getting much out of this magic resist ratio until lategame.\n\nRammus is an anti-ad answer mostly because he's strongest into the atkspeed matchup since his w reflects damage, meaning high atkspeed with low pen will often end up reflecting more damage than he takes. Mages however have low atkspeed and probably won't be autoing rammus except to proc thunderlords or whilst taunted, but they focus on their ability power builds, which tend to have early magic pen.\n\nHowever he's not designed to only work against full ad teamcomps, since that would be a simpleminded and difficult to balance, so Rammus is better into ad matchups, but not completely useless into ap heavy teamcomps.\n\nRammus is probably the most melee champion to exist, and is forced to choose between mobility or defense, since his powerball offers no resistances, and his defense curl basically makes him immobile. \n\nSince his playstyle is very linear and can't buff his defense when engaging, Rammus also sacrifices alot of what other initiator tanks are capable of in the lategame, since against a competent team, rammus will often find his hp pool being burned down before he can initiate a teamfight, compared to some more dramatic lategame teamfight tank engages such as Sejuani, Gragas, Maokai, Ammumu, Nautilus, Ornn, Zac and more, who all pack either long range initaiting tools, teamwide CC, defensive buffs that can be active before they engage with mobility, or a combination of these.\n\nRammus is a good earlygame initiator and tank, similar to Skarner, Blitzcrank, Galio, Taric, but as the game goes on they transition more towards peel oriented or secondary engage tanks with their extremely strong single target and defense CC, rather than engage and play makers.\n\nAlso while it's not technically a scaling, many tanks have %damage resist, which functions very similarly, for instance Galio's w (an anti-ap ability) increases his physical damage resist when activated based on his magic resist, which basically is an armour steroid, since armour is used to mitigate physical damage.","replies":[]}]}
