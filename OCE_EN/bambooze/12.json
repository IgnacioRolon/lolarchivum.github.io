I&#039;ve literally been sitting at my comp for 30 mins to load into a game, only to get a message in loading screen saying &quot;you have disconnected. Please return to client and try again&quot; or something along those lines. I restarted  my computer, closed client, did a full  repair of the client, and yet i disconnect in the loading screen. This was supposed to be a fun 5v5 custom game with my friends, but instead it&#039;s a 4v5 with me stuck trying to enter the game. Ever since the new update I&#039;ve had problems with the game as a whole, and I&#039;m getting sick of it already. \r\nJust someone tell me what I can do, cause right now I literally cannot play the game. \r\nThis isn&#039;t the first time this has happened either, happened earlier in the day as well, atleast after 20 mins i managed to connect in. But this time nothing&#039;s working\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s frankly fucking annoying, and I just want a solution to this shit","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-11-13T18:13:28.767+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's your potato net, not LoL.\n\nPeople always blame games for problems on their side, not server side.\nFork out a few extra dollars a month for better internet, problem solved.","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2017-11-14T00:59:44.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there supposedly anything better than NBN?
