It&#039;s kinda stupid to only allow us to see it when it is our turn to choose who we want to play. This is probably a reason why people forget to lock in, because they&#039;re too busy trying to find a champ to play. \r\n\r\nPlease Rito, bring back the Roster for the FULL duration of Champ Select.","replies":[]}
