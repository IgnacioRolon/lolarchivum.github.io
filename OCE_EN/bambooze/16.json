They get sort of glitch out, not letting me change the masteries within a page, or even being able to change a page for different champs, etc. \r\nSometimes it even glitches WHILE I&#039;m changing masteries. Just now I was trying to change my masteries for Jarvan , taking some points out of Ferocity to move to Resolve, when it just froze. I couldn&#039;t remove or add new points to the tree, or even change the page. This has happened about 3 times now, once even going into a game without a Keystone due to this freeze mid-mastery change.\r\n\r\nIf someone could explain the problem, or a Rioter to be alerted about it, I&#039;d be happy","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-11-29T11:51:25.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"like me you must be running league on a tablet pc which even though you may have the specs to handle it, the computer will limit the hardware usage of applications to ensure everything runs at once which means you won't have enough to actually run the fancy animations of the new client. \n\nMy suggestion is use the legacy client, buy a proper gaming pc or go into settings and turn off the alpha clients fancy new champ select menu animations. You're going to have to do one of those if you want the new client to run semi-smoothly during champ select.","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-11-30T00:21:15.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a mac, not tablet, which can still come with problems.
