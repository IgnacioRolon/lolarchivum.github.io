With his new q doing more damage to minions and monsters, he&#039;ll have a better time in the jungle, and the autoattack dodges will help a ton as well.\r\n\r\nI&#039;d like to know what the community thinks about these changes.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-01-19T20:09:31.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not keen at all for his changes. I'm trying not to just judge them on face value but so far i'm disappointed about everything they changed. I enjoy Shen quite a lot as he is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-19T12:32:15.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think is poke is weaker, his bursh damage is weaker, his sustain is weaker and his overall shielding potential is also weaker. The only potential benefit i see is that he will do more damage in trades his he procs his attackspeed boost and hits them 3 times\n\nHis e cd is higher.","replies":[]}]}
