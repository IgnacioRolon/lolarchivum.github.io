Have no idea why, and it;s only this new mouse I&#039;ve been having problems (it&#039;s a cheap wireless one from Ebay). Luckily this mouse comes with the DPI button, where you just press it and there are 3 settings for the sensitivity, but if anyone knows the problem and how to fix it, I&#039;d appreciate it\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}
