I&#039;d just like to say before anything that I have pretty decent internet (iinet NBN), and only very occasionally does it drop for like a second and I get a massive lag spike, or if someone in my house decides to download something at the same time -_-\r\n\r\nFirst problem I had was during a custom 2v2 with my friends and I. It was in ARAM, and I got a message at the top of my screen saying &quot;You have been disconnected from the server. Please try connecting again&quot; or something like that. I got these a lot early last season, but after a few patches I think RIot fixed it, and didn&#039;t get it again until this incident.\r\nHowever, it wasn&#039;t a huge problem, as I reconnected pretty quickly afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe second incident on the other hand, was something. It was a normal game with 4 other friends (5-man) and I was playing Lucian top (OP, trust me) and I was having a bit of lag near the beginning, but nothing game-changing. Then about 20 minutes in, I get a MASSIVE spike, and I mean massive, sky-rocketing to about 17 000 MS and I got the message saying &quot;Attempting to reconnect&quot;. Now it wouldn&#039;t stop for the rest of the game. I got around 500 ping average, drop down to 80 for like 2 seconds every once in a while and back up again. Getting the message again and again, attempting to reconnect around 7 times, give or take 2.\r\n\r\nReally wanna know from a Rioter or someone, if this is a problem with the Patch, or something personal (doubting that though)\r\n\r\nThanks, tURTL3s","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-02-14T04:24:49.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you please [download WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/download-winmtr/) and run a traceroute to the following IPs (Allow this to run for 5-15 minutes), export your results and post them here.\n\n>103.240.227.5\n103.240.227.25\n\nAlso as stated below if you're running lolreplay or anything similar, please disable this while playing as it has been known to cause issues with the game, perhaps not lag related issues but definitely crashes.","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-02-14T08:22:15.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure it's something to do with Mac, since my brothers aren't having problems (both on windows).
