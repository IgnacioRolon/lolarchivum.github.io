It&#039;s been happening for the past 2 weeks now, and it&#039;s not like the normal lag you get. Every few minutes instead of my ping just shooting up to like 1k+, it would just disconnect, and attempt to reconnect. \r\nNow I have a friend who&#039;s said that he&#039;s been getting the same kinda thing, and what i found out was that he was also with iiNet, an internet provider. So I just want to know if anyone else that&#039;s with iiNet has been having the same problems.","replies":[{"poster":"NZcebos","date":"2015-07-27T10:00:54.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From new zealand I too am experiencing high latency and unplayable lag that have never had before.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CantWinThemAll","date":"2015-07-26T07:54:16.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try turning your router off for an hour.
