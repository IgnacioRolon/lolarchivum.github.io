Scaling HP or HP Flats are so much better for your early and late game. I'm not really putting research into this but all quints go into 4.5% extra hp.\n\n the resolve mastery had the same mastery for it but removed due to the purpose of not serving its purpose for that extra tank, I think these quints are pretty much situational and should not be used most of the time unless you go like 5 warmogs Zac.","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2016-01-28T12:47:08.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing is, though, all the Quints for Tanks like Zac and Mundo are pretty situational because nothing is really any better than the other. Your other real options are Magic Pen (to benefit the % Damage on Cleaver spam and what not that a lot of Magic Damage Tanks deal), Armor, MR or % HP. I just happen to take % HP out of habit and comfort.\n\nConsidering Maokai, Zac and Mundo all heal for a % of their HP, it's a very viable Quint on them.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-01-27T16:09:20.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"do u even lyk maths br0. late game %hp is the most gold efficient rune in the game....and with games going faster and more ambient gold overall, its easier to get a higher hp value towards late game. just dont fight as much in the early game and you'll be unstoppable","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-01-27T08:39:34.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is worth it depending on the champion, and considering a lot of champs scale based off the % health you have.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-01-27T12:25:32.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For Juggernauts, I'd probably use my standard ad/ap rune page.
