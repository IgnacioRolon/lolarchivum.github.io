WHAT'S UP?\n**\nAcceptance notifications will be sent out in waves as it’s important to maintain test stability—we’ll get more players in as soon as we can.\n\n**WHAT TYPE OF PLAYERS ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?\n**\nWe want players from all over the world. Alpha access is limited to level 30 players (at least to start) with no history of negative in-game behavior. All gaming rigs are welcome, although since the client won't be perfectly optimized at the alpha’s start, players with lower-spec machines won't be prioritized early on. We'll work to get more machines in as we optimize the client.","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-08-06T01:00:41.210+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I fit the description xD","replies":[{"poster":"Shashe","date":"2016-08-09T07:01:08.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-08-05T18:55:47.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Clean record meaning no record of actually having been found guilty of a anything?
