I&#039;m not talking big obnoxious ads, but in between games on twitch where only a list of upcoming games come up, or in the bottom corner of their broadcast where the is just a blank grey square. It would obviously make them money which in turn i would assume would help them improve on the game. A competition as big as worlds has such a high viewer base, it seems like a wasted opportunity","replies":[{"poster":"NOBLE105","date":"2015-10-24T07:18:18.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes but eventually people will complain about the ads, the funds could help improve the game but then again, like they say quality over quantity, in this case league is a very well worth playing game","replies":[]}]}
