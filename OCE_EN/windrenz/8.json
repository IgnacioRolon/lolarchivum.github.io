The idea of having crystal scar is because of the timers and adds pressure to having look at where a member needs to be.\r\nI don&#039;t know if there is a rule to the average game having to be around 20 minutes to surrender but that will be the time, and there surely must be a buff.\r\n{{champion:222}} The Quick Let&#039;s Defeat their Nexus Buff {{champion:51}} \r\nUser has twice the speed xp rate \r\nUser does more damage to towers\r\nUser has 50 more movement speed\r\nUser has prolonged buffs\r\nUser does more damage to jungle minions\r\nSummoner Cooldowns have been reduced\r\n{{champion:69}} Initial Buffs{{champion:131}} \r\nWhen a team has secured a team buff when an ally is in another rift, they will also have that buff given to them.\r\nIssues\r\nRecalling time will be reduced, and will be possible at Howling Abyss (you don&#039;t have to die to be able to buy).\r\nItems will all be included, even those that are unique to their own map however those with the same effect will both be put to cool down such as Wooglet&#039;s Witchcap and Zhonya&#039;s hourglass.\r\n{{summoner:1}} Revive will make its way back because why not? {{item:3070}} \r\nHow to win:\r\nThe first team to get 3 enemy nexus&#039; will win, however if it is draw, then both teams will result in a draw or loss prevented. OR enter a SUDDEN DEATH where if they are hit, they instantly die and the one(s) who is left will win it for their team.\r\n\r\nWell, this may be a tacky idea however i would think that this would be fun for all of the community.\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n{{champion:32}} Thanks for reading &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-11T16:13:10.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Drop Crystal scar and just do it with TT, Howling Abyss and SR.\n\nBest of 3 basically.\n\nThough the thing is, why wouldn't you just rush one and then compete for the third?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-07-11T08:55:57.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That seems too complicated for a lot of the player base to grasp and handle. A lot of people can't even handle 1 map. Perhaps just scale it back to 2 maps (probably just SR and TT), have items switch between counterparts for each map (for example Infinity Edge for SR and Lord Van Damm's Pillager for TT) and no \"sudden death\". Maybe even have it so you can only be on each map for a certain amount of time to make it more interesting and to create some incentive to switch.","replies":[]}]}
