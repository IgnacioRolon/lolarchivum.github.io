Instead of the 1 life part, i changed it a little:\n You are to eliminate all of the 5 enemy team members with your teammates in order obtain victory,  however you are set with a number of lives depending on your champion's role(s):\n{{champion:103}} Mage: 1 lives\n{{champion:84}}  Assassin: 1 life\n{{champion:12}}  Tank: 2 lives\n{{champion:15}} Marksmen/Markswomen: 1 lives\n{{champion:37}}  Support: 3 lives \nMaximum 4 lives, minimum 2 lives. If the champion only has one role, they automatically get an extra life.\n{{champion:74}} **Important things you should note down**{{champion:22}} \nYou begin with ~~15000~~ 12000 Gold and be at level 18 but once you exit base, you cannot return (you must fully leave base after 3 minutes from your spawn time mark otherwise marked as afk and not contributing with the game ( you have a chance of three passages if you get camped). if a player has disconnected and reconnected, they will lose a life (die on spot and considered executed if no enemy has contributed to their death) and able to respawn if they have more however if a player has been disconnected for more than 10 minutes and reconnects, they will lose all their lives instead.\n Minions will not spawn and turrets don't attack. Nexus' are untargettable. Recall is not available. The last person who survives will win it for their team (ignoring ~~all~~ some passives such as earths and Sion, Eggnivia and Zac still count as being alive). Average game length around 20 minutes depending on early deaths and teamwork, surrender at 20 available{{champion:26}} ). \nIf there are ~~5 people remaining~~ 10 lives remaining (when added up of all the champions), Fog of War will be lifted however you can still hide in the brushes (tall grass) and not be seen.{{champion:17}}  If it's been too long since the last death (occurs only roughly 5 minutes and only after 10:00 mark), {{summoner:6}} Ghosts of the dead players (untargettable, see through stealth and~~ uncontrollable but~~ are controllable by the dead, viewable through screen camera,{{champion:238}} {{champion:35}}  ~~preferably intermediate/doom bots)~~ will spawn and be able to hunt {{champion:107}} the remaining players regardless of them being on their team, only able to do auto attacks (no abilities) that deal 300 damage per attack If targeted. If killed by the ghost(s), you are considered executed however the killer(s) will show up in the death display as either a kill or assist but does not add up to the person's score{{champion:222}} . **(BEWARE OF GANG UPS, TRY TO BE NICE OTHERWISE YOU'RE DEAD{{champion:43}} )**\n{{champion:76}} **Jungle:** {{champion:421}} \nJungle creeps (despite baron, dragon and red & blue buffs) will not attack, giving chances to stacks and buffs to whomever kills them with smite. \nBaron allows each remaining players on the team to become fully healed and cool downs on items and skills to set. Baron will spawn at 15:00 mark\nDragon gives Dragon Slayer x5 buff. Dragon will spawn at the 10:00 mark.\nRed and Blue buffs: Give the red or blue buff and spawns as usual.\n{{champion:45}} **Unique Summoner Spells: **{{champion:117}} \n1. {{item:3157}} Stop! : become invulnerable for 2.5 seconds (just like Zhonyas and Wogglets) (250 second cool down)\n2. {{summoner:30}} I see you : Summon a familiar that may travel to a set distance , giving sight to anyone it sees and their surroundings for 10 seconds but has a 3 auto-attack death. (200 second cool down)\n3.{{summoner:31}}  Embrace me: Taunt {{champion:33}} an enemy champion into auto attacking yourself for 2.5 seconds. (250 second cool down)\n4. {{item:3151}} Farewell: Dispells one of the summoned ghosts. (Cool down of 150 seconds)\n{{champion:55}} **Other Available Summoner Spells: **{{champion:122}} \n Undew states:* \"I like it, take a away some summoner spells to make it a bit more challenging like heal, ignite, barrier, clarity, etc. basically to make team fights only fights with abilities of the champs.\"*\nThis is quite the request and a great idea to make the game more fairer so i removed some of these spells that may ruin the great team fights and reduce teamwork.\n~~1. Barrier~~{{summoner:21}} {{champion:92}} {{item:3070}} \n2. {{summoner:4}} Flash\n~~3.   Heal~~{{item:3070}} {{summoner:7}} {{item:3070}} \n~~4. Clarity~~{{champion:115}} {{item:2050}} {{item:3070}} \n5. {{summoner:2}} Clairvoyance\n6. {{summoner:6}} Ghost\n~~7. Ignite~~{{champion:63}} {{item:3070}} {{summoner:14}} {{item:3070}} {{champion:236}} \n8. {{summoner:12}} Teleport (available for wards and other objects such as Zac's blobs)\n9. {{summoner:11}} Smite\n~~10. Exhaust~~{{champion:36}} {{summoner:3}} \n11.{{summoner:1}} Cleanse\n12.{{summoner:10}} Revive\n{{champion:78}} **Banned items**{{champion:48}}  \n{{item:3026}} *Guardians Angel*, \n{{item:3041}} *Mejai's Soul stealer*, \n{{item:3141}} *Sword of the Occult*, \n{{item:3075}} *Thornmail.*\n{{item:3157}}  *Zhonya's hourglass*\nYou can only purchase the same item twice to prevent certain casualties of OPness and unkillable builds.\n\n**The purpose of this game mode is to promote team work and team fights. It can be both  fun seeing your friends die or crying to see yourself get dominated by the other team as well as the heart attack of being ambushed. You're able to improve your engaging, timing of abilities, map awareness and prediction of team fights despite being scared of dying by the deadly ghosts. It can also be a way of testing new builds and such since most games, you don't see a fed {{champion:6}}{{item:3031}}  Urgot or {{champion:40}} {{item:3089}} Janna do you?. **\n{{champion:16}} **This is a great idea in improving your League of Legends skills.**{{champion:81}}","replies":[{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-01-06T09:45:26.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok my team will be \n\n\nakali/kat/vayne/ ryze/ sona\n\n\nyou won't get 1 shotted, dw\n\ni like the concept though","replies":[{"poster":"Windrenz","date":"2015-01-06T10:24:39.732+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks! :3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Windrenz","date":"2015-01-06T09:23:15.483+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man no one checks the board xD {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-01-06T09:32:47.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You didn't even leave this post here for 10 minutes before complaining that no one was posting???

And will they deal damage? Having everyone start off at full build and exp will mean there's no point to farming or anything like that. Also, everyone is going to stay in base for three minutes because there'd be no reason to leave earlier, aside from dying early.\n\nAlso, what happens if you do get caught and die early? Are you just going to have to wait twenty+ minutes with the ability to do nothing while waiting for the game to end?\n\nAnd this \"lives based of role\" thing. It's enforcing a meta and also can be abused. Eg. Alistar is classed as a tank, but he can be built burst mage and still get the two lives.\n\nNeeds a bit more time in the cooker I reckon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yuriklatura","date":"2015-01-07T08:38:35.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is a good idea, but some champions would need to be tweaked so that they would be balanced since they start level 18 with a full build.\n\nVayne, Akali, Fizz, Rammus and Full AD Sion for example.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riso","date":"2015-01-06T11:55:46.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You must turn it into blind draft or else some people would be sad, but imagine {{champion:26}}  or {{champion:83}}","replies":[{"poster":"Windrenz","date":"2015-01-07T03:14:23.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We mustn't otherwise we can't ban the op champs. yes there will be unhappy people but that's the point in making modes like these: know who to ban otherwise there will be trouble.
