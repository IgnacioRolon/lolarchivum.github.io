I wanted to try and come up with a new idea and have decided to share it.\r\nI tried coming up with the name : Battle of the Roles (if you think it&#039;s tacky then try coming up with a better one){{champion:32}} \r\nBasically it is game mode where in champ select, the 10 players decide on a vote between which role they want to play (like in one for all). If it the maximum of votes are equal then both (or more) of the roles will become available.{{champion:115}} \r\n After that either one of the roles: \r\nAssassin{{champion:11}} , \r\nFighter{{champion:86}} ,\r\n Mage {{champion:13}} , \r\nMarksman {{champion:22}} \r\nSupport {{champion:89}}  and \r\nTank {{champion:154}} \r\n will be cut to only being able to choose champions that represent that role either both primarily and secondary (not owned champions will still be available). It is decided that the champion select should be blind pick.\r\n\r\nThis game mode is quite similar to Nemesis Draft however focuses more on the primary role and strategies in which may progress in that single role for both teams. For example: A full marksman team may go Quinn {{champion:133}}  for example who can possibly acquire large amounts of health or ones with global ultimates.\r\n\r\nIf there are any problems or comment you want to add, please be free to comment in the comment section. ...:) {{champion:37}}","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-14T14:45:55.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">If it the maximum of votes are equal then both (or more)\n\nHaving both roles defeats the purpose (have it run by the recent one for all mirror mode rules, Majority means you take it, no majority means you take the pick by randomness % wise.)\n\n>It is decided that the champion select should be blind pick.\n\nWhile i can agree blind champion picking, i still think you should be able to see what role each side takes.\n\nWould be an interesting mode, though i think Support/Fighter would be the stronger roles.","replies":[]}]}
