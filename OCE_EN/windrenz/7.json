(U.S.W.D.F)","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"**Ultra, Spectacular Week Days of fun!**\r\nI just absolutely LOVE the game modes that Riot has given us and today i am making a suggestion to bring them back so everyone will love certain days of the week!\r\nThere are 7 days where we can separate each special game mode to be primarily available on one day for 24 hours and so on. Personally, i think it's possible where you can always make minor improvements per patch every time you see things and at the same time, you can be given reports, suggestions, nerfs and bugs by our fellow LoL players to help improve the game modes until the time where you can actually release it as a new, permanent game mode!\r\nHere are the days that i believe should own their own game mode:\r\n{{champion:115}} Monday: U.R.F\r\n{{champion:115}} Tuesday: One for all (both types)\r\n{{champion:101}} Wednesday: Ascension\r\n{{champion:115}} Thursday: Doom Bots \r\n{{summoner:30}} Friday: Snowdown Showdown\r\n{{champion:115}} Saturday: Hexakill (SR and TT)\r\n{{champion:115}} Sunday: Dominion\r\nThis will help stop those people demanding specific game mode comment in official *League of Legends * posts. We simply just can't wait so why not bring it to us with a loud bang?\r\nNow if all else fails and Riot does not approve, they could always either make them available in custom games (hype!) or make this available for just one week! That's all we ask! (i use 'we' 'cos i know there are people out there that support this idea!){{champion:6}} {{champion:266}} {{item:3151}} \r\nThis thread does go in player creations right?

Maybe one week per month or 2-3 days per week for the game modes would be better so as not to affect other queues on a 24/7 basis since a lot of people would be playing them instead of what's available now. Also, having them available so often would mean they'd get old fast, better to have them available every now and then and enjoy them each time you play.","replies":[]}]}
