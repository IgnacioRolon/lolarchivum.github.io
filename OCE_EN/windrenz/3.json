It's kinda hard to see every bit of the drawing. Like, it's not as defined so it's hard to differentiate one section from another. Maybe try some shading or darker lines if you're not going to colour it? I think a lot of people are the same as me when they draw it, then add colour.  BOOM! Killed it ;-; All that effort. Goodluck! {{champion:117}}","replies":[{"poster":"Windrenz","date":"2015-01-21T06:41:25.507+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha thanks!
