I've personally seen more French speakers than Korean.\n\nAnd a lot of the \"Chinese\" trolls are in reality just Aussie trolls who are also bad in English for whatever reason. The reason for that is because they don't actually know what the meaning of the whatever they say is, if you are bothered enough to quiz them on it (for instance, I've got 3 people spamming \"sb\" in my match today, and none of them actually really know what \"sb\" or \"shabi\" are despite their frequent spamming of the terms, when I quizzed them in the post-game lobby. They thought it is a load-word meant to be \"so bad\", when in reality the term means \"idiot\"); they seem to just be copy-pasting, which also unintentionally or intentionally forward this stereotype.\n\nMaybe Ranked has more of the actually toxic Chinese players, and if they come in premades (but then again, most premades are toxic to begin with, for 1 reason or the other), but in solo Normals I'd find most of them are not speakers of the language but English trolls who use copy-pasta as feints.\n\nOCE is toxic, thats for sure tho.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-07-11T12:28:31.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think in almost 6 years I can recall maybe 3 games where there was something obviously Korean, and none of it struck me as toxic, by action, context or otherwise.\n\nFor the longest time though I did think sb was 'so bad' in the way of lol and afk etc. Contextually it made sense and I had no evidence to the contrary, nor am I the type to say it with either meaning.
