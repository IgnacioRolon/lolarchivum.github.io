I know 100% that I haven't, ever! The only time I've received notifications is form a person who was verbally abusing others and we all know that side of the system works.\n\nIt's also a fact that known accounts botting, scripting, griefing and intent feeding are still be played to this day even after being reported repeatedly. \n\nIf it really takes months upon months for a person to be banned then surely that in itself suggest the system is broken and needs fixing?","replies":[]},{"poster":"LetsTwitch","date":"2017-06-11T01:17:09.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It takes time, they have to sort out the tilted people reporting someone for a bad game and those actually inting.\n\nThe guy will get banned if he trolls but it's not instant because as far as the system can tell he was just playing poorly and you 4 on his team decided to report him for that rather than him inting. The system isnt broken, it's just slow. People are banned all the time but anyone could randomly get so tilted they feed meaning theres millions of players that could do this at any one time. He might not have been banned that day but 1000 others could have been that you never met and never will meet because of that system.","replies":[]}]}
