I'll just get the message \"Connection to spectator server failed. Would you like to retry?\" or I'll get to the loading screen of the game I'm trying to spectate and everything will freeze. To further this, when I DO actually connect to the game I'm trying to spectate, it will work for about two seconds before everything stops moving and it disconnects again. I don't know what the issue is, because it's not my internet/computer, and I've tried repairing the client. Any other suggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"Sir King Boss","date":"2014-12-22T07:08:45.747+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"mine loads then freezes 2 seconds later\n","replies":[]}]}
