I started playing late last season, and since then I&#039;ve climbed from silver 2 to platinum 2, still gaining 28 lp a game. So I should be able to make it to diamond 5 atleast as an ADC/JG main. \r\nI coached professionally in Dota 2, focusing on high elo decision making and mechanical play, and I think I&#039;ve become experienced enough in LoL to begin doing that. I&#039;ve been coaching some mid elo friends/players for free to get the hang of it.\r\nBut where do I go next? How can I move my coaching upwards to possibly paid or team coaching?\r\n\r\nSide question: What is the standard form of coaching in LoL. I&#039;ve been doing replay, 1v1 and in-game coaching, but my internet isn&#039;t good enough to stream.","replies":[]}
