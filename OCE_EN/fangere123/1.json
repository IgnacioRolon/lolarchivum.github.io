Started ranked this season, maining ADC. Can play any ADC but Draven, but preferred are Ezreal, Kai&#039;sa and Kalista. \r\nAlso play jg, maining Jax, Zac and Evelynn.\r\nPreviously played as Flair Gaming&#039;s Pos 1 (carry) player, peaking at team ranking 7th best in Oceania, so I have experience in a professional environment and team play. Been learning LoL and now have about 1.5k games total, with around 120 in ranked. \r\nOP.GG: http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=fangere123 \r\nCan also play midlane at plat level, but champion pool is very limited (Ryze, Corki and Ekko)\r\n\r\nLooking to enter a team environment in LoL, and see what experiences I get out of that and where it takes me.","replies":[]}
