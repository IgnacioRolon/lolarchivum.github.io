When i report them i dont want to see them again because its always the same result.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-20T06:03:54.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way I see it, is that if you're grouped with that same toxic player again in a match, you have another opportunity to report them. If you really want to avoid them, though, after the game ends, wait about five minutes. They should have found their own game by then, and you'll not likely ever see them again.\n\nThis is unrelated to a Tribunal system, which is actually just 'in the works'. It won't be activated for a while yet.\n\nHope that helps.","replies":[]}]}
