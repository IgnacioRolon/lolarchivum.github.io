Though many tried to fight and they received Lamb&rsquo;s arrow, while others ran and they sated Wolf&rsquo;s hunger. Then to them came the footsteps as loud as thunder.\r\n\r\nWolf: It is RUNNING!\r\nLamb: We will see.\r\nWolf: Let me chase it!\r\nLamb Let us chase it!\r\nWolf: MINE!\r\nLamb: OURS!\r\n\r\nThe farmer ran dragging his wife and child behind him, he noticed us, he ran faster.\r\n\r\nLamb: Wolf.\r\nWolf: Lamb.\r\nLamb: Chase.\r\nWolf: FINALLY!\r\n\r\nThe shadows swirled around in the bright snow. The shadows then solidified and tripped the man, he fell straight into wolf&rsquo;s jaws; they snapped shut ending his life brutally and painfully. The woman screamed and stared as Wolf returned to Lamb. \r\n\r\nLamb: Hello, dear Beth.\r\nBeth: How did you know my name?\r\nWolf: We know your name.\r\nLamb: and we have always known.\r\nBeth: But why him and why now?\r\nLamb: Because it was his time.\r\nWolf: and he RAN!\r\nLamb: But that is besides the point dear Beth, You know who we are.\r\nBeth: You&rsquo;re Lamb and that is Wolf, together you&rsquo;re Kindred.\r\nLamb: And never one.\r\nWolf: Without the other.\r\nBeth: Please just leave!\r\nLamb: You much choose.\r\nWolf: TO DIE!\r\nLamb: Or to run.\r\nBeth: Then it is decided.\r\nLamb: It has always been this choice.\r\nWolf: for we already knew!\r\nLamb: You would run.\r\nWolf: AND I WOULD CHASE!\r\n\r\nWith a heartfelt scream she ran for it, she turned around to see that kindred was gone, but when she looked forward again she ran straight into a bandit&rsquo;s sword.\r\n\r\nLamb: Nobody can run from us, and those who do.\r\nWolf: WISH THEY HADN&rsquo;T!","replies":[]}
