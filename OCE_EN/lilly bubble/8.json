Also the one auto attacking a minion under tower preparing it for last hitting by adc. There is so much more than just buying a gold item and attacking the enemy as supp.\nBot lane needs synergy, timing, patience and not many bronzies have that. I have had a silver 5 janna support who was brilliant and I got fed but after that I had two morons with no clue so I stopped playing adc.","replies":[{"poster":"LetsTwitch","date":"2016-09-26T03:26:19.139+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me, cs isnt a problem in lane. I can easily get kills and still have 85%+ of the cs.\n\nThe real problem comes later when in bronze everyone wants to fight 24/7 and if I want to clear sidelanes we generally lose the fight.\n\nI dont farm when an objective is up but mostly the fights are started because say my jungle gets caught out and everyone tries to fight at top river while im clearing bot wave.\n\nMeaning that in order to not lose fights all the time I skip out on 100ish cs.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-09-26T08:33:53.182+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah you kinda have to always be grouped in a Bronze game because the concept of \"Catching up\" or \"Farming up\" or even \"clearing lanes\" just doesn't occur to most bronzies.\n\nThat said, i question if you are actually getting 85% of the CS when a quick look at your OP.GG in your ADC games sees you at 6-7 CS a minute (which is actually extremely low, because the CS rate is 12 spawning a minute at least once they start spawning.)\n\nSo if that's actually true, then good on you, but you may want to check that personally, because personally i know that your finished game CSing is not up to scratch (though i understand the bronze walking in strategy)","replies":[{"poster":"LetsTwitch","date":"2016-09-26T10:58:19.262+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In lane I hit about 140-150 cs at 13-15 mins which is ~85% but out of lane my cs goes way down and I know that so I'm working on it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-09-26T08:37:41.583+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">The problem I find is that the enemy don't want to cs\n\nI mean that's not a massive issue most of the time, because either they are giving up CS to try and harass you, or your letting them harass you for free by not position properly yourself.\n\nBelieve it or not, you can actually out trade an enemy in bronze by simply CSing because a lot of bronzies will do the whole 1 auto and take all the minion agro Shtick and screw themselves over because they don't know how to properly drop agro.\n\nThat said, if your positioned properly and only last hit in most scenarios, you can last hit and harass the enemy at the same time, even without the support doing all that much.\n\nThe problem most ADC's in bronze have, tends to be the whole \"oh i took a (Insert CC here) and died, that's my supports fault\", but the same occurs for most bronzie supports, where they don't have the capacity to know how to position to stop any aggresive moves on their ADC, so that their ADC isn't in the position to be hit by said CC.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"veo","date":"2016-09-28T10:29:05.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bronze 1 ADC main.
