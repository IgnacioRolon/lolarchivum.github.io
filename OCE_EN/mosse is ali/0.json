Tanks being able to do 50k damage while taking 65k and dying 2 times should not happen. That's pretty much Garen in a nutshell, I know the term broken gets tossed around a ton today but I think (my opinion you don't have to agree) Garen is legit broken. The fact that he can build 2 items (Warmogs and SV) and have nearly 150+ health regen is broken, because at the same time he can build no damage items and still do a ridiculous amount of damage. Seriously, if you build SV, Warmogs, Sunfire, Banshees, Tabi's, and a Thornmail you will die maybe 2 times the entire game. This combined with the fact that Garen is braindead easy to play is just ridiculous, with that build he can deal almost 20k damage of ap and ad for a total of around 40k damage to champs, **HOW IS THAT FAIR**.  He becomes pretty much unkillable and can kill pretty much anything if that isn't broken I don't know what is. He's not the only champ that's like that either, Amumu, Sej, Gragas, Cho'Gath and many more can do the same thing. The tank meta has made the game extremely boring for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Mõssy","date":"2015-06-10T05:01:58.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree garen is way to op","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mõssy","date":"2015-06-10T05:00:55.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that it is making the game much less fun because all you really do is stand there absorbing nothing because the enemy is all low dps tank team and its not as exiting as other metas","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2015-05-28T10:47:54.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm loving the meta.

They take good timing, often take a lot of skill and get punished for mistakes if they are versing able enemies, often they don't have good disengage (good enough for how deep they often are in teamfights) and it's easy to fail at tanking - if anyone takes less skill - it's carries because they are very straight forward and while they take a lot of positioning - if you don't know what you are doing you will lose - but while a tank benefits from taking hits in a lot of cases, being able to maximise their skillset, time engages, retreat at the right time, bait and also be landing autos and timing rundowns to keep in range for skills - or positioning is important - making them quite skill-requiring.\n\nI hate that a lot of the burstiness of the game has been removed but a lot of the more powerful tanking items have been removed so tanks now aren't the brick walls late game they used to be so if anything I think it's less of a tank meta at the moment and more of a bruiser/sustained damage meta and as such countering this with your own sustained damage (maybe taking defense as an ADC or taking some %HP dmg or %hp damage champions is a good idea to deal with what might be a lot of sejaunis, Gragas's, Garens, Mundo's, Trundles and Maokai's being picked and played).\n\nBear in mind the new jungle made life easier for a lot of these champs and has made it harder for more AD or burst Based junglers so remember to pick Champions that can deal with tanky junglers etc or consider itemising against them and I don't think you'll have a problem - let alone be bored.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Autismo Extremo","date":"2015-04-24T07:18:59.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nah maaan tank meta is awesome because i get to build zero damage items, face tank 5 people and walk out with a kill","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-04-24T08:45:12.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sejauni in a nutshell.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Worst Mid Ever","date":"2015-04-23T22:17:20.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like how an item gets a minor stat change, a pro complains about it and then people think it changes the entire game, if tanks are so good why are you still playing and winning with a massive winrate on riven?","replies":[{"poster":"mosse is ali","date":"2015-04-24T01:28:34.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cause shes my bae :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-04-23T21:19:34.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The tank meta is fkin terrible, it was terrible in season 3 and its terrible now in season 5, tank meta will always be boring and require less skill because that's just how tanks are, tanks require the least amount of skill out of all the champs, you don't need a brain to play these champs, just go full tank and you'll still do ridiculous amounts of damage.\n\nSay what you want about the assassin meta, but at least those champs required skill, it was fun because it required you to outplay your opponent unlike the tank meta...","replies":[{"poster":"mosse is ali","date":"2015-04-24T01:27:48.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"YES totally agree","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-04-24T00:37:34.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only way I'll enjoy the tank meta is if BT was buffed so that the ADC build path would be something like (BT > Greaves > PD/Ghostblade > LW).
