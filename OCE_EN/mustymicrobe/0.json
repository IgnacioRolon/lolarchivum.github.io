After the Chicago move my ping averaged between 80-100 ping; bearable. Since the latest patch, it jumps betwixt 80-1000 every two minutes or so. Constant disconnects plague my games, and the ping spikes make it impossible to even move at times, much less do ANYTHING else.\r\n\r\nI have tried updating adapter drivers, turning p2p sharing off/on, ipv6 settings on/off, etc. In fact, I&#039;ve tried everything I know to do to improve my ping. Leatrix, TCP Optimizer, etc. Nothing has worked. It&#039;s not an ISP issue and it&#039;s not a LAN issue. My internet works fine in every other application I might run that requires a connection.\r\n\r\nI have scoured the internet for any related threads but haven&#039;t seen anything yet, so alas, here I am; hoping a tech guru from some magical land might have an answer.","replies":[{"poster":"iLiKeTuRtLeS","date":"2016-04-26T07:28:56.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same, nearly every game now I get a sudden spike in which I cant move as soon as the spike starts happening (so when it goes to even 300 ping I cant move do anything, like I am not controlling my keyboard and mouse). Went up to 13000 the first few times then up to 14000 <-------- (recorded that one and also most recent). When it spikes it disconnects for a period of time. Sometimes when I get lucky I disconnect in the jg and I can still make a comeback from being 2 levels behind. The spike at first seems to happen only once per game and I go back to my former 26 ping after 3 minutes of disconnection but in my most recent game (the 14000 ping game) the ping spikes to 200-700 and stays there for extended periods of time (the 14000 ping happened when I was around lvl 2 as do most of my over 10,000 ping spikes ive been experiencing) and throughout the game (these new spikes happen after the 18 minute mark for and keeps reoccurring lagging nearly 3/5 of the time after 18 mins).\n\nI have no programs other than league on (absolutely nothing but league) and I switch off the wifi on all devices every time I play","replies":[{"poster":"iLiKeTuRtLeS","date":"2016-04-26T07:29:36.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh and this happened ever since 6.8 as well","replies":[]}]}]}
