HOW HYPOCRITICAL COULD YOU POSSIBLY BE TO ACCUSE ME OF NOT BEING OPEN FOR DISCUSSION WHEN YOU HAVE LITERALLY SUPPLIED NO POSSIBLE MEANS OF OPENING A DIALOGUE???????!!!!!!????? \r\nAlthough to be fair i shouldnt expect so much from moral crusaders who believe unfair treatment and punishment is a lesser offensive that using naughty words even when arguably justifiable.\r\n\r\nP.s i hope the person who i mention in this post censors me again and removes this only to send me another passive aggressive rant thats full of backwards thinking and little to no logic without any means of reply.

Your means to respond which you say I did not give you is precisely this, namely making a new post that follows the board rules (which is also what I suggested you do). Excessive use of the c word and explicit sexual descriptions of what you want someone to do because you don't like them well and truly breaks the rules. It was not something so simple as swearing that got your posts removed. \n\nYou demonstrate a lot of frustration here but that is perfectly ok, anyone who doesn't want to read your post can move on, but the important thing is that you haven't broken any rules with this one, though it's borderline. Abusing anyone, even a mod, still falls under the \"Don't be a Jerk\" rule but I'm not that petty.\n\nIf it was a matter of censorship I would have banned you from boards entirely without warning.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sad little benju","date":"2016-11-25T10:34:55.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just come here for the salt (8 thank you","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-11-25T10:01:04.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I wrote a post complaining about the unfair nature of my recently acquired two week ban admittedly i used what is often called \"mature\" language.\n\nYour post linked a song and then got straight into calling Riot a \"beta bitch company\" as well as a bunch of other malicious words, most too obscene to be posting on the boards. If you would like to discuss your 14 day suspension, you can do so respectfully without all the cussing. \n\nOn that note, I would like to remind you that YOU are accountable for YOUR OWN actions. If you received a 14 day ban it is unlikely the first time you have \"flown off the handle\" or if it is, it is possible you were using sexist/racist/homophobic language that would have automatically escalated your ban. It doesn't matter if your team are doing the same to you, you should never stoop to their level. Just report them and move on. \n\nThe second post you posted was basically the same thing, but instead of complaining about your 14 day in-game suspension you complained about being censored. You then again launched into a tirade of hateful language, some of which could be considered sexist and homophobic ([huge no-nos in the league of legends community)](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules)\n\nCalling someone a \"pile of putrid dog sick\" isn't really helping your case either. I must admit from what I have seen, your ban would have been 100% deserved. \n\n>Don’t be a jerk\n\n>We’re aiming for the most sportsmanlike gaming community in the world, in-game and out.
