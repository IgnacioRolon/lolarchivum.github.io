But I will be quitting out of principal because the tribunal is a disaster. Riot takes sides of passivly toxic trolls who dive turrents and supports who steal sc rather than taking sides of people who are over-spoken. If the chat is the #1 reason for bans than maybe just remove it instead of banning people who get provoked by others. The tribunal has to go and the banned accounts need to be unbanned.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-01-22T00:37:00.347+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The tribunal has to go\n\nWell, good news! There is no tribunal! It was removed entirely a several years ago so riot could supposedly try to improve it, however there's been no word  on how that project is moving along so it's reasonable to assume it's been left behind and wont be appearing again.\n\n> If the chat is the #1 reason for bans than maybe just remove it instead of banning people who get provoked by others.\n\nThe people who are provoked into doing the wrong thing are still doing the wrong thing. If you lack the basic self control to not react to the bullsh!t of others, that's a fault of yours, not Riot's.\n\n> But I will be quitting\n\nYou wont be missed.\n\nThen again, you'll probably be crawling back in a few months time (if not sooner).","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2017-01-22T17:52:08.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> You wont be missed.\n> \n> Then again, you&#x27;ll probably be crawling back in a few months time (if not sooner).\n\nSavage, but true, you'll be back.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Soulhavok","date":"2017-01-23T08:25:37.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys just ignore this post he is spamming all regions with his qq posts.\n\nLike old school Spartans let's just throw this reject baby over the cliff","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrPine","date":"2017-01-21T21:47:35.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bye felisha","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2017-01-22T18:22:28.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well ideally actually I'd rather toxicity be allowed in chat in its entirety but that will never happen,","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2017-01-22T18:22:02.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"People who would get banned for stuff said in chat should just have chat privilege revoked permanently.
