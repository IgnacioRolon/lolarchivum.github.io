Though I can&#039;t win a single game. Around when I was level 10 - 20 I was winning and carrying every game. Though now at level 30 I can&#039;t do anything, I&#039;m better in general skill and only play normal (due to being bad) to not ruin ranked games. I usually play teemo but have branched out to most champions now but just feed and get destroyed every single round. \r\n\r\nTl;dr I&#039;ve somehow gotten better but am doing worse. The game is generally not fun getting absolutely demolished as soon as I enter lane again (Aggressive players) or outplayed in every fight. How do I just have fun again?","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-06-07T04:21:13.351+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might consider playing the Rotating Game Modes when they are up too. Not only do you get similar mastery and party rewards as you do on SR but there's none of the pressure (except for urf which is tryhard deluxe).","replies":[]},{"poster":"RUSTYtheCASTER","date":"2016-06-07T03:20:09.462+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to echo the sentiment of Princess Yaia here, finding a group of friends can be invaluable for your better experience.\nI could provide you with suggestions for everything, but it feels like you losing lane causes a negative experience and I share this sentiment quite heavily. I just learnt to put on my headset and let the game happen! Friends makes this a little bit easier~\n\nGLHF!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-06-06T20:09:21.797+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to hear that you aren't having much fun playing league. \n\nMy biggest suggestion to bringing the fun back into it (whether you win or lose) is to find a solid group of friends that you can regularly play with. Playing with friends is way less toxic and more fun, as you can keep morale up through voice chat even when you're losing. It also gives bonus IP and mastery points. Try either on the t[eam recruitment ](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment)board or the [clubs](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/clubs) board. \n\nAnother thing you could do is take a break away from league, and play something else for a while.\n\nLeague of legends is a game that takes a lot of time and effort to learn (especially if you aren't familiar with this style of game). Sometimes when playing off and on like you have, you come back and it feels completely new with their mid year and beginning of season changes. It can take a lil while to re-adjust and start doing well against people that play consistently.\n\nGood luck with whatever you decide to do ♥","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2016-06-06T14:54:21.266+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You stop playing League of Legends, this game is only going to keep getting more boring for solo players","replies":[]}]}
