Did something happen to the skill level of the games I&#039;m in or should I just not play (I&#039;m causing my team to lose in most games) ps.

Sure kills are great but if you can't work as a team and take objectives gg.\n\nWatch the map like a hawk. Play safe if you don't know where the enemy jungler is. If your opponent is passive thwn starts going ham... get out jungler is there.  If you go to ward dat bush and they start going all in get out the jungler is in that bush\nIf you see enemy jungler on map.. ping it. If you see jungler no where near you go a little ham on your opponent\n\nWard.. ping wards. \n\nWatch your enemy.. if they poke with spells. . Let em run out of mana then go in\n\nTime enemy spells.  Bait out that spell.  Bait their escape.  Scare their flash oitta them\n\nPing the enemy you gonna focus let the team know ult is up or ult in 15 let em know you dont have ult\n\nIf you low on health or mana. Don't go in\n\nDont chase that enemy into unwarded jungle.  If you've killed 3 or 4 of em.. go for a tower don't chase that low hp guy. . He cant stop ya\n \nBe aware of baron and drag timers\n\nWatch lanes if adc and supp are bot right away. . Jungler started top and will likely gank bot or mid around 3 mins or so","replies":[{"poster":"FreezingPandora","date":"2016-04-06T07:17:45.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you.

Good job!\n\nAlso if you are a top laner, consider getting a blue trinket at level 9. It's free and you can ward without facechecking bushes that might have enemies in it. You can also spot people collapsing towards you. This all while smashing the towers in your lane.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-04-05T16:28:57.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe coz the last two updates changed some of the champ abilities","replies":[]}]}
