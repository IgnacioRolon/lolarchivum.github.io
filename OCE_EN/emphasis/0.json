I&#039;m looking for other players who are on frequently and like playing 5s. Not overly keen on strict time tables or &quot;Pro Team Mentalities&quot;. If you are out there playing 5s in the upper elos and need another person, hit me up in-game. I also have some friends interested too if you yourself want to join in on 5s, or have a couple people and need a couple more then I&#039;m sure we can arrange something there too. \r\n\r\nWhile I do enjoy playing with everyone the main focus with 5s for me is to win, so obviously previous or current experience in higher elos (namely diamond or challenger) is always a plus. While playing 5s I try and keep the atmosphere fun and enjoyable in skype etc, but at the end of the day I&#039;m there to put pretty little icons on my video game account.","replies":[{"poster":"Distinct","date":"2015-07-28T05:50:52.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I added you ingame. \nI'm currently Diamond 5, I'm on frequently and enjoy playing ranked 5s.","replies":[]}]}
