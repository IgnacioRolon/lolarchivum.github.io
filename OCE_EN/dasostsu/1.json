Even the player is typing since the very first seconds and until the very last seconds, they should dont be moving or attacking the enemies at all and they should sit in the jungle and use glitchs to afk! They will not get banned by riot! Not even the account is bought from someone else! They can sell the accounts later! It is accepted by RIOT as it is never being fixed and never been banned!\n\nI mean, seriously, who cares if the new player who bought this account and probably have hired pro player to rank up their ELO team up with you and troll you badly in ranked game, it is a computer game, why does it matter if he can play well or not, a lot of world champion player can carry the game 1 vs 5 if need","replies":[{"poster":"Corsage","date":"2015-11-30T10:17:24.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot implement a system where a new account can be suspended if logged into a different IP at many point in time. After reading your somewhat sarcastic comment I feel the need to pin point something , I didn't say that this should not be a bannable offence , I'm only stating that it is a bot game and since a lot of lv 30 do play this game mode  to test champion so they will more likely carry the game against bot. \n\nAbout your account purchase statement, this is up to someone choice to do it , it is against ToS but a lot of people do break ToS , I personally haven't done it but if someone really want a smurf without the effort , it's their money gone if they get ban. About booster from your comment, a lot of boosting have been done in the past, what make a new account any different, an account get boosted everyday with rank achieved that they don't deserve, a new one getting played to obtain a non-realistic rank in the preseason. The preseason will end and their rank will be as good as gone , that sweet \"money\" gone.\n\nLeague is about achieving and competition as well , people will feel better achieving their ranks (presumption) over buying boost to quote \" be at the rank they deserve\" ; those people who buy boost will only be wasting their money for a victorious skin, a lot of account that were boosted don't stay at their rank for long. Yes it will ruin games , and it's awful when someone who got boosted is in your rank game feeding ( I know the feel , vs'd a lot of boosted account), but those account don't stay at the elo they were boosted for long , since the system will balance them out and soon they will be at their rightful MMR.\n\nAgain I never state that I against this being a bannable offense, I'm only stating that bot games are carried , I don't support the method and I do think it's a bannable offense. My post above only explain how the method work , I never gave a side to side opinon based comment on which side I take, and I do see people being able to carry 1v5, by snowballing their lane and get other gold through tower/assist in kills. Being a world class player , carrying 1v5 is not impossible, it would be really hard since you are vsing world class people as well.\n\nTL;DR : Never stated a side, only give description , vivid statement mistook; not enough info given (mainly rant)","replies":[{"poster":"Dasostsu","date":"2015-11-30T10:45:27.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo afk glitch still work btw, all you need to do it kill a camp, still there and dont move so your sunfire cape thingy can dmg the camp while you are in stealth mode","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"XPitchPleaseX","date":"2015-11-30T11:04:51.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"um i hope u guys realize this is Bots.... who cares if a lvl 6 afks in bots... when he gets into norms he will eventually get banned","replies":[]}]}
