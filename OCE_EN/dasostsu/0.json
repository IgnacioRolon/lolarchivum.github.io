I know it is the time to carry them again so I farmed hard to get fed.\r\n\r\nbot lane Tahm Kench was in danger and I took a bullet for him as he is the only intelligent-seeming player in the game. Yes I am not an intelligent player as I realized that the Tahm Kench I just saved spam recall button when being attacked at an amazing speed that in between every tick of morgana&#039;s pool dmg he can actually start a cast of recall. He is also one of them.\r\n\r\nIt is like a zombie apocalypse while you have 4 friendly zombie on your side who wont harm you but secretly providing assist to the enemy by random dying and give opponents better gears.\r\n\r\nThat was a really fun game. Luckily I picked Ezreal and it is easy to kite back and forward because my opponent does not have flash at all.\r\n\r\nAfter a good 15 minutes or so Enemy finally decided go all mid and therefore my Ally zombie can stop dying that much.... Ooops! they got executed by tower!\r\n\r\nAlright then I slowly and slowly dealt some damage to enemy turrets and finally got the inhibitor turret down, I wait the enemy to push a bit forward and got the inhibitor so super minions would starting spawning, and then I knew I have just granted an extra 150 IP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI know Riot is really tired to design new champions to sell at high IP.. I have seen people with tons of IP in their accounts and cannot use the IP for anything. Maybe they designed some zombies in coop AI game to slow people down from getting free 150 IP daily. But I am sorry it is not going to happen on me, I have won 1,000+ AI game in a roll and I am not gonna stop for first wins. Of course RIOT wont ban this, this is free-win preventing mechanism and it is very important\r\n\r\nSuggestions to RIOT: using some AI&#039;s like the anivia or trundle to stop my recall spell to make it harder to get first win, improve immediate AI&#039;s intelligence so it is actually harder in a good way. Or disable the COOP vs AI mode because sometime it will be 5 AIs vs 5 AIs, that is wasting the server&#039;s bandwidth\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR: ban those shitty accounts using scripts in AI game","replies":[{"poster":"See you in D5","date":"2016-01-11T10:32:10.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You died to bots. _Nice_.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-01-10T16:32:08.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah im sick of these bots too.
