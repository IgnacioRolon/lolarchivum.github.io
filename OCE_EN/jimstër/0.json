I'm an Evelynn one-trick but I can also play Annie. Excluding those, I'm utter garbage at every single champion. \n\nSo, when I'm auto-filled into ADC, I pick Annie. Not because she's good at ADC or I'm trolling or I'm \"breaking the meta\", but because Annie would be better at ADC than Evelynn. If I were to pick an actual ADC, no matter how well I play, I'll still end up feeding and losing the game. At least with Annie, I have a chance of not feeding and winning.\n\nBut I agree with you. There should be a Troll Report thing in Champ Select.
