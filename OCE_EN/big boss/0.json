I was playing adc and had the taric glues to me the entire laning phase, not casting abilities or helping in any way other than making it hard for me to move because he was always on me. Is this sort of thing allowed? There is no possible way he was legitimately playing both accounts at the same time. He streamed the whole thing and seemed to think that even if i video&#039;d it and sent it to riot that he would not be banned. Curious and annoyed because he made us play a 4v5, his excuse was that is was a handicap for him. But i am meant to be around low gold so i dont need a handicap to have a hard time. Giving me no choice in the matter. Would like to hear all thought on the this!","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-08-12T22:02:24.350+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Is this sort of thing allowed?\n\nQuite simply, no. It falls squarely under the \"cheating/third party software\" category, and is taken pretty seriously according to Riot.\n\n> He streamed the whole thing and seemed to think that even if i video'd it and sent it to riot that he would not be banned.\n\nIf they're streaming it, that's probably all the proof you need that they're breaking the rules. Chances are those videos will persist for some time on whatever site the player was using to stream, so a support agent should be able to refer to them if you provided a link.\n\nI would definitely recommend you submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"I want to report abusive behaviour, cheating, or a malicious link\" option), describe the situation to them, provide as much evidence as you can (such as a link to the stream they've been using, if you have it, or other video evidence) and they will go through the process of reviewing the account.\n\nKeep in mind, it may take a day or two to receive a response, especially if Support is busy, and you'll probably receive a generic \"copy-paste\" response unless you're requesting specific information or the support agent requests something from you (such as more information). You wont be informed if the player gets punished, as that's a long standing policy of Riot's, and they likely wont provide much anyway since it does fall under \"third party software\" (again, due to a long standing policy).\n\nHope this helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-08-13T21:40:21.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you send in a ticket to support, I'm interested in the outcome. Perhaps he will be right that nothing will happen. I mean the automated system can't detect that kind of cheating. And if Riot don't bother to use a human to investigate, nothing will happen.\n\nCheats can always come up with new ways to game automated (AI) systems. Riot probably are playing the percentages that most cheats are not smart and their automated system picks up the majority of cases. Unlucky for your experience.\n\nAs a side note, this just shows how low skill level is in OCE if Golds cannot win a 5v4.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2018-08-12T22:53:47.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very interesting indeed! I have checked their records on OPGG and seems your are correct about it! They played the last 20 games together and that Taric's scores are all negative but the host's seems to be carrying in most of their games win or lose. Unlucky for you, your game is a lost as they have a positive win rate over all.","replies":[]}]}
