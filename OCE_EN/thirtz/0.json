It&#039;s annoying seeing people perma-logged in on my friend list that are not actually online to play with. Especially those users who haven&#039;t even logged into the client in months and are essentially inactive. I have had to remove the app from my phone and after 3 days I still appear in my friend's friend list. Any idea whether this is being looked at?","replies":[{"poster":"FreexerJr","date":"2016-06-07T05:46:34.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to bump this.
