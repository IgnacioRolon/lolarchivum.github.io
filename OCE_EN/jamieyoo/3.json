Remember, it doesn't matter whether _\"they started it\"_, just because someone else is an asshole it doesn't give you the right to be one too.\n\nYou also didn't receive two punishments for one game BTW. One of them is for a previous game. You must have just queued up before the report could be processed.","replies":[]}]}
