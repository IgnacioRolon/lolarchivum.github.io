You can play ranked without having to worry about losing your rewards, but if you go down it will affect your mmr for the provisionals next season.\n\nI read somewhere that you can't go down from gold 5 to silver 1 unless you have the mmr of Silver 5.(This part could be wrong though)","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2015-11-11T20:12:03.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol your not wrong.","replies":[]}]}]}
