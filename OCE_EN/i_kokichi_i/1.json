Been thinking y&#039;know, why can&#039;t I make that jump to plat, what am I doing wrong. I think I finally identified the main thing holding my play back right now. Around 80% of my games where I lose playing jungle, I will have a lead in the early game, I myself will be for example, 5/1/5 or something. But then will still end up losing. The problem is my transition from early game to mid game. I play well in all stages of the game I feel, but my transition between early and mid is terrible. I will sometimes make stupid play after stupid playing and go from the 5/1/5 to 5/5/7 and such. I could really use some tips to help me keep a stable transition through that stage consistently. The tips don&#039;t necessarily have to relate to being ahead in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2016-04-03T07:54:14.373+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not a jungle main, but I have been in master tier for a season or so, and am currently between the ranks of diamond V-III so here is my advice on the issues you are having atm.\n\nOne problem that you will find that causes you to have a lot of deaths going from early to mid game will be how your team handles getting objectives. Everyone has their own plan in mind and majority of the time these plans won't meet up. To prevent this from happening especially as a jungler be the shot caller your team needs and keep them focused on what they need to be doing and what the plan is moving ahead. Call out objectives you want to take or towers you want to destroy. Communicate to your team to either group up or if someone needs to be split pushing.\n\nUsing this you can rotate wards from your support and your pink wards and trinkets from the rest of the team around the current objective that you plan to take or defend. If you want to push down a bot lane tower as a team get some wards down as a team in their bottom side jungle so you know where the enemies are when they come to defend or if someone is coming for a sneaking flank. The same applies for if you are trying to defend your top tower when behind, ward up your top side jungle (safely without getting caught!) so that you can see where the enemies are and catch out people who are alone as a team and snowball the game back in your favor!\n\n**What happens if my team doesn't listen to me? You may ask yourself**\n\nSometimes you may find that certain members of your team may not listen to you. One way to get more people to listen to you in the early game is to get them talking before minions spawn or even champion select. Tell them what lanes you plan to camp, how comfortable your laners are in their match-ups so that you know how to adjust your jungle clear accordingly. You can also communicate if you are going for an invade after your first buff on the enemy's red or blue buff and warn your team ahead of time so that they are ready to follow up and collapse if needed.\n\nFollowing these steps and getting your team to start talking early creates a positive environment in the chat and keeps your team focused on what they need to do. Don't just stop this after minions have spawned though, talk ahead of time of what your plans are such as \"coming bot after red buff\" or etc. Once you transition into the mid game, your team will be so used to following your shot calls you can use this to your advantage and keep them focused on what objectives or towers they need to be taking.\n\n**Vision, Wards and MORE VISION!**\n\nOne very overlooked thing is the power of vision from a jungler. Try to be buying as many pink wards as you can if you have the gold for it, and use your trinkets smartly. For example if you are going for a gank into the mid lane, consider placing a ward at their wraiths if you can to prevent a counter gank from that side. Not only does it prevent a counter gank possibly but it also gives a \"safe side\" for your mid laner to stick to to be careful from ganks if they also place a ward in the river on that side.\n\nCommunicate with your support as to how you want to rotate your wards around the map as well, not just late game but early as well. Once you get into higher elos you may find supports roaming around the map and coming to gank mid or top lane. Use this to your advantage and create a two man gank squad on a lane and go with them into their jungle if you feel safe and get some deep wards down with your supports sightstone.\n\nOn some champions in the jungle you may even want to consider picking up a sightstone yourself. It may seem like a waste of 800 gold but once you get wards down it can be extremely useful for your team bot late and early. This is even more effective if you look for time to counter jungle. You get to deny the enemy jungler creeps and you get deep wards in their jungle, its a win win!\n\n**Keep your champion short and sweet, like a cupcake**\n\nWhy I say this is that when you focus on only playing 1-3 champions in a role you will find that when you play them constantly you don't really need to think about how to play the champion itself anymore and you get put in an \"auto-pilot\" sort of state. Once in this state you can use this brain power that you were using previously to focus on your mechanics and improving your game knowledge. I know it can be boring to play only one to three champions per roll, but once you do it for long enough you will defs see results!\n\n**Consider starting a ranked journal**\n\nA ranked journal I think is a very good idea if you plan to go up in elo. After every game write down at least one thing that you did wrong from the said game. Then after around a week or you think you have played enough games, look back over it and see what your most common mistake from that time frame was. Once you figure out what that is, go into your next games for the week focusing on making sure that mistake doesn't happen mainly in your gameplay. Consider having a sticky note either using a physical sticky note or using the sticky note program on windows (or equivalent on other operating systems) to write down what this mistake was so that you get reminded of it every time that you go into game.\n\n**Final notes**\n\nAll in all I think your doing a great job so far, keep going and keep your head high and you'll see results in no time!\n\nIf you have any questions or need clarification on anything I have said let me know!\n\nHope you learned something!\n\n- Elam","replies":[{"poster":"I Kokichi I","date":"2016-04-03T08:45:17.939+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just happy a pro replied haha :3\n\nSeriously though. Thanks for the tips, I will definitely take what you have said on-board. I have always had in the back of my mind \"I'm not warding enough\" or \"I should get green smite or a sightstone\" but never really took action on it, always thought that good old classic \"My team won't use the information anyways\" Which isn't right. I think that point you made there is hopefully a bit of a wake-up call to ward a bit more and not just rely on the team for that. Communication is a big one. I don't talk in chat much but I tend to ping a fair amount, probably would make a difference to speak about objectives, I always sort of expect my team to know when we should be doing an objective, when perhaps I should be forcing the tower push or the dragon call and such. In regards to the journal I started one a few weeks back but only did it for a few days, I will trust your word that it is indeed actually beneficial and be more consistent with it. \n\nI will see ya in dynamic queue one day ;)\nThanks again for the advice.","replies":[{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-04-03T09:59:55.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Never get a sight stone on a jungler. NEVER. Get a tracker knife. Tracker gives you two wards. Then you upgrade your trinket to a blue ward for the extra range and to dump from a range on dragon if needed.\n\nAnyone who tells you to get a sight stone on a jungler is a sure thing noob.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2016-04-04T03:03:19.111+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that sightstone can be a situational pickup. Going it gives you more variety when choosing what smite you want to use. On top of this you get 4 wards at a time instead of 2. Its really play style based. Sometimes on certain champions you go the sightstone because you need the vision along with something like the blue or red smite.\n\nPlus along with this blue trinket wards can easily be picked off and they are un-targetable if you want to do something like jump to them with Lee Sin Jungle. A great example of this is having 4 wards instead of 2, you aren't locked into using them for just ward jumps or using them for vision, you can use a combo of two for each, or go all out on outplays or vision for your team. If you are behind you could go ward up the areas around your base with 4 wards at once, back have all 4 wards ready for a team fight when you need them to make an outplay ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-04-05T00:20:52.209+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"No. \n\nIf you were a real diamond/master jungler you would never get sight stone. \n\nIt takes a slot for something more useful. Sightstone is only good on supports and yeah that sounds like i am generalizing that role to only need it, but it is true certainly when now us Junglers have tracking knife for sight.\n\nTracking knife is better and should be one of your main jungle items anyway, if you plan on invading/farming their side of the jungle or stopping them farming your jungle, get tracker. Sight stone might give you a little bit of health but overall helps you not one bit in your build and i can't for the life of me think of ANY jungler who would benefit from a sightstone.\n\nSure you get 4 instead of 2 wards from the tracker, but every time you go back to base they come back. Also if you plan on using tracker and being agressive, a blue trinket is what you want. So you will have 2 normal wards and 1 long range spotting wards which works superbly on champions like rengar or shaco who use the bushes as their initiate. \n\nThe other smites are good yes. But not as needed as tracker is in higher ELO. As in high ELO sight wins you games. So tracker is way better than a small slow and a tiny amount of damage, or the decrease damage from one target. \n\nTracker always over sightstone. And unless you can point me to some very high level players using sightstone in jungle i won't budge on this ever. And i should know it isn't used as it is my second highest role and never in my entire 6k games played over my 2 high level accounts have i ever seen a jungle get sightstone. In bronze and silver i have.. but not in high ELO.","replies":[{"poster":"jimuskin","date":"2016-04-06T16:35:48.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"When the bronze is telling off the master ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-04-06T17:25:07.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"when somebody criticises the bronze making fair, if not extremely valid points against it-doesnt-matter-who-because-they're-great-points -.- when that somebody hasnt contributed to anything but knows to point out the obvious to make himself feel better for not having a better contribution than he ever possibly could over either of these people in a million years so all he can do is childishly make fun of the absolute most obvious thing he can make fun of and think he can get away with it like twitch chat -.- when the bronze is so obviously a smurf or watches a lot of pro games and/or is intelligent enough to know what hes talking about and make valid reasons as to why he thinks a certain way, and that cant be totally dismissed -_-","replies":[{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-04-08T08:53:09.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Upvoting for truth. \n\nAs i said to him this is my fun account and also my ADC account =).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-04-08T08:52:21.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I post this on my fun account.

(seriously if you see them take your jungle, get the tracker blade. More wards the better.\n\n**3.** Know when to trade and when to farm. To explain this, if you see your team poking in mid, but they aren't planing on engaging. There is no point you being there. Push another lane or farm some of their jungle or yours. Most junglers have zero poke so at the poke phase of team fights you are just dead weight standing there picking your nose. Farm jungle but be close enough for cleaning up or dashing to the fight.\n\n**4.** Late game don't waste flash for a possible kills unless the enemy team isn't there AKA the enemy you are chasing is solo. This can screw over disengaging a team fight, and as most junglers have a dash/blink to get into a fight, save the flash for getting out.\n\n**5.** Don't stick to a set item path at all times. So many times i see a jungler play hard into their build for something like DPS, but need some MR or armor/health. But they just keep building dps and die instantly in the fight because they are the focus. Some times you think \"at least they focused me and wasted abilities\" but this isn't always the case. Having the jungler dead means no trades on jungle objectives, meaning you are dead, they have free kill on dragon or baron. YOU SHOULD BE ALIVE TILL THE END OF FIGHT. Unless you are a super tanky jungler then it is okay if you die early it is your job unless you died solo v 4-5.\n\n**6.** Watch the map. Seriously i know people say this for all roles and yeah of course it is what everyone should do. But what YOU need to be doing once you are at a sustain level in jungle is watching others fights and the map in general. Watch them fight while you auto the mobs. See what is going on and how they play. Just looking at the mini-map isn't enough to know if it is possible to attack/gank a lane. If you see the way your ally positions them self, you can alter your pattern of ganking to be more effective. Take a dash jungler for example. And bot lane is being hard pushed on purple side. You don't enter from the river. You enter from behind the tower. Why? Because they will be hard focusing on the river for a gank from you. They won't see you from the tower most the time. Same for other lanes. How you approach due to what you see on the map really helps. \n\n**7.** Play for you. Seriously i put this last because it is the most important. Sure people will ask or complain about no gank, just ignore them. Don't fuel their fire. Most the time they wont keep going unless you are about to JUST lose. You know what though? They can't report you for not helping them. It isn't how the reporting works. If you think ganking that lane won't be profitable, then don't gank it. Your best bet is to ping retreat to the lane if they ask for assistance, it will make them back or backoff and not want to mouth off because they were warned not to play so silly.","replies":[{"poster":"I Kokichi I","date":"2016-04-03T08:46:34.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks man, I appreciate the tips.
