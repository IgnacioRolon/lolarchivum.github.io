After being attacked by Sogret, the mark will do bonus magic and 5% of their missing HP. Activating a mark will lower your cool downs.\n\n**Q - [Keep Them Quiet]** Sogret targets an ally and then jumps onto them. Sogret latches on until the ability is recasted. Recasting your Q will allow you jump to a targeted location. Sogret will then be silenced for a short duration. Once Sogret lands at the targeted location, an AoE silence is unleashed after a short delay which deals magic and physical damage. Enemies located in the AoE are silenced for a short duration.\n\n**W - [Cruel Penalty]** Passive: Broken Trust will now inflict a slow on an enemy target by 20% and 10% of your movement speed. Active: All nearby targets marked by Broken Trust will be dealt magic damage, physical damage and have their armor and magic resist reduced for a few seconds. Damaging a target recently affected by Cruel Penalty will give you bonus physical damage for a short amount time.\n\n**E - [Shush]** Sogret shushes in a line dealing magic damage and physical damage. Each champion hit will increase the thickness and range of Disgusted while being casted. After the full cast Sogret will jump backwards, gaining movement speed.\n\n**R - [Represser]** Sogret trows out a whip of blades in a cone. Once the blades reach their maximum range, the Sogret pulls the blades back towards herself along with any enemies hit. Any enemies hit will be dealt magic and physical damage. Targets above 50% health will be given a bleed debuff that will deal damage per second. The bleed debuff deals a total of 10% of their maximum health with physical damage.\n\n**How To Play:** Sogret is a mid lane squishy melee hybrid assassin who is strongest at team-fights. She is  designed to wander and to be almost defenseless alone. If the enemy has warded well they can catch her out hiding in the brush or safely retreat before she can attack. Sogret’s main combo is to use Q on an ally and ult towards enemies before she lands onto her ally. This way her ult has been casted, while keeping enemies in range for her Q's second cast. Once Sogret has recasted her Q for a second time, she will have time to use her W. After your W has been casted, it would now be a great opportunity to use Disgusted, your E. Because your targets should be clumped and close together , it should be quite easy to hit them all with Disgusted. Then continue to auto-attack your targets if they haven’t already been killed. While playing Sogret, you need to be able to pay attention to the map in order to make sure you know where the enemy jungler so you know when it is the right time to help bot lane.This is one of the most important things to keep in mind because you are unable to activate your Q when there are no nearby allies. Top is another easy place to wander as long as you know it’s safe. Sogret is extremely strong in team fight compositions with large amounts of crowd control. As a final note, you must play Sogret safe early game because she has no form of poke other than her E, which can be seen coming and can be easily dodged. It doesn’t help that her early game mana costs and her cooldowns are very high.\n\n**Sogret’s Build:** Because Sogret has both AD and AP scalings in her kit, her builds can be very versatile. You would want to mostly build offensive items that provide mobility. Additionally, you might want to buy at least one defensive item to prevent your snowball from melting out of control(pun intended).\n\n**[Synergy]** \n\n{{champion:61}} \nWhen combining both of their AoE abilities, you can completely demolish team fights. Also, Orianna is a great pick on a team with Sogret because she can keep you safe with her ball as you snowball out of control. With her shield on you, she can activate her slow to keep enemies in range for the second part of Sogret's Q.\n\n{{champion:32}} \n With Amumu's strong early game ganks, he can prevent Sogret from falling before late game comes. When Amumu uses his ultimate, Sogret can quickly jump onto him and off again to activate her silence on enemies and deal massive damage.\n\nStat          | lvl 1 | per lvl | lvl 18 |\nHealth      | 510 | +79    | 1853  |\nAttack D.  | 59   | +5      | 144    |\nHealth R.  | 1.2  | +0.25 | 5.45  | \nAttack Sp.| .599|+4%    |... math is complicated... its probably a #|\nMana        | 390 | +45    | 1155 |\nArmour     |   22 | + 3.9  | 88.3 |\nMR            |   20 | +4.1   |89.7  |\nRange       | 150                         | \nMovement Speed|    342         |\n\n\nLore is being worked on.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Aeonne","date":"2016-01-15T05:40:29.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see her E working, seeing how she screams and is the Keeper of Silence.\n\nAlso, the whole thing is set out and worded pretty poorly, try editing it and maybe people will come commenting.\nMake a lore.\n\nAlso, you should do a little set out like this (At the start);\nName:\nTitle:\nWeapon:\nSiblings:\nFaction:\nRole:\nLane:\nGender:\n\nBase Stats:\n1: / 18:\nHealth = (#) / Health = (#)\nAttack Damage = (#) / Attack Damage = (#)\nHealth Regeneration = (#) / Health Regeneration = (#)\nAttack Speed = (#) / Attack Speed = (#)\nMana = (#) / Mana = (#)\nArmour = (#) / Armour = (#)\nMana Regeneration = (#) / Mana Regeneration = (#)\nMagic Resist = (#) / Magic Resist = (#)\nRange = (#) / Range = (#)\nMovement Speed = (#) / Movement Speed = (#)","replies":[{"poster":"Nature Druid","date":"2016-01-16T04:19:19.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not gonna lie, I typed this while taking a dump but my friend helped me reword it. Hopefully its possible to read now. I'll try to put in more stats and how much she scales as I do more research on how much is too much and how little is too little. Overall I want to make her a champion who can start a fight and leave as quickly as possible without being slaughtered immediately. I also want to make sure that she is very squishy with good damage with utility similar to Ahri. The difference would be that Sogret would have to go deeper into a fight while Ahri would have a slightly safer play style. I do agree that her E doesn't really work in her kit i was looking for a final ability to add to her kit because I was running out of battery and I was trying to finish my dump in peace XD. Thanks for the suggestion, I'll take them into account when I continue working on Sogret.","replies":[{"poster":"Aeonne","date":"2016-01-16T04:57:59.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Nature Druid","date":"2016-01-16T05:34:32.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks bro, I really appreciate it XD {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Reclaimer","date":"2016-01-15T08:19:38.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Overall its an interesting idea however, you might want to rethink your passive and Q ability atm. The passive is very similar to zeds, and the Q is more or less a silence ability. Riot removed all silence's from assassins a while back as there is no counter play and is  in their words \"anti fun\", kinda like tahms devour, cool idea, very anti fun, kinda like a few of the new abilities on the new champs/reworks. Your w and e seem pretty cool but, your R is hard to understand and confusing, might want to try rewording that. Keep working on it!","replies":[{"poster":"Nature Druid","date":"2016-01-16T04:10:30.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really love your suggestions and I'll take them into consideration when i continue to edit this champion. I did reword the ultimate with the help of a friend and we also fixed the horrendous grammar. I was thinking about how most silences were removed from assassins and I honestly only gave a silence for synergy with her passive. I was originally going to type that the silence would last for a short duration but I typed that the silence would last for a second long and even I know that's insane XD. I'm still working on balance and trying to make this idea as fun as possible. I also feel her W is slightly to strong right now and I'm not sure if I'm going to nerf the ability or let it be for now. Thanks for the support, I really appreciated it.","replies":[]}]}]}
