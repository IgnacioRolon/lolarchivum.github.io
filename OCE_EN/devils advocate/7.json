Is that through getting a champ shard and making it permanent or is that just to acquire a champ? \r\n\r\njust clarification as im starting to wonder if its worth getting a champ shard upgraded to perm if i already own it so the T6/T7 boost isnt so expensive with blue essence.\r\n\r\nLets say at present i have 3 champs on mastery 4/5 that im considering focusing on, i spend some IP for a champ shard mystery token, if that token is a champ  i want to level, and i upgrade it? Does it become a perm shard? \r\n\r\nLittle unlear on this process because at present, the 1700ip thing, without Riot meaning too, has made the cheapest easiest ways to improve your champ pool and farm blue essence for upgrading mastery levels. generally i get around 1700 within a 1 day gaming session non-boosted. Sometimes only 1200 or so, but quickly the next day of playing i get the missing 500, from that, ive gather a rather large blue essence pool for free, i am now ready to start buying those 6300ip champs with a shard and essence upgrade for 1/4th the price and all whilst disenchanting champs to get my mastery up anyways, combine this with the shop discounts which only offer skins on champs you own, if you stop buying champs you dont really want to play just to complete... I get a small list of champs with skin discounts... I&#039;ve effectively stopped buying RP for champ discounts through store, i no longer have to wait for a special for a 6300ip champ to buy for 487rp, i no longer care about chests/keys that much because of Mystery Champ Shards with IP, and i wont ever buy a skin through store, because my personal shop will have all the champs i want to play, with a discount every 3 weeks on random skin selection including legacy i believe... So.... Sidetrack rant\r\n\r\nRiot, people will half a brain will realize you dont need to spend $20 a fortnight to keep up with things, you can do it on $5 a month to get some keys to unlock ur chests, spend ur IP on shards, get your champion pool skins on personal discounts... You in an effort to appease the community who dont spend money, have really created a path that could potentially lose you a large portion of revenue (hell, maybe up to 1/3rd - 1/2 i think) if every account starts doing things this way...\r\n\r\nMake an alt, only buy 5 champs you&#039;re always gunna play, always have them on discount for skins, upgrade all with shard loot.... \r\n\r\nanyways...\r\n\r\nclarify, how do we acquire champ shard permanents?","replies":[{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-06-18T06:51:15.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"which in essence is roughly 600+ blue essence gtd anyways so not worth the risk","replies":[]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-06-17T23:54:26.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nSorry for the late reply.\n\n>clarify, how do we acquire champ shard permanents?\n\nBy re-rolling 3 champion shards you will obtain a random champion permanent.","replies":[]}]}
