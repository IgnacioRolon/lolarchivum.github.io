(repost for lazy people)","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like many of you, i logged in yesterday to be filled with joy at the release of Hextech Crafting / Loot systems only to find i had never ending issues trying to open my chest or access the Hextech crafting / loot tab! After 28h of issues, no reply from ticketing Riot i decided to do my own research and go through multiple forums and potential issues. Here&#039;s what i found to fix my issues.\r\n\r\nAdobe Air! For alot of you whom have bought a laptop in the last 10months or so with Windows 10, you may be shocked to realize. Your system may still run LoL, but it is a game which uses adobe air support. Be sure you have this installed on your system!\r\n\r\nAdobe Air Link: https://get.adobe.com/air/\r\n\r\nInternet Settings: You may or may not have this already done, when i compared i found my settings didn&#039;t match Riots request of how it should be set up... Do the following\r\n\r\nControl Panel &gt; Internet Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Scroll down to security &gt; Be sure that these two boxes are checked! &quot;Use SSL 3.0 and TSL 1.0&quot;\r\n\r\nAs a windows 10 user, i double checked to make sure my service pack was up to date (it was!)\r\n\r\nThese are the 3 issues i found where my system didn&#039;t match Riots recommendations. Once i changed these, i have received my Hextech Chest and loot, opened and received my skin (Heartseeker{{champion:22}}   )\r\n\r\nNow get back into your games once you&#039;ve made sure these settings and adobe air is installed have been done and enjoy your Hextech release!\r\n\r\nHappy games ahead community!\r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}} {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[]}
