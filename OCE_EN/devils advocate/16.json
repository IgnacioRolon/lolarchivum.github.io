Now we&#039;re getting elemental lux as an ultimate...\n\nmy prediction is.... with the rework of assassins, we&#039;ll see a bunch of new 1350+ skins released to tickle peoples fancy whilst playing the assassin craze to death till its rebalanced whilst things like &quot;Taunt mechanics&quot; and what you can do with concept of &quot;tanks/taunters&quot; abilities in game (shen and rammus are still forgotten champs, Shen&#039;s not really even played period outside of aram by choice due to the lack of Q poke and him being energy starved all the time if he doesnt hit something) im sure some link to stats will try to prove me wrong, but to the day to day solid player that likes a hard fun game not a casual steam roll.. no sir, we don&#039;t see them. Fakers trying to bring back galio so we&#039;ll see him poorly played till he&#039;s forgotten and Faker realizes (probably already does) on a world competitive level Galio at present doesnt work with his huge CD to his ulti that if it doesn&#039;t land/gain a kill or two for team.... you&#039;re near useless other than some mild support which again, on top pro level, is ignorable at present. \n\nSo, we&#039;re likely to see a bunch more assassin skins over the next couple of months\n\nwhilst champs like Jhin only have 1, Swain has 3 whilst annie has 8 and a hextech legendary..... \n\nhandy info found to save time.... and relates to this annoying craze Riot has with just releasing popular champs with skins for cash not just to spread out the creative love across all champs...\n\nBefore i show you the list here are the 20 champions with the most skins:\nThese include &quot;traditional skins and free skins acquired through non-rp means&quot;\nAnnie: 9 \nGragas: 9\nJax: 9\nRyze: 9\nTwisted Fate: 9\nAlistar: 8\nAmumu: 8\nBlitzcrank: 8\nDr. Mundo: 8\nEzreal: 8\nFiddlesticks: 8\nKatarina: 8\nKog&#039;Maw: 8\nMiss Fortune: 8\nNidalee: 8\nSivir: 8\nTeemo: 8\nTryndamere: 8\nVeigar: 8\nWarwick: 8\n\nAnd here are the 15 champions with the least amount of skins:\nIllaoi: 1\nJhin: 1\nKindred: 1\nTahm Kench: 2\nAzir: 2\nBard: 2\nDiana: 2\nKalista: 2\nKha&#039;Zix: 2 \nLissandra: 2\nRek&#039;Sai: 2\nVel&#039;Koz: 2\nYorick: 2\n\nIm sure thats not 110% accurate to date now however... \n\nIt gives a general idea....\n\nNow on top of that, instead of actually creating new content for champs that need it\n\nlets just RELEASE CHROMA PACKS FOR POPULAR CHAMPS TO COLLECT LOOSE 250RP \n\ncmon RIOT....\n\nyour decision process is steadily declining to the point, i really question how much further as a company you can manage to go on your own before the community just abandons ship. Sooner or later some Korean company will just release its own MOBA and take its countries market back away from you.\n\n\nRiot... Have you noticed one of the biggest franchises in modern gaming is close to losing its community already and may have to fold because a lack of preordering? \n\nDon't be like Activision thinking you can milk your players forever. \n\nCoD is dying, you can die too. Moba as a genre will stick, people will just remake the engine and reskin, rename the champions ranging from Dota 1, HoN, LoL and Dota 2 for that \"familiar feel\" and give the gaming community what they want and just just laugh their asses off.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-11-27T21:27:45.184+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Star Guardian Lux was already a skin, it only went on sale because more star guardian skins came out _(like how existing arcade skins went on sale when the new ones came out)_\n\nShen is played a fair bit _(he is my main top laner along with Yorick)_ and he's pretty powerful.\n\nYou say that Galio isnt very good, yet he had the highest win rate of any champion this year.\n\nYou missed both Taliyah and Aurelion Sol in the 'only 1 skin' list \nwhile Azir/Kench/Bard/Kalista/Kha have 3 skins each\n\nYou say \"Dont give the assassins skins, give Jhin a skin!\"\nJhin IS an assassin (just check his secondary) \n\nPlus Jhin was only released this year, you can hardly complain about a champ not getting a new skin on the same year as his release _(plus he is almost certainly going to get an SKT skin anyway.)_\n\nWhile I agree that some champions are forgotten in terms of skins (Yorick has NEVER had a new skin, while Ezreal gets a new one every year.)\nIts hardly a reason for RIOT to lose their player base and \"Die\"\n\nThere are reasons for champions like Lux getting the ultimate skin, it is because the ultimate skins go to 'simple' champs, in an attempt to spice up their gameplay.\n\nEzreal/Udyr/Sona/Lux are all boring AF champions, so giving them an evolving skin helps them feel like more of a complex and exciting champion. There would be no point giving Azir or Kalista an ultimate skin (even though I desperately want both of them!) because you basically cant get more interesting than those two, and an ultimate skin for them might just make them feel too complicated and messy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-11-27T21:54:00.454+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay so did you take any time while forming your lists and rants to look up some stuff on the champs you're complaining about either having too many skins or not enough?\n\nYorick for years was said that he wont be getting any new skins until after his rework, when his rework was being released Riot promised we wont have to wait as long as Sion for Yorick's first post rework skin. So Yorick's getting a new skin soon, but why would you care you more than likely have never played Yorick like 99% of the LoL community.\n\nLissandra in recent memory has received two skins, while true she has very few compared to other champs, that means she's going to be on the back list for sometime give or take variables.\n\nDiana being my main I have no problem with her lack of skins, even if she gets a new one I'll probably just stick to Lunar Goddess, kinda hard for any new skin to top that (just like when I play Sivir I always use PAX Sivir despite having all her skins). Though it is quite notable that she just got Infernal Diana, giving her three skins and making your list of bitching wrong again.\n\nI could go on over how your bitching is stupid and your list is wrong, but I think you get the point now... maybe though I doubt you will.\n\nSkins are partially released based on popularity (because they have to be, you can't release a skin for Urgot since only 2 people in the world will buy it, myself and dunno who else) time and how many skins a champ has gotten recently. NOT. HOW. MANY. THEY. HAVE. TOTAL.\nNotice that all the champs on your bitching list of having too many skins, were around since the game was created, meaning they were around when the game had a total of 20 champs and released like 10 skins a week. Of course they'll have a lot of skins.\n\nWhy are you complaining about the assassins that just got reworked getting new skins? For most of them it's about time that they received a new skin.\nDo you know how long it's been since Rengar's last skin (that counts, Team Skins from Worlds do not count in any way to a champ's skin counter/timeline) Nighthunter was so long ago.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nYou can bitch and moan about LoL disappearing as much as you want, but we all know that LoL is to MOBAs as WoW is to MMOs.\nHell it even follows the same formula of not being the first.\n\nAs much as I hate COD, what it represents and what it's done for the industry, it's not going to die.\nActivision is going to continue to beat that carcass well after it's faded into dust.\nMost likely scenario is that next year when we get the new Assassin's Creed, Activision will take notice of how the gap in new AC has improved AC's sales, and will probably take whatever COD is slated for release in 2018 off the counter and release it in 2019 and what was meant to be in 2019 will now be 2020 because Activision love their yearly releases too much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-11-28T03:41:36.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No one's forcing you to buy anything, Riot's making more skins for people who want them to buy.
