I get less traffic between, its only minimal, but even on csgo, i connect with 5ms and im using a jbhifi $500 laptop (potato in real gaming terms).\n\nI torret at up to 2.4mbs download and i can download directly off bnet at 6-7mb per sec. Valve, i find im around 2.2mb, it is server related obviously, those speeds aren't available with everything, but i find i consistantly get 1.9-2.2mb downloads across the board, my connection to gaming is fairly solid. I checked WoW on my old account on US servers to see and even thats sitting on 80-100ms. \n\nI haven't tried 20+ players in FPS for US/EU servers, i'd still say stick with OCE servers for playable connections. \n\nAnd.... \n\nDont use wifi, it may say its ok... you still lose some data connection,\n\nuse your ethernet cable as much as possible","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-05-02T12:58:39.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Bring back U.R.F.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKBCG_AKJqU)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-05-01T23:42:24.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you still not know the schedule....","replies":[{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-05-02T02:38:03.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Roguestoney,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=h1sEIaWH,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-05-01T23:42:24.085+0000)\n>\n> How do you still not know the schedule....\n\nmy first account was on NA just as OCE was released, quit a couple of years back but left it open for mates.
