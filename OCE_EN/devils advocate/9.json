But now im reduced to at worst 15-at best 70/80... on average around 25-40 (bounces).\n\nI&#039;ve tried googling options but the options that come up are for an outdated method which has changed, \ni run AMD graphics (AMD Radeon R3 w/e built in) amd quadcore 1.8ghz 4gb ram... \n\nNow we have &quot;radeon settings&quot; and a gaming tab, i&#039;ve tried to match it as best i can to garenalol and doing customs also to fiddle with ingame settings,\n\nis there anything else i can do also? another settings page within league and custom turn off some graphics if required to reduce stress? \n\nIt&#039;s not internet related, i play every game on around 15ms at worst 21ms without a random spike from ISP.\n\nalso; there used to be an fps counter on screen and now there's not?!?! \n\nI just wanna start doing ranked games and i don&#039;t want to risk it {{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-08T02:03:42.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nTry running through the [Low FPS troubleshooting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-troubleshooting) support article, let me know if anything there helps out.","replies":[{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-04-08T22:07:27.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"doing a CC clean at present, i was following that already and fixed a fair few issues already in game, last 3-4 have been fairly stable and consistant with fps. Also seems autoupdated drivers, werent autoupdating, was 4 versions behind. Registry had a fair bit of clutter to it, going through a scan now for the cleaner and let it process then trying another game out, however arams were running this morning at 60fps with the odd drop down to 50ish","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-09T08:40:32.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad the issue is resolved.\n\nSee you on the rift,\nSeph","replies":[]}]}]}]}
