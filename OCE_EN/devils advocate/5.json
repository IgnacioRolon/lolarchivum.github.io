Was looking at the mechanics, i figured they just added a couple of 00's to the algorithms to make the 80% CDR viable in the game system which may have impacted the way experience was gathered etc and represented the level you'd have gained should you be able to go past 18.\n\nThe URF thing is what confused me.\n\nThanks for clarifying, i guess this issue won't come up for another year!","replies":[]}]}]}
