You have to do a silly dance with Hex Tech Crafting as well.\n\nThis makes little sense. That payer has earned S/S+ rank 3 times, and they still can't unlock their level 7 mastery?\n\nWhat if you don't own all the champs? Does that mean they have to wait for the RNG of Hex Tech to give them the right champion shards?\n\nThat means they have to spam other champs to get chests, when all they want is to unlock the mastery they deserve for one champ.\n\nWhat if all they play is Xin? They have to wait till next season to get another chest, which is not guaranteed to give them the right shard?\n\nThis new mastery system is badly broken because it is tied to Hex Tech. Let players earn the rewards they want. if they want chests, let them earn them by playing well across a range of champs. If they want the mastery, let them earn it without having to jump through hoops.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-05-25T06:31:58.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nWe always planned to offer an alternative but wanted to get the feature out to players as soon as possible.\n\nBecause loot has some RNG elements to finding champ shards and permanents, we’re working on a way to pick up only champ shards for IP/RP.
