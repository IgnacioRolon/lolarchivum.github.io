I know i own him, i also know i own Marauder skin for him and no other, but due to hextech etc... I wouldnt have a clue if i bought it on sale or i rerolled into it etc. \n\nI know there&#039;s a list of purchases etc in the account tab, but just straight up... \n\nwhy can&#039;t we see entirely with ease, what we  own in our profiles? \n\nHextech has it nicely laid out, surely you could clean this section up also so we can view it with a concise easy informed manner!?\n\nWhy do we have to select the store to see what skins we own at once? \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-11-28T19:07:53.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah im similar ive got about 10 skins ive got nfi how ive got, including omega teemo, i d/e'd my first one through hextech apparently i got it on a reroll of skins however","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2016-11-28T05:05:40.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i forget who i have skins for all the time, and it just feels like i wasted money on it, i would be great to be able to see a list of owned skins in the client","replies":[]}]}
