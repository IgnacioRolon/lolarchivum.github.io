My idea is pretty much the opposite so when you're in locked screen you can hold space and it unlocks your screen while you hold space bar, personally i thought this was a great idea as someone who plays on a locked screen, y'all might think otherwise but this is my idea. Oh and it would be a setting in the esc menu so if people dont like it they can easily disable it. :D\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, is there an actual way of like sending this into Riot?","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-11-27T04:23:23.424+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be good if they gave us that option in the controls.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arks","date":"2014-11-27T05:40:16.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"playing with locked camera is just crippling yourself, learn to use space bar and free camera.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geldour","date":"2014-11-27T04:14:58.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i use wasd to move camera around","replies":[]}]}
