They will possibly ask you to prove ownership (by asking a whole bunch of questions about the creation of the account) so that the account can be properly secured.\n\nYou aren't in the wrong at all for wanting to recover *your* account. The person who stole the account and the person who bought it are the ones at fault here, regardless of how much time/effort/money the buyer put into the account.","replies":[{"poster":"nedyoyo11","date":"2019-11-02T14:26:49.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much I have already changed the password to the league account and ill be sure to change the password for my gmail being used and get a better virus scan and to contact support.\n\nThank you so much for the help and advice","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-11-03T00:46:13.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd recommend you also check out the website https://haveibeenpwned.com/ as it is a great resource to identify when your accounts have been compromised, and can help you identify if this case is more widespread than a single account (in this case being LoL). It may also be prudent for you to check the security of any important accounts you have (such as emails, banks etc.), it's better to be safe than sorry.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
