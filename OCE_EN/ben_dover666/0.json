Given the information you have provided, there are 3 possibilities I would consider the most likely.\n\n1. This was a cumulative punishment. That is, one that is the result of a long and consistent but not so severe negative history. These kinds of punishments aren't all that well served by reform cards, but player support can provide you with more context.\n2. There is pre/post-game chat that was not included in the reform card. Including pre and post-game chat in the reform cards is a relatively recent addition, and while they are triggering punishment correctly where appropriate, I gather there is still the occasional hiccup which may cause it to be incorrectly excluded from the reform cards. If there was relevant pre/post-game, player support can provide it to you.\n3. It's a false positive. I'd say this is the least likely of the three, since false positives in general are more than a little rare, but they do still happen from time to time. Again, the process is to follow through with player support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sternplatin","date":"2020-01-01T06:54:49.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"got a 25 game chat restriction and honor level 0 last year at nearly the end of the season, so I didnt get any honor level 5 rewards.\nI typed \"fucking toxic flamers\" because the whole team harassed and insulted me &amp; my family the whole time.
