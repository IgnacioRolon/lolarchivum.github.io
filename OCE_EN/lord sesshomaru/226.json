Now i ask you where is the counterplay there?\r\nmid teamfight she can just press R and hit everyone, she doesn&#039;t even need to get back out of the fighting to do it.\r\nsurely if you see her start her ult animation and you have a stun etc etc, you should be able to stop her.\r\n\r\nimagine if you couldnt stop Karthus from ulting, if as soon as he pressed R no matter what, it would hit you, that would be utter bs. as it is, if you want to land your ult as karthus you need to either \r\n\r\n1. Move out of the battle (wayyy out) \r\n\r\n2. Die\r\n\r\nLux doesn&#039;t need to do either, she just presses R whenever the mood suits knowing that no matter what happens (unless 100% of her health disappears in under 0.5 seconds) she will fire her ult.\r\n\r\nNow this situation really rustles my jimmies: She was in the cast animation for her ult (and the little red line had only just appeared) when our bard&#039;s ult hit her in an attempt to save a team mate, and not kidding (while all Zhonya&#039;s golden) her ult STILL fired.\r\n\r\nif you are going to make her ult invulnerable, then do so to Karthus&#039; and Kat&#039;s and Fiddle&#039;s and Xerath&#039;s etc. as well.\r\nkeep the rules the same for everyone.\r\n\r\ngive her some counterplay. seriously.","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-02-29T06:58:24.025+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"She can't do anything whilst ulting.\n\nCounterplay there.","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-02-29T07:00:26.601+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"It should be easy to dodge,\n\nyou should always keep your distance from {{champion:99}} as she is 100% skill-shot based.\n\nNot sure what you're doing wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-02-29T07:17:33.010+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I never said i was doing anything wrong?\nwhere in my post does it mention that i was ever even it by it?\n\nalso if its sooooo easy to counter her, how come she has a 53.1% win rate?\nif her kit was soooo easy to dodge, how come only 46.9% of the population can win against her?\n\nplease think these things through... jesus.","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-02-29T08:54:36.234+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lux's ult is not a channeled ability.\n\nIf it was to be interrupted she would be very unstable.\n\nAnd also ~~if you really used 3 accounts to down vote me and upvote yours it's pretty sad.~~ IF.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-02-29T10:34:27.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shens dash isn't a channelled ability, yet it is canceled when cc'd why should lux be any different\n\nand lol you seriously think i would do that? xD don't think you're so important.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-02-29T11:17:15.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why are you using Shen's Dash as the go to point for lux's ult?\n\nBut really it's mainly because she would have too much counterplay if it worked like that, Get snared, E'd Ult'd, oh no wait you used CC and interrupted her ult to live.\n\nEDIT: As a note, if you want her ult to be interruptible, you have to live with her Q being a multi stun.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-02-29T16:40:53.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because its the first ability that popped to my mind that isn't a channeled ability that can be interrupted.\n\nshe wouldnt have that much more counterplay, it just means she needs to leave a fight in order to ult, just like other mages like karthus and xerath, or champs like Jhin and the likes.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-03-01T04:56:02.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But Lux's ult isn't meant for artillery, or else it wouldn't proc her passive.","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-03-01T07:17:02.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=mtYyVPLe,comment-id=00000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-03-01T04:56:02.189+0000)\n>\n> But Lux's ult isn't meant for artillery, or else it wouldn't proc her passive.\n\n^","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Firebolt","date":"2016-02-29T12:25:39.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=mtYyVPLe,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2016-02-29T07:17:33.010+0000)\n>\n> I never said i was doing anything wrong?\n> where in my post does it mention that i was ever even it by it?\n> \n> also if its sooooo easy to counter her, how come she has a 53.1% win rate?\n> if her kit was soooo easy to dodge, how come only 46.9% of the population can win against her?\n> \n> please think these things through... jesus.\n\nBecause only people good at Lux play Lux at level 30+. I know it sounds stupid, but in the last few months, every Lux I've faced has just wrecked everyone because she knew how to land her abilities. Using Lux's win rate to come to the conclusion that she is strong is like looking at Lee Sin's win rate and coming to the conclusion that he is weak. It doesn't make sense, as both champs rely strongly on your ability to play them to make them strong or weak.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-02-29T12:33:36.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'd be right, except her Play rate is 23.7%\n\nhttp://www.lolking.net/champions","replies":[{"poster":"Firebolt","date":"2016-03-01T11:56:49.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=mtYyVPLe,comment-id=00000000000000010000,timestamp=2016-02-29T12:33:36.670+0000)\n>\n> You'd be right, except her Play rate is 23.7%\n> \n> http://www.lolking.net/champions\n\nYou gotta remember heaps of newbies pick her up too.
