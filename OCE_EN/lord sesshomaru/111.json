So i really don&#039;t understand the need for change.\r\n\r\nThe lore is cool, its a cool story, and it hasn&#039;t changed too much from what it used to be. But it had made champ&#039;s lore a little contradictory to their play styles. For example:\r\n\r\nAzir:\r\nAzir&#039;s lore used to be about Grand Emperor&#039;s and commanding noble armies. Where now its all about slaves, harem girls, and friendship. He only rose to power because his brothers and father died, theres nothing Grand about his lore at all. \r\nYet in game all his quotes are Grand and his playstyle makes you feel like the noble armies of Shurima are at their emperor&#039;s fingertips. It doesn&#039;t feel at all like Slaves and friendship. \r\n\r\nNasus:\r\nNasus has always been about preserving knowledge and stuff but his main focus was his almighty station as an ascended and the rivalry with his brother. But now the lore is based so heavily around strategy and knowledge, he is a scholar who values knowledge and strategy over all.\r\nYet his his playstyle has nothing at all to do with knowledge and certainly NOTHING to do with strategy, you just AFK farm for 30 minutes then walk up to each champ 1 by 1 and cut them in half, not very strategic? Azir feels like a much more strategic champ than that, and his lore has noting at all to do with strategy. And theres a big focus in Nasus&#039; lore about when he is sickly and frail, yet that is so completely at odds with the in-game view of Nasus, he is one of the hardest motherfuckers in the game to kill, tanky as hell and HP basically magnetises to him from everyone else. He is far from the strategic sickly scholar that is perceived in his lore. \r\n\r\nXerath:\r\nXerath&#039;s old lore had much more of a focus on blasting magic and his whole omnipotent state of being. His new lore is all about scheming and plots and betrayal, None of which transfer into his playstyle, when you play Xerath, do you feel like someone who was a scheming traitorous slave? or do you feel like a fucking god? Also whats up with the magical sarcophagus? That was the 1 problem i had with his old lore too, The sarcophagus that is bound to him, is a huge part of his aesthetic, and his first ever lore tackled it much better, it took him centuries to break out of it, and even then it was still bonded to him. In his current lore, it was slapped on him and then BAM he broke free instantly, if it was so easy for him to break out, why in the thousands of years he was trapped underground with nothing to do, did he not take the time to remove all the other bits?","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-05-11T07:21:51.477+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I like the lore expansions as I will call it.

Even before that, when Nasus was a librarian and reneckton was the guardian for it.\n\nI riot keeps this up there gonna fuck up my favourite lore.","replies":[]}]}
