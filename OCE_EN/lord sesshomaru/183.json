In no way should they be able to 1v1 an ADC and out DPS them and still live with 80%+ health. There has been an ADC update and a mage update overhaul. So perhaps tanks are next? I'd like to see more tanks focussed purely on being in the way contributing to CC and just being hard to kill with little to no damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-05-06T22:56:19.538+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate the meta, too.
