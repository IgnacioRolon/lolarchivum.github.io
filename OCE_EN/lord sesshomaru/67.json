Our next class update is going to be for assassins - http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/Tnfw1WW6-next-class-update-the-assassins\n\nIt provides a lot of great insight into what we will be focusing on for assassins and their class. Below is a small excerpt.\n\n> \n> 1) Ensure Assassin gameplay is healthy\n> Playing against an Assassin can often feel very inevitable and hopeless, especially once they start their snowball. Giving opponents options and opportunities to outsmart or outmaneuver the Assassin is critical to the sustainability of the class in the long-term. On the flip side, this also allows us to give Assassins a bit more punch when they do succeed meaning that theyâ€™ll be able to dig themselves out of even more precarious situations than before when executed to their full potential.\n> \n> There are 2 critical problems to solve in this space:\n> \n> Assassin damage needs to not happen literally in the blink of an eye.\n> \n> Assassin damage needs some level of variance.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-07-08T07:21:34.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea i have read it and I'm glad that assassins are getting some attention, but tbh after seeing the mutated freak that Brand turned into, i have little faith for what the updates hold for Zed. \n\nIf they 'update' Zed the same way they 'updated' Brand, god help us all...\n\nIn any case, Zed's problem doesn't come from his damage, at least with his delayed ult, there is some chance to heal/shield or use Zhonya's or QSS (_oh wait nvm, ADC's only hope was removed, thats right_), its his ability to teleport away from the fight at any time (with no warning) whenever things get slightly rough for him.\n\nso unless you can CC him for 6 full seconds seconds, or burst him down before his finger can move to the R key, he is virtually guaranteed an escape. (unlike other assassins that have to choose between escaping or using that ability to secure the kill, like Fizz/LB)\n\nAnd a ton of his power comes from his 'too convenient' items, Serrated Dirk gives him really really early armour pen which puts mages who are rushing an already build inefficient Zhonya's at a bigger disadvantage, (while conveniently there is no AP equivalent to help said mages deal with his Maw of Malmortius) and unlike the mages that have to rush Zhonya's in lane, both Dirk and Maw are part of his natural build path. Not to mention most of his items give him movement speed making an already slippery champion virtually uncatchable.... And lest be honest, we all know that Duskblade is the most unnecessary item in the game.\n\na lot more needs to be considered than just his damage. (this is providing the Update team even plucks up the courage to change one of the most popular champions in the league.)\n\nI just cant see an effective way out, a way that keeps Zed feeling like a 'Ninja' (which is something he does fantastically atm!) while changing his items and escape, but still making him feel like the same champion. And also a way that doesn't piss of all the Zed mains out there.\n\nI am very willing to be proved wrong! and ill happily admit I'm wrong if it happens\n\nbut i also don't think ignoring the problem and just waiting till the 'big fix' later down the track is an appropriate solution either.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-07-08T01:32:51.757+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"buy armor.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-07-08T07:22:42.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i had 150ish (which isn't much) but when everyone else is AP theres only so much you can do.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-07-08T09:14:33.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=xL2WUq7L,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-07-08T07:22:42.955+0000)\n>\n> i had 150ish (which isn&#x27;t much) but when everyone else is AP theres only so much you can do.\n\nzz and ga work","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-07-08T09:33:20.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-07-08T02:24:45.165+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Man you bitch a lot, just quit","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-07-08T07:23:45.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing improves if you just ignore all the problems.\n\nThey didn't land on the moon by telling the astronaughts not to complain when something wasn't working as expected.","replies":[{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-07-09T04:47:00.502+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=xL2WUq7L,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-07-08T07:23:45.116+0000)\n>\n> Nothing improves if you just ignore all the problems.\n> \n> They didn&#x27;t land on the moon by telling the astronaughts not to complain when something wasn&#x27;t working as expected.\n\nThere's a difference between constructive criticism and bitching like a little girl","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-07-09T12:21:51.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yet the bitching little girls always get the new Ferrari from daddys wallet.\n\nI know who id rather be.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-07-08T02:34:18.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what we can see here, first of all we don't have much of an assassin meta. They are annoying, but the meta and problem we have right now is tanks. They can deal a lot of damage and because they don't take much, can fight almost anyone except tank shredders. That is ok, but the problem is they don't have kiting potential due to their CC or gapclosers.\n\nI'm guessing by the looks of it you were stacking HP this game, which is ok for some champions but there are so much better items to be investing in if an assassin troubles you. Iceborn + some armor items e.g Dead Man's, Sterak's Gage is good for stopping burst.\n\nBesides, assassins are getting reworked in the preseason anyway. Hopefully they can make them optimal to any team while keeping some weaknesses in their kits.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-07-08T07:26:35.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that tanks are the major strength atm, but assassins are making wayy too much of an impact in a meta were theoretically they really shouldn't be powerful at all (Tanks > Assassins) so that raises alarm bells (to me at a least)\n\nI was Zac who is a HP tank, so most of my items involved HP, but i didn't just ignore resistances either.\n\nI hold little faith in the assassin reworks tbh, if they do to Zed what they did to Brand... jesus..","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-07-08T07:39:32.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't get me started on Zed, he can 1v2 tower dive and get away with it.
