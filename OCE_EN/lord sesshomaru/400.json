More the hp the more you can withstand the damage from mages where as adc/assasins amour with little mix of hp can help you withstand their damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-23T06:41:02.671+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont know if he landed it on anyone else, but i do know the chain reaction, and i don't think thats what happened.\n\nHow fed he was doesnt matter, we were both full build. And having HP doesn't reduce the amount of damage done... But i had 3500+ if you wanted to know.\n\nIts not withstanding the damage thats the problem, its how much it is doing.\n\nImagine if i wasnt a tank with 4 MR items, imagine if i was an ADC or a mage. If 1020 damage was what it was doing to that much damage reduction, imagine what it would do to someone with any?","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-06-23T06:52:53.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it does %hp damage. explosion is ~~10%~~ 16% hp. each stack is 6% hp. its a stupid buff.\n\nAnd it scales 1% more hp for every 66 ap (1.5% for 100 ap). Considering normally around 600-800 ap, thats 9-12%. Wouldnt be surprising if he had a void staff, for 35% penetration (because unlike armorpen, it removes 35% resistance not 35% of mr, stupid crud), 145 mr is equal to about 55% resistance, so he is still doing 80% damage, lets say he only has 600 ap, thats 9% hp. 9+16+6=31% hp, 31% of 3500 is 1085 damage, 80% of 1085 is 868. Even so, he would have likely had more than 600 ap, doing more damage. And that's if he instantly applied the explosion, if he let the burn tick for at least 3 seconds between each application, would have been an extra (1.5%, for first strike, 3% for second strike) another 4.5% of your health. So his % hp damage would have been 35.5%, 35.5% of 3500 is 1232.5, and 80% of that is 994 damage. Also, if he had liandry's Torment (don't ask why, because I don't know, probably because both hp% based?) the damage from that would have been included with his passive number indexed log. meaning that Liandry's could have easily done that last 26 damage.\n\nAnd thats only with 600 ap, if he had more, it would have done more, had more pen than just a void staff, would have done more. Magic % penetration has always been stronger than armor % penetration. \n\n(btw... 1020 isn't 67% of 3500....)","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-23T07:39:33.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> (btw... 1020 isn&#x27;t 67% of 3500....)\n\nhttp://imgur.com/HkA7ZS6\n\nTell that to brand.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-06-23T08:44:35.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there you go. thresh is naturally unresistant to magic damage","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-23T09:06:56.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still had 4 magic resist items, a PASSIVE shouldn't do 1020 damage to someone with 4 MR items. it doesn't matter who i was.\n\nthats just common sense (most champions abilities never get to 1000, let alone their passive)","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-06-24T01:29:21.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how do you only have 145 mr with 4 mr items.\n\neven with lowest mr items.\n\nBase 30\n+\nLocket 65\n+\nMikeal 100\n+\nMerc Treads 125\n+\nAthene 150\n\nSo using the 4 lowest mr granting items, without runes and masteries its still 150 mr.\n\nSo something isn't adding up","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kezzza","date":"2016-06-23T08:33:49.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=E60e0Kn8,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2016-06-23T06:52:53.426+0000)\n> (btw... 1020 isn&#x27;t 67% of 3500....)\n\nI believe that the 67% indicates how much of the damage done in that time was from that one ability, rather than the % out of your max hp, which I guess means he wasn't at full HP when he got blown up.\n\nThe damage is still pretty crazy though.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-06-23T08:46:35.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he wasn't full hp, i know, but OP made it out as he was, the 67% would have been from hp closer to 1800","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-23T09:05:39.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was full HP, i got hit by many things, one of which was brands passive that did 1020 damage.
