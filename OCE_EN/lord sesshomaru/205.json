So to stop this post being lost in a seething mass of people who wont even listen to it, I thought it was best to post it here and if it IS a bug then our riot guys can pass it on, its significantly more efficient, after all we have OCE boards for a reason. :)\r\n\r\nAnyway without further ado:\r\n\r\nAzir&#039;s W if used on a tower has no cooldown and can be double tapped on a tower for instant 2x damage,\r\ni havent seen anything in the patch notes about this being a thing (but i could have missed it) so I&#039;m assuming its a bug.\r\n\r\ni can provide images/video if requested :)\r\n\r\nAzir is my main and favourite champion in every way, i love playing him but if i beat my opponent i want to do it because of my actions (and Azir&#039;s) rather than exploiting a bug.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-18T02:35:07.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"not supposed to have cd when cast on towers.\n\nbut only idiots double cast it on a tower, you need to keep 1 for escape in case of ganks or something like that","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-11-18T03:04:01.511+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"when was that implemented? it hasn't been like that until recently.\n\nits situational of course.. if your in a group pushing a tower with limited time then you're perfectly fine to double tap it, or if it theres no more minions left and it needs one more to destroy it, but obviously if you're still in the laning phase and you don't have vision of the enemy jungler and or other laners then yea obviously you don't, thats just basic common sense...","replies":[{"poster":"Shashe","date":"2015-11-18T06:06:24.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=x3sI7f6d,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-11-18T03:04:01.511+0000)\n>\n> when was that implemented? it hasn't been like that until recently.\n> \n> its situational of course.. if your in a group pushing a tower with limited time then you're perfectly fine to double tap it, or if it theres no more minions left and it needs one more to destroy it, but obviously if you're still in the laning phase and you don't have vision of the enemy jungler and or other laners then yea obviously you don't, thats just basic common sense...\n\nYeah it's always been no cooldown on towers as far as i'm aware.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-11-18T07:53:12.317+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it definitely had a cooldown earlier this year and before, if it had no cooldown it would specifically mention it I'm sure.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-18T09:25:12.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"nope. never.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-11-18T21:27:35.795+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXWJ6GiMqQs\n\nas proof, watch the W icon go on cooldown, \ni know my champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-19T01:00:27.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"idc, it hasn't had one since like path 5.15, just drop it","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-11-19T08:47:46.274+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"nope. never.\"\n\"It hasn't had one since like path 5.15\"\n\nIf you're gunna make stuff up at least keep it consistent...\n\nthere was no change like that in 5.15, So if it hasn't had a cooldown since 5.15 then it is obviously a bug.

Read the ability description: Summoning the soldier on a turret will deal **damage to the turret** instead of **summoning a soldier**. Also, why do i know this? It is because once i hit the 300 AP mark, i use azir to tower seige and splitpush if we have a bad game and spam w's on towers with no cds.\n\nYou haven't been playing azir enough to not notice that.\n\nAlso -> https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/2o93co/advice_when_playing_azir/cml0zxn\n\nRead the last part of the post which says \"Don't spam W on tower - you need your soldier Hope that this helps you\".

Magic!\n\nsecondly, i never said you SHOULD spam both on a tower, i said you CAN. everyone knows not to waste your only escape.\n\nThirdly the tooltip does indeed say \"Will deal damage to the turret instead of summoning a soldier\" and amazingly it does that, it DOES deal damage to the tower and NOT spawn a sand solder, well done. \nbut tell me, where in that tooltip does it mention a reduced cooldown? it doesn't, so whats your point?\n\nLastly if you don't remember when he had a cooldown using it on towers, maybe its YOU who hasn't been playing him enough?\nbecause I've been playing him since he come out, and it certainly had one then.","replies":[]}]}]}
