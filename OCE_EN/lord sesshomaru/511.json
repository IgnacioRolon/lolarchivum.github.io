Very uneasy.\n\nThe death recap's whole purpose is to tell me where the damage comes from.  \nIf it doesn't know where it came from...  quite frankly I want a refund. I want that health back!\n\nWhat is this damage, and why is it unknown?\n\nAlso, why is Lee Sin's new voice over not included in the patch notes?\nI understand it'll be awkward for you to explain, but it should still be in the patch notes.\n\n\n_____________________________________________\n\n\n**[EDIT]:**\n\nMy apologies. \nSo it appears, I may have posed criticism of the death recap prematurely...\n\nhttps://imgur.com/4jffdez\n\nLet's start again.\nPlease direct your attention to the 2nd image provided.\n\nThe recap clearly shows, I was killed by Xin _(who was, in actual-fact, on my team)_.  He accomplished this feat by using Aatrox's Q.  Said Q did 801 magic damage. _(which I find interesting, seeming Aatrox's Q does physical damage)_. This impressive Xin then managed to get an assist on his own kill. Yet managed to keep a score of 0/0/3.\n\nThen we come to Morgana, who damaged me only with her runes..\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}} \n\nIt has a spicy new look, but to be honest.. \nI don't really see a lot of difference from the old death recap?","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-07-18T04:23:55.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It still has the same bugs of your own teammate contributing to your death.\n\nIt's a somewhat prettier version of the same garbage.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-07-18T09:23:21.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, it's fair enough that there's going to be some bugs.
