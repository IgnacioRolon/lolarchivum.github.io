Whenever some big &#039;extra&#039; buffs come into the game, theres always some champions that they synergise too well with, and then theres others who don&#039;t really get much of a bonus from _any_ of the features.\nFor example, Zed&#039;s power is boosted phenomenally with Thunderlords, more so than other Thunderlords champs like Cassiopeia or Heimerdinger. On the other hand there are champions like Bard, who doesn&#039;t really work that well with _any_ of the keystone masteries.\nSo Zed gets stronger, while Bard isn&#039;t really affected too much.\n\nSo im a little afraid that the new runes will make the strong stronger, and leave the weak where they are.\nFor example, the attack speed buff mentioned, will surge Vayne forward immensely. But leave Corki _(who it&#039;s still useful on, but not as much)_ with less of a meaningful buff. \n\nObviously there will be more buffs than shown in the video, but it&#039;ll probably just end up like masteries, where 90% of mid laners take Thunderlords, 90% of ADC&#039;s take bloodlust. 90% of non-tank supports take windpeakers etc etc.  So in the end all ADC&#039;s will have virtually the same rune, and it&#039;ll affect some way more than others.\n\nSo I&#039;m wondering how you can possibly even out the buffs, so that some champions aren&#039;t thrown forward miles because it synergises with every single part of their kit. While for other champions it&#039;s just a nice little nudge.\n\nAs for 'being taken care of' for having bought so many runes over the years... It had better be like Hextech Annie or something! because I cant really see anything else that could compensate that amount of IP spent. _(I certainly don't want it all back! i have a hard enough time getting rid of what I do have!)_\nI personally am not too fussed _(some people will be though, becasue they could have had so many more champions for so many years if they hadn't spent it all on runes.)_ So It'll be interesting to see what they come up with.\n\nAs for Voice chat.... yea.... no thanks...\n\nWhat do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-05-31T03:16:43.611+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as they do it like Overwatch where you can opt out of the voice channel entirely, then I'd be okay. Otherwise, it's not really necessary, since any duos or teams would already be using Discord or Teamspeak. \n\nAnd I agree that the compensation for spending thousands of IP (many many many hours of grinding) on Runes + a good deal of RP on Rune Pages had better be something more than \"oh, here's a full refund and a pat on the back\".\n\nI do like the sound of the Honour System, although there should be something where groups of friends can't abuse it. And from the looks of it, I didn't see an Honourable Opponent. Does that mean you can only honour teammates, and not the Godlike triehard who you laned against?","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-05-31T03:22:36.750+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> **The new honor system seems to have gained inspiration from the Overwatch post-game card system.

We address it in two major ways:\n> 1) Individual honors per game aren't tied to most of the system rewards. For Honor, the idea is recognizing consistent good vibes rather than just one standout performance like Champ Mastery. 2) The one reward type (no spoilers) that is tied to per-game honors weights honors from strangers higher than those from premades\" - NaKyle\n\nHope those answers help.\n\nAnd totally one factor about why Voice chat hasn't made it into the game is because it had viable substitutes for players who wanted it which pushed it further down in the priority list.","replies":[{"poster":"PittBallz","date":"2017-05-31T05:28:10.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-05-31T06:08:26.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was referring to Percival9's comment. \n\n\"As long as they do it like Overwatch where you can opt out of the voice channel entirely, then I'd be okay.

The runes changes make them sooooooo much easier to obtain for newer players like me, and I hate the current rune system which barely impacts the game at all. I think the voice chat system might end up like in Overwatch where you either have \"the rager\" (imagine Tyler1 on a voice chat...) or some Indian guy trying to sell you his BBQ chicken. If you even get one rager on your team the voice chat becomes unusable because you just have one dumbass yelling into his mic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-05-31T03:55:49.076+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The runes and honour updates look AMAZING, well done Riot, might of gained a little more respect now. But the most important issue I want to address right now is **Voice Chat**. Because I've seen the majority of the comments here are AGAINST it. I just want to let you know Riot THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO WANT IT. If you want to cater for both sides I HIGHLY suggest you do it exactly like Overwatch has done it. Implement a button in the tab screen maybe that allows you to drop in and out of the voice chat room, that way the players have a choice if they want to **participate** or not. Keeps us serious gamers satisfied and the socially awkward casual players happy too.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-31T09:18:22.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Opt in is 100% necessary for something like this, and I can't imagine Riot going any other way with it. The biggest concern is ofc, while chat logs are easy to monitor, voice logs are not, so they may be looking into expanding the report categories and honour categories for voice chat. \n\nAs difficult as it is to monitor voice logs, someone who gets honoured for being a good sport in voice chat every game, but then reported in one, probably isn't who they should be looking at, whereas someone who is being reported every game is. It's also possible they could whip up something with the analytics from players mutes, since I imagine they will do the same with voice as with text where you can mute individual players (can you do this in OW? I don't really play ranked so I rarely use it).\n\nI'm on of the fence sitters when it comes to voice chat. I see games where voice chat would solve everything, but also plenty where it would be a detriment so I'm sort of 50/50 as to whether I'd want it or not. Personally I wouldn't use it outside of ranked...ever, but I think for ranked at least it can be a very valuable tool if done right. That said, I'd rather wait longer and have it done right than have it now and have it be terrible.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-05-31T10:39:17.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't use it outside of ranked either, I rarely every play normals and when I do it's just to have some casual fun, so I wouldn't care at all if it was a ranked only feature.

I'm really keen to finally see revamps honour in game.\n\nAs for Runes Reforged I think we will have to wait for more details before we can actually judge. I actually think keystone masteries are in a good place (totally not biased =P).  I think inevitably on release it wont be ideal (lucky it will be preseason) but over time it will get to a good spot just like what happened with key stone masteries. Like how when Keystones first came out it was League of Thunderlords and now you rarely see a game like that.\n\nMid laners use DFT, Thunderlords, Stormraiders\nMarksman use Ferver or Warlords (with the odd stormraiders on like a kog maw).\nSupports can go down for windspeakers, DFT, Thunderlords, or bond of stone depending on what type of support they are looking to be. (I've seen Bards use Thunderlords and Bond of Stone)\n\nI think overall the reason I am most excited about Runes Reforged is that it moves to a more compelling pregame system where there is potential for adjusting choices based of factors like team comps and match ups. Rather than having a few preset stat boosts that were pulled from pro builds lol...that was quite boring for me.\n\nVoice chat....polarizing indeed.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-31T01:32:19.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I beat you to it them xD haha\nIt is all very exciting!\n\nOh yea, Keystones are in a good place, don't get me wrong! But like we saw with league of thunderlords and Yasuo/Trynd with old warlords bloodlust. It does take a bit of time for things to get to a good place. I fear with even more instrumental buffs, it could take even longer to get runes into a good place. But I'm open minded haha we will see how it goes!\n\nAs for Bard, with his regular build, he doesn't quite have enough AP to make thunderlords as useful as other champs. Bond of stone uses maximum HP, and while Bard gets quite survivable through resistances, his HP is lacking compared to proper tank supports, who make use of the mastery much better.\nSo he doesn't really make too much use of either in comparison to other champs. _(personally I go thunderlords on him, cos damage bot lane seems to be a thing atm :P)_\n\nI agree with you 100% about making pre-game more impactful strategy wise. \nI am the same, it was a little boring for me.\nI have specific mastery and rune pages for Azir, Sol, Taliyah and Kalista and then general ones for everyone else _(tanky jung, AP Assassin, etc etc)_ and it's just become like a game of match-the-dots; \nOh Im vsing a Talon, and my team has tons of tanks? \n**Pick Azir. Pick Azir mastery. Pick Azir Runes. Pick Shurima ward.**\nOh im vsing a Viktor and my team has few tanks? \n**Pick Azir. Pick Azir mastery. Pick Azir Runes. Pick Shurima ward.**\n\nSo am welcoming a change there, one that can be more flexible. ^^\n\n\nMy beef with voice chat is that in normals, you don't have to use it, so you don't have to listen to the squabbles. But in ranked.. you cant afford to give the enemy the advantage of communication without doing it yourself. So you are forced to talk, and therefore listen.\nAlso it sucks for people who due to their environments _(like in a public place, or in a house with lots of people)_ can't be talking while playing, and puts them at a disadvantage.\n\nHopefully the honour system will make people less irritable in game, so there will be less toxicity in voice chat. _(which I'm sure was one of the reasons the team has decided to implement voice chat.)_","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2017-05-31T23:42:31.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can someone do a TLDR for me.\nPlease.\n<3","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-06-01T02:45:28.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll try to make it as short and simple as I can.\n\nTLDR Honour: Changed to be more like Mastery, Provides certain perks at higher levels, Can now only honour 1 player per game (it seems), Categories changed.\n\nTLDR Runes and Masteries: Now combined into just \"Runes\", Keystone Runes providing a larger impact on gameplay than standard runes (much like Keystone Masteries), Now completely free to all players, Fully editable in champion select, players will be \"compensated\" for the IP/RP put into runes and rune pages.\n\nTLDR Voice Chat: Exploring how it could be effectively implemented to satisfy as many players as possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2017-06-01T23:19:34.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=E9KeXM5E,comment-id=00080000,timestamp=2017-06-01T02:45:28.096+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;ll try to make it as short and simple as I can.\n> \n> TLDR Honour: Changed to be more like Mastery, Provides certain perks at higher levels, Can now only honour 1 player per game (it seems), Categories changed.\n> \n> TLDR Runes and Masteries: Now combined into just &quot;Runes&quot;, Keystone Runes providing a larger impact on gameplay than standard runes (much like Keystone Masteries), Now completely free to all players, Fully editable in champion select, players will be &quot;compensated&quot; for the IP/RP put into runes and rune pages.\n> \n> TLDR Voice Chat: Exploring how it could be effectively implemented to satisfy as many players as possible.\n\nOh, well then.\nThe Voice chat sounds productive, but only if the team were serious.\nHonour sounds great, but the cons can sometimes stack against the odds, I mean if you're partying with friends a lot, and the guy is a salty fuck, then well the rewards would be given unfairly.\nRunes and Masteries sounds great - TY riot on the free runes.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-06-02T01:04:05.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Honour sounds great, but the cons can sometimes stack against the odds, I mean if you&#x27;re partying with friends a lot, and the guy is a salty fuck, then well the rewards would be given unfairly.\n\nTo quote Marauder quoting NaKyle:\n> The one reward type (no spoilers) that is tied to per-game honors weights honors from strangers higher than those from premades","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2017-06-02T01:44:58.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-06-01T10:43:21.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=E9KeXM5E,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-05-31T00:03:35.563+0000)\n>\n> As for Voice chat.... yea.... no thanks...\n> \n> What do you guys think?\n\nAgreed, no way will I be talking to the 12ies on this server.

Seems like something that will really help turn the community around a bit and give people more incentive for being well mannered/behaved, rather than just being this little thing that no one cares about.\n\nAs for the rune/mastery changes, I like that Riot is trying to improve the efficiency (for lack of a better word) on how you can set up for any given match. Going from having 2 separate systems to something that brings it all together under one \"flag\" seems like it will really help for clarity's sake and make it easier for newer and less experienced players to make more impact-full decisions.\n\nThat said, I am also a bit sceptical about the power \"balance\" the new keystone runes will provide. It certainly seems like something Riot will have to keep a close eye one, and it would probably help to have them go onto the PBE several patches prior to the pre-season to iron out the bugs.\n\nAs for voice chat, I just hope there will be an option to mute it (collectively and for specific players) and have some kind of indication for whether a particular player has muted you, otherwise it just wouldn't make sense as an effective form of communication.","replies":[]}]}
