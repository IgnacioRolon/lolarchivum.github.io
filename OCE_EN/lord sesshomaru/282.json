Whilst you are attacking with soldiers, you cannot autoattack. Their attack take the place of your autto attack.

Yes they do, and that in no way affects electrocute.\n\nIf affecting the attack timer makes your ability an auto attack. Then what are Yasuo and Ezreal's Qs then?

Yet are treated as autos for all intents and purposes.\n\n> they each attack the thing that you click on, they don't attack seperate targets\n\nThey aim their attacks at the same target _(just like how both of Zed's shuriken aim at the same place)_, but they can and do hit multiple targets, sometimes different ones to each other. Often (just like Zed's shuriken) the soldiers do hit the same target, but (like Zed's shuriken) just becasue they were aimed at the same target doesn't mean they will all hit. (just like Zed's shuriken) if you move while its coming at you, it will miss, and likely hit a different target.\n\nYou cant aim Azir's soldiers separate of one another, but you cant aim Zed's shuriken separately either, they both aim towards the cursor, just like how Azir's soldiers all aim towards the target.\n\n> _\"all of their damage is identical\"_\n\n> Multiple soldiers _**can**_ _(implying they also cannot)_ strike the same target, with **_each soldier_** beyond the first dealing 25% damage _(note. meaning their damage stacks, each soldier may or may not deal a different amount of damage and thus and ISNT 'identical')_.

And their damage is calculated in the same way as Zed's, the first does damage, each subsequent hit from additional sources deals less damage.\nThis means that they too are a seperate instance of the ability _(like Zed's shadow shuriken)_, but they don't proc electrocute.\n\nSo either Taric's stun works the same way as Zed's shuriken, or Azir's soldiers do. Yet neither of them proc electrocute.\n\nBasically it boils down to this:\n**1.** Either its 1 stack of electrocute per ability cast. _(each time you press the button, it doesn't matter how many times that ability hits, it counts as 1)_\n**2.** Or its 1 stack of electrocute per ability hit. _(each time an ability [or part of an ability] lands on a target, thats 1 stack)_\n\nRegardless of why, or what coding causes what, every other champ in the game works under the first option, only Zed works under the second one's logic. \nSee the continuity problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Hellopolite","date":"2018-07-21T05:14:25.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so does items count in that regard as well or only no damage moves? eg randuins? righteous glory? iceborn gauntlets slowfield?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-07-22T00:21:06.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Short answer: Yes. :P\n\nThe actives of items like Randuins and Righteous Glory do count towards the proc of electrocute.\nSo do summoner spells like ignite.\n\nAs for how item passives like Thornmail are treated by electrocute, I don't know.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellopolite","date":"2018-07-22T00:53:25.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"surely thornmail, its a damage source.\n\nmaybe not stat affecting auras though, like frozen heart?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-07-22T05:51:41.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't tested thornmail, so I couldn't say.\nBeing a 'passive' though it could be different, as you're not using an ability.\n\nI haven't tested, but I highly highly doubt auras would affect electrocute.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hellopolite","date":"2018-07-21T02:31:51.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pantheons e isnt multi proc hit for electrocute either. stick a tiamats in there, harder for ranged","replies":[]},{"poster":"Montiness","date":"2018-07-18T15:22:16.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For example, they aren't treated seperately.... although the hitbox is changed from point one to two, it would not be triggering a second instance of the ability, where zed's does.
