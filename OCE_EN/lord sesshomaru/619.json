We're working on an issue right now with Ranked Team queues, so we've disabled them for now until we get a fix going.  Once we fix the bug and get it out to everyone, 3v3 and 5v5 will be re-enabled.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-09-30T10:34:41.136+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"'3v3 and 5v5 will be re-enabled.'\nSo does that mean ranked 3v3 will finally be enabled on OCE then?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Koalifier","date":"2015-09-30T10:58:54.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh dang, I was not aware that ranked 3v3 is not available on OCE {{item:3070}} \n\nI'm over in the NA office so I'm not as familiar with the OCE server, just trying to help out!\n\nSorry for fanning the fire of false hope, but I do not think there are plans to expand OCE queues right now (I don't work in OCE so I'm making an assumption here), so 3v3 ranked won't come on after the bug is fixed.  Once we realized there was an issue, we jumped to disable queues before more players got affected, but we missed the mark on the ticker message (and I messed up in responding to you).
