Theoretically stopping his team from following in any way while he continues forwards can, and often will, lead to him being where he doesn't want to be. Beyond that only time (and any necessary patches) will tell really.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-08-10T08:24:22.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with that is, it stops when he gets in range of any enemy champion AND it's an engage tool so his entire team CAN just follow him all the way assuming he isn't putting it somewhere stupid.\n\nBecause it is basically a Sivir ult on a tank.","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-08-10T10:32:10.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe it wasn't clear what I was referencing (the counterplay tip regarding Nami in the video). Using CC or zone control abilities to stop Kled's team from following him means that he continues on his way and ends up out of position. Sure, your team might be ultra coordinated and spread out and dodge everything thrown at them, most likely when charging down lane, but in the jungle it'll be more difficult to coordinate something like that.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-08-10T10:37:26.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh right, nevermind me then.\n\nThat said, add a Braum to Kled's team and watch as nothing stops them.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2016-08-11T02:51:57.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"3 Kled games today, all noobs that fed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-08-10T14:26:52.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since Kled now has a passive which effectively helps him stack twice as much hp when he buys item that give HP if they'll revisit Sion's health stacking passive.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-10T22:32:35.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why would they?\n\nSion's passive is Glory in Death.

He likes to go HAM. This means he will be pretty sturdy but not like a tank (Voli, malph etc). His tankiness/damage scale would be around Xin/Fiora is what I am expecting anyway.\n\nFrom what I have seen already I believe this is how you play around Kled;\n\n* Take advantage of his reduced mobility without Skaarl (he can't use Joust [E] when unmounted)\n* His Q which is his main form of poke and slow is a skill shot so try to anticipate and dodge\n* He excels when he goes HAM but this will put him out of position a lot, try to take advantage of this with ganks/ CC in team fights.\n* When he is small do not let him bait you into a fight as Skaarl is going to come back.\n* The above is also actually a cool opportunity, for Kled to be played well he will need to be risky and bait fights/all ins without Skaarl and try to get the bonus health before the fight is over. This means there is also an opportunity to burst him down before Skaarl comes back\n* He's Melee so there's always lane phase advantages there\n* Generally with Divers their biggest weaknesses come from kite and peel (Janna, Karma, Lux, Tristana). Any champions that focus on kiting and peeling will make Kleds life hard\n\nHope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-09T09:52:53.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh ok, thank you! \n\nthat'll help heaps. \n\nIm not going to lie, he scares me ;S and the champion spotlight didn't seem to provide much in the way of playing against him.\n\nthis helps tho :) thanks","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-08-10T05:37:58.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just wait till he is played in the LCS and nerfed into the ground.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-10T06:27:23.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"_\"Wait till he is played in LCS and then every bronze/silver/gold player plays him non stop for the next 3 years yelling \"[Insert pro-player summoner name here]\" every time they get a kill\"_*","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Revoke","date":"2016-08-09T06:27:02.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Did you also want them to log in and play the matchup for you?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-09T06:37:24.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you misunderstand","replies":[]}]}]}
