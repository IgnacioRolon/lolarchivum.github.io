The pentakill bundle is awesome but yorick and sona leave a bit to be desired.\neven the team skins, SKT T1 Zyra doesnt live up to the rest of them, nor does SSW rengar. Vandal Jax etc.\nbut with the project skins they are all really well designed, there is a good meta team that can be used (a bit on the AD side but no matter) and they are all consistent with particle effects, unlike the mecha and battlecast theme.\nso I&#039;m very very impressed.\n\nthe only downside is that there will be mirror lanes to hell unless you play mid, but going Yas against zed is never fun :/\nbut ill deal haha","replies":[{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2015-08-26T07:08:34.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only Project skin they screwed up was Lucian. The rest are really awesome skins. Not sure what Riot has against Project Yasuo though, giving the other 5 skins more special treatment. Also, for once Riot wants people to buy these skins at 1350RP (so they put in the special load screen) and then punish other people for buying them at 975RP a week later.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-26T01:25:42.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yas will always beat zed if he haz actual skill ;) or that zed is just completely retard","replies":[]}]}
