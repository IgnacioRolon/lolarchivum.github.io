They basically play a different game to us regarding how they actually play, so lets not have champion balances for them and how they play, lets have them for the 99% of people.\r\n\r\nSecond and most important, its because everyone is obsessed with the pro&#039;s and pro youtubers that we get the monotonous repeats of the same few champions in every game, Lee Sin, Zed, Yasuo, Thresh, Vayne etc. etc. for gods sake just make your own decisions and play your own goddamn champions. Just because someone else did well with Zed on youtube doesn&#039;t mean that Zed is the ONLY champ you can ever do well with...\r\nPlus do you really want to play the same champ as everyone else and use the same masteries and same strategies as everyone else?? where the fun in that? and just because a single Korean played Crit Maokai or something once doesn&#039;t mean you need to devote you life to making AD Crit maoki a thing...\r\n\r\nThirdly, and this one doesn&#039;t bother me too much, (i don&#039;t understand why its necessary.. but i still don&#039;t really mind it) but i know a lot of people who do. The in-game chat quality has so little intelligence because of the pro scene, someone gets a kill with zed and everyone on the team yells &quot;FAKER!!!!!! NEW FAKER INBOUND&quot; whenever a thresh lands a hook (which lets be honest is a pretty fucking basic thing to do, and is staple to playing that champion) everyone yells &quot;MADLIFE!! OH YEA!! WOOOOOO&quot;\r\nseriously... why?\r\nWhile playing rugby, if you get a try you don&#039;t suddenly stop and scream &quot;WOOOOOOO RICHIE M&#039;CAW!!! WOOOOO OH YEA!!&quot; or get a penalty kick and go \r\n&quot;DAN FUCKING CARTER PEOPLE! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO&quot;\r\nLikewise with sailing, if you stood up on your boat whenever you passed a buoy and screamed &quot;WOOOO GOD CAPTAIN COOK!!! WOOOOOOOOOO&quot;\r\nnot only would you look like an idiot, but you would actually BE an idiot.\r\nSo how come the rules of being an idiot change when you&#039;re on lol? \r\nI&#039;m not saying you shouldn&#039;t scream out your favourite pro&#039;s name (although why you would is beyond me) I&#039;m just saying have a think about what you&#039;re actually screaming about, so the thresh landed a hook, great! but its not your 100th birthday or anything. Maybe if your Zed did a 1v5 penta and got away really trickily then maybe yelling something would be appropriate, but when a 21/3 Zed ults a 0/12 Nami, yelling &quot;FAKER WOOOOOOO&quot; is just stupid.\r\n\r\nlastly, everyone uses it as justification for EVERYTHING:\r\n&quot;Im pretty good with Yasuo occasionally&quot; &#039;DUDE EVEN FAKER HASNT MASTERED YASUO, WTF ARE YOU SAYING!&#039;\r\n&quot;Please don&#039;t go Zed supp, it doesn&#039;t help us.&quot; &#039;DW MAN I SEEN IT ON YOUTUBE! IT WORKS!&#039;\r\n&quot;Garen is OP, a tank doesn&#039;t need a silence and a 1500+ true damage execute!&quot; &#039;GAREN IS WEAK, THE PRO&#039;S DONT PICK HIM AT ALL WTF ARE YOU ON ABOUT?&#039;\r\n\r\nSeriously just live your own lives the way you want, don&#039;t think the the Pro&#039;s are gods and you need to do every single tiny little thing that they do...\r\n\r\nRemember you will never be able to overtake someone if you can only walk in their footsteps. Think of all the great people in the world, Musicians, Actors, Scientists, Astronaughts, Athletes; David Bowie, Johnny Depp, David Attenborough, Neil Armstrong, Kobe Bryant. Whats the thing they all have in common? They did things differently, they didn&#039;t mindlessly follow someone else, they found what they as individuals were good at and pursued it, and thats what made them successful.\r\n\r\nChoosing lee because you can follow someone else&#039;s &#039;Q-Q-Flash-Kick&#039; is meaningless, Why not master your own champion and put your own combo on the map! \r\n\r\nDo you think your friends will be more impressed that you can follow one of Fakers moves, or that you made your own devastating combo for a champ they didn&#039;t even know was powerful.\r\n\r\nJohnny Depp didn&#039;t become famous by playing roles that everyone else does already, he became famous because he said &#039;no ill do it my way&#039; and did it.\r\n\r\nDont aim to be the 2nd world champion Zed or the 3rd world champion Thresh, aim to be the FIRST Urgot or Zyra World Champion.\r\n\r\nDont be a sheep.\r\n\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-01-20T07:55:58.013+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Problem here is that you say the game is balanced around the pros when it's not.\n\nThe game is balanced around Diamond and Challenger.\n\nIt is true that at a certain time of the year there will be roughly two patches that balance the game around the pros and this is in the weeks leading up to Worlds, by the time Worlds actually starts the rest of the world is two patches deep changing things back to the way they were, and getting ready to change somethings based on what happens at Worlds.\n\nNEVER should a game be balanced around the lowest to mid tier demographic, it should always be mid tier to high tier.\n\nTake a current look at that state of TF2, Valve has no idea how to balance.\nEver since the release of a weapon called the Phlogistinator for the Pyro the community has been crying for it to be nerfed.\nAt release this weapon has a MMMPH meter that fills by causing fire damage (something that is really easy as the Pyro :P ) once full you can taunt to activate the MMMPH during the taunt you become resistant to damage by 95% and heal all your health, once the taunt is over your MMMPH bar starts to decrease and while it does you have 100% crit chance.\nNow the only downside was that this weapon couldn't airblast, a mechanic that sets terrible Pyros in contrast again good and great Pyros, so obviously terrible Pyros would pick up this weapon and their stats would increase to that of the good Pyros without any effort.\nDespite how powerful this weapon was, it wasn't used much in the years since it's release.\n\nFast forward to the latest balance change to TF2, Valve ignored the community crying for the nerf of the Plog, and instead buffed it.\nThey increased the weapons base damage, they made the taunt phase turn you 100% invulnerable.\nThis weapon is now the equivalent of a Vayne who's silver bolts did damage on every autoattack after landing three AA on a single target and then tumbling.\nIt still doesn't have airblast, but now it's become stupidly popular and you'll see 90% of the Pyros running around in pub matches with it.\nAs someone who has played the pro scene in TF2, it is really disappointing me to see this, I can go Pyro with the stock flamethrower and dominate the game no trouble, but I see these other players who would otherwise have no idea that they need to set enemy players on fire reaching my scores.\n\nHere's a little fun thing about the pro scene in TF2, if an item is considered unbalanced, over powered or just stupid and has no real place, it's banned from the matches.\nThe list is really high here, you might as well say if the weapon is not stock, you have no chance of ever getting to use it in Highlander.\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} \n\nRiot can be questionable at times when it comes to balance, but at least Riot understands what BALANCE is.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on that horrid mess of unbalanced filth that is DOTA2. It's what happens with you get a figure head to \"make\" a game out of a terribly unpolished mod.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-01-20T09:47:50.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well i cant deny that sounds horrible....\nhow... do they... what even is intelligence?\nholy shit...\nthank god riot are far more onto it than that. \n\nAllow me to re-phrase:\nover the course of my time playing lol i have seen things that need to be changed, but because it sat nicely with the pro's the pleas for it to be changed were ignored or brushed off with the usual vague response. Im not saying the entire game is structured around pro's, but there have been  a few things that riot don't want to have to deal with and don't have to because it doesn't affect the pro's and so they don't.\n\nand anyway challenger and high diamond players are just the second rung down from pro's, when most of the players are around silver/gold level.\n\nanyway this post was more about encouraging people not to blindly follow the pro's and youtubers.

Cause i haven't seen this in high silver to low gold, maybe the occasional thing when it's actually a good madlife thing but that's about it.)\n\nFact is these flashy champs have high outplay potential, that means that they are good champions if you can outplay the opponent, this covers 100% of the pro scene, but covers just as much in lower elos because people refuse to understand that they aren't good at the game, complaining on boards isn't going to help you.","replies":[]}]}
