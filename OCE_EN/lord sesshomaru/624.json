Her coolodowns have never been a problem (especially after Riot just lowered them), and she isn&#039;t a champion like Syndra who needs CDR asap. The passive on Morellos is also very situational, and is far from essential on her kit the way it would be on other mages. \r\n\r\nSo whats the reason for it suddenly being a core item on her? There must be a reason, but i just am wondering what it is, and why Morellos is recommended over Items like RoA, Rylais and Lyandries, which are all perfect for her. \r\n\r\nSomeone please let me in on the know xD\r\n\r\n{{champion:163}} {{item:3165}}","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-10-15T01:03:43.610+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whos taliyah","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-10-15T01:06:22.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but aren't you the king of forgotten champs?\n\nMr lvl 7 Yorick and Urgot :P","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-10-15T01:07:51.722+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You got me.
