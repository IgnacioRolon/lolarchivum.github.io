Maybe RIOT will even throw in a Triumphant Ryze for the winning factions team?\n\n**Requirements (So far):**\n\nThis is an OCE tournament, but anyone can participate, _(hopefully we see some Rioters in there) _\nOnly champions from your team&#039;s faction can be selected. \n\n**Concerns:**\n\nThe factions aren&#039;t fair, Demacia has a far larger and more diverse champion pool than The Void. Players will have to accept that this is a fun tournament and as such may be slightly disadvantaged depending on the faction they are a part of.\n\n_________\n\nSo if you are interested in the idea of an OCE Runeterra battle-royale to decide the ultimate faction on Runeterra, show it in the Poll below. \nand if anyone has any ideas/criticisims/wants-to-put-their-hand-up-to-help, lets discuss it below.\n\n_Reminder: Nothing as of yet is certain to happen, this is the bare bones of an idea atm._","replies":[{"poster":"Ascalon127","date":"2016-08-25T08:23:11.051+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Ionia woud beat everyone\nThey have \nYi\nZed\nYasuo\nFiora\nJax\nIrelia\nAkali\nLee Sin\nWukong\nJust to name a few","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2016-08-25T11:13:45.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(Fiora is demacian lol)\n\n*peaceful*\n\n\n\nYi, WuKong, Lee Sin, Yasuo, Jax: we kil u .5 seconds max in the nam of peace","replies":[{"poster":"Ascalon127","date":"2016-08-25T23:45:03.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my bad.
