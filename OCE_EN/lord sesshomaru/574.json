He was the holy crusader who protected Runeterra from Void excursions after having his family taken by it.  Now that is exactly what Kai&#039;sa is, and Kassadin&#039;s reworked lore is basic as.... \r\n\r\n_&quot;His daughter was killed, and he is now basically Liam Neeson on a vengeance, and while Liam Neeson is awesome, the fact that his daughter happens to still be alive, and it was kinda-semi her fault anyway, sort of undermines his whole purpose for existing...&quot;_\r\n\r\nAlso the relationship between Kassadin and Malzahar is completely non-existent now. Which is the worst part....\r\nKassadin blames Malz for his daughter&#039;s &#039;death&#039;, when in reality Malz wasn&#039;t even directly involved. And malz has no apparent reason to believe that Kass even exists. \r\n\r\nThey used to basically live for each other, like Batman and the Joker. \r\n\r\nIts sad :/\r\n\r\nSurely you could have invented a new lore for Kai&#039;sa, and not stolen Kassadin&#039;s _(what happened to her being kidnapped by Malz and imprisoned in the Void? Thats the whole reason we even have her in the first place, because that was the story.)_\r\n\r\n\r\n____________\r\n\r\nOn a positive note, &#039;Where Icathia once stood&#039; is a very good read, for anyone interested.\r\nhttps://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_AU/story/where-icathia-once-stood/","replies":[{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2018-03-10T19:00:57.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was always under the impression that Kai'Sa was Kassadin's daughter. Kai'Sa was born to loving parents in a desert (ie Shurima) and her village collapsed and was consumed by the Void. She then followed a light and also entered the Void.\n\nKassadin is also from Shurima, and his daughter was taken by the Void. He wasn't consumed with the village because he was out on a merchant's run, returning from Piltover. He found survivors from the event and rushed to where the village once was, but couldn't find his family. And after a while, he dove into the Void to look for them.\n\nThose two bios fit together so perfectly. And with Kai'Sa having a similar law to Kassadin, isn't that a bit like \"like father like daughter\"?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-03-10T22:26:11.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, she is his daughter, that is confirmed I believe.\nThats not in question.\n\nWhat I'm annoyed about, is that Kai'sa's lore, is basically a rough rehash of old Kassadin's lore, and the new Kassadin lore is very average, and doesn't explain at all why he can use void power, and has absolutely no connection with Malzahar.\n\nKass/Malz used to be like Batman and the Joker.\nIf my memory is correct, both separately found their way to Icathia, and gained their power there when faced with the Void, Malzahar was consumed by it. While Kassadin, realising there was no escape from its clutches, willingly let it enter his body, with the intention of using its own power against it.\n\nMalzahar constantly tries to turn Kassadin to his side _(which is what Harbinger Kassadin is all about, it is the version of Kassadin if he joined up with Malz)_, and when Malz failed to turn Kass, he kidnapped Kass's daughter and held her hostage in the Void. \n\nFor years we have wanted his daughter released as a champion, so we can find out what happened next in the story.\nNow, when she finally comes out, they completely change the whole story, so none of it ever happened...\n\nKassadin's new lore doesn't explain why he is all corrupted and can use void power.\nIt ends as some normal merchant guide armed to the teeth with magical relics. \n\nWhen I look at Kassadin in game.... I ain't seeing no relics...\nIm seeing a hell of a lot of Void power.","replies":[]}]}]}
