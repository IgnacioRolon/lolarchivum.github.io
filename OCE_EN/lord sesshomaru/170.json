We need to actually die to spend our money to push the last bit.\n\nIt is all terrible all over, you get players who, like yourself, constantly push the enemy under their tower, can't take the tower, yet when you die you lose your lane instantly.\n\nThe balance from laning to mid game and onwards needs to be fixed something shocking, you can't be having a stale mate for 10 minutes and than lose 3 towers in 3 minutes, it makes no sense.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-12-21T11:45:12.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does make no sense, that you are pushed for 12 minutes and accomplish nothing then die once and BOOM lane gone :(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Epica","date":"2015-12-21T02:17:10.060+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get what you mean about the towers, i had a game yesterday where i was playing Mundo (Full tank) and i was able to do 300+ damage to towers every auto attack for 5 seconds simply by activating my E (At LvL16) i was doing significantly more damage to the towers, inhibs and nexus than our ADC and Mid laner (Zed). \n\nI agree this Pre-Season has been somewhat unbalanced, the changes to Rageblade and the Masteries pretty much brought hybrids back into the game and hybrids have been dominating everything in this Pre-Season so far, Rammus, Trundle and Mundo have come back into play this Pre-season too with the buffs to Mundo along with the mastery changes, new items/ item changes and tower changes making them super strong. \n\nThe Miss Fortune + Janna, Soraka, Sona or Nami combo is pretty broken at the moment but people tend to be sheep and mostly play Vayne because she's seen as a \"hyper carry\" even though MF can completely out trade and demolish her 1v1 (Had a game yesterday where i was playing MF + Janna against Vayne + Anivia and Vayne couldn't even trade with me, i was forcing her out of lane nonstop by getting her low and at one point she was 3 levels behind) So Miss fortune is pretty devastating at the moment, if you main ADC you'll already know she's considered freelo. But something does need to be done about these champions A.S.A.P , Vayne, Yasuo, Lee Sin and Brand, are spammed almost every game and it get's annoying, people jumping on the trend train and playing them because they're considered to be \"Hyper carries\" are the worst. \n\nBut in saying all that, it is the pre-season after all so you can't really expect much, massive changes have been made to the game so naturally one broken thing leads to another and i'm sure you realize by now that this game will never be balanced. \n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-21T03:13:25.799+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"mf is so broken atm. cc you and thats a free 4k damage in 3 seconds on her ult. and her poke in lane is so bs, 350 damage in 1 hit at lv 1? wtf are you thinking rito","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Garenplank","date":"2015-12-20T23:35:46.093+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea its shit, the turrets are stupid....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-12-20T22:23:10.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is pre-season terrible?

Rioters have already said they are not happy with 20 minutes being the standard, they want the 40 minutes back.\nThey're also not happy with dragon being almost ignored, same with rift herald and baron.\nAs it currently stands an outer turret is worth more than Dragon or Rift Herald.\nMost teams will only actively go for first dragon, and then only take subsequent dragons in order to keep first dragon from the enemy team.\n\nIt should also be noted that people hate on the pre-season patches every year, but quickly get over it and play on. How about people just stop complaining about feature they know will stay?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-12-20T23:52:26.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Minions do need to be fixed, if you get slowed in or even near a minion wave its just a snare. (GG Nasus)\n\nthe main problem i have with the pre-season is that before the 12 minute mark you cant do shit to turrets even if your lane is pushed the whole time and as soon as it hits 12/13 min AD champs just melt them like butter, i think there needs to be more reward for having your lane permanently pushed because its a viable strategy for pushing turrets if you're champ isn't the 'all in kill the enemy' type champ, yet it just is just impractical to do atm, it has all the risks of being ganked etc but it needs some reward.\n\nand the ignoring of dragon is annoying, every time i jungle I'm forced to solo it because no one can be fucked, and tbh i just give up on rift herald, you cant solo it and no one wants to miss their precious 2 minions while they come help with it.\n\nim not complaining about features i know will stay because I'm hoping that my complaining will help to remove them.\nand this is the first pre-season i have ever complained about, not because its all different and I'm scared of change and all that, but because i genuinely think it inhibits the game.","replies":[]}]}]}
