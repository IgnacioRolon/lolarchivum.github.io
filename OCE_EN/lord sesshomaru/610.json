These days, you need at least 400 move speed just to stay alive.\n\nObviously this shifts a lot of power around, its easier to get caught out, it makes life much harder for split pushers etc. \n\n___________________\n\n#My observations with Taliyah\n\nI notably feel this change with Taliyah&#039;s W. \nLast season I seemed to be able to hit the vast majority of my W/E combos, perhaps 8/10, but now my average seems to be significantly less.\nThe increased movement speed of champions gives them a much larger circle of possible locations they can get to within the 1 second it takes for her W to activate, making successfully predicting and landing the ability much harder _(not to mention its awkward casting system)_.\n\nIm not saying that Taliyah or other champs need a buff or anything, far from it!  But I have noticed my personal potency with Taliyah decrease somewhat significantly from last season to this season.\n\nI&#039;ve also noticed less Nami players around, and I seem to have a much easier time escaping from Cho&#039;Gath&#039;s Q in time _(from which, escape used to be only a fools hope)_.\n\nI don&#039;t think these are huge issues in their current form _(if they even are issues)_, every champ should have his/her time in the sun _(and in the shade, *Cough, Zed&#039;s turn, cough.)_ \nBut I keep wondering, what if, in the same way damage seems to be doing, movement speed keeps constantly creeping into the game, with no effort to actively halt it.\n\n_____________________\n\n#Change?\n\nWhat do you think will happen? How will this affect champions whose kits rely on ground targeted moves such as Taliyah? Champs with skill shots like Ezreal? Split pushers like Yorick? Chasers like Udyr? How do you think this will affect fights? If higher map mobility makes split pushing less worthwhile, and makes getting caught out much easier, how will this affect gameplay?\n\nWill the fear of getting caught out, and the hope of catching someone out, increase warding?\n\nWill/does higher levels of MS funnel gameplay into relying on all out brawls? \n\nIve noticed that the second half of many team fights these days seems to be a drawn-out retreat, with one team running away, and kills coming less from duelling and more from stragglers being hit by poke and CC as they run away and so fall behind and are consumed by the chasing team. \n\nIs this merely the current meta, or like damage, is this creep a more permanent and hard to reverse, aspect of the game?\n\nRiot are already afraid of cutting down the damage champs have, because it is off-putting when your champ feels like its doing less damage. And they&#039;re terrified of players feeling like that _(they said as much in regards to URF &#039;causing players to quit&#039;)_\nIt will also feel bad when your champs move around at a more sluggish pace again like in older seasons. Does this mean they&#039;ll be afraid of decreasing movement speed too?\n\n______________\n\n#Discussion\n\nWhat are your thoughts on movement speed creep?\nIs it good? Bad?\nMore fun? Less fun?\n\nHow are other Taliyah players feeling on landing their W? \nWhat about Nami or Cho players?\nAre Pantheon/Ziggs/Xerath players finding it harder to land their ultimates? etc.\nHow is this affecting _(or not)_ your champs?\n\nWhat do you guys think increased movement speed brings to the game? \nWhat do you predict will happen?\n\nI&#039;m interested to see how other players are perceiving current movement speed.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2018-03-14T08:19:06.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One does simply walk away from morde.\n\nRip morde","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2018-03-13T11:39:13.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"More movespeed for the movespeed gods!\n\nI like having high movespeed, but at the same time on certain champions (most notably ADCs) I loathe buying boots on, 2 zeal items plus whatever MS passive you have and boots are quickly irrelevant if you're not going for Swifties or Mobos.\n\nThere are plenty of champions I feel are heavily lacking in base movespeed like Evelynn after her rework, her kit is so dependent of being able to navigate through the back lines of an enemy team and take those picks, or ganking like a maniac but she finds it difficult because of extremely low base MS, especially compared to other assassins in her flavour.\n\nWhat does more movespeed mean for Skillshots and AOE?\nShort answer: nothing.\nLonger answer: you get used to it and improve your timing/skill/strategy.\n\nDoes it effect split pushing?\nWell not at all, the most effective split push champs in the game are ones with high MS/mobility and good wave clear.\nTryndamere, Yi, Udyr etc.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd don't forget.\nALL PRAISE THE SPEED DEMON HECARIM!","replies":[]}]}
