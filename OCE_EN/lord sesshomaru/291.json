But the alternative is to ward the bush, and these days that's not actually much safer.\r\n\r\nMost champions that we are scared will jump out of the bush and kill us, can quite easily jump out of the bush and kill us from the range it takes to place a ward.  Damage creep is a very major issue, and while taking a shot or two while placing a ward in the past was survivable, these days it's usually a death-sentence.\r\n\r\nAnd Jumpy-stabby champs like Rengar and/Kha'Zix etc aren't the only ones.  If there's a Blitz/Lux/Morg/Thresh/etc in the game, unless you have sight on them, it's safer just to not try to ward up in the first place.  That shouldn't be the case.\r\n\r\nThe game has evolved a lot over its life, and this range _(at least that i'm aware of)_ hasn't changed at all.\r\nI think it's time that the warding distance be evaluated, the same way the number of bans was increased.\r\n\r\nWarding is what we _should_ be doing, it is the counter to being jumped from out of the bush.  I don't see why we should be punished for doing it.  It's supposed to be a safety mechanism, I think it should be a little safer.\r\n\r\nWhat does everyone think about this?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-05T06:45:05.000+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have a problem with the range personally. In my mind warding should always be as proactive objective, not a reactive one. And the better you are at being proactive with your wards (knowing where key objectives are, knowing where ambush or ganks spots are, reading the patterns fo the enemy jungler etc) the better overall your teams vision and awareness will be.\n\nIt's essentially a risk assessment. If you know such problematic champs are on the enemy team, you need to be on top of your wards. Getting them down when you know the lane or jungler has backed/died or is elsewhere on the map, not waiting until you realise they're looking for something. If you don't have eyes on them, and you want to ward, that's when you need to make that risk assessment.\n\nFrom my personal perspective, warding is another one of those things in this game that is easy to learn but difficult to master. There's a lot more nuance than most people seem to grasp, and improving skill with warding is just as important as improving your defensive play, or your objective pressure, or your map positioning, etc etc.\n\nOn the other hand, if they were to extend the ward placement range, I think it would have a much greater negative impact on ambush champions and strats than you might think. As in, to the point where they would probably have to buff all those jumpy-stabbys to equalise it, which I would imagine you would enjoy even less :P","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-10-05T14:55:34.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that warding should be pro-active, not re-active.  But you are seeing it from a mostly support perspective, you can get new wards every time you B.  Non-supports have limited access to wards, so wasting them hurts a lot more.  So I don't think warding _(in any capacity)_ should be as risky as it is.  Considering safety is their purpose.\n\nAgreed you should wait for the Jungler to be elsewhere or dead, but we don't always have that luxury.  Sometimes they just stay in Jungle and farm up, or otherwise don't show themselves.  But we still have to ward in those times.\n\nHmmmmmm, I see where you're coming from with having an impact on the jumpy-shabby champs, and id agree if the vision radius of the wards was increased, but if its just the cast range, I don't think it'll remove Kha'Zix from the game or anything. After all, the counter to being ambushed _IS_ warding, so therefore the act of warding shouldn't have to put you in the very position you're trying to avoid by placing it.  But I am seeing it from a squishy mid-lane perspective, with jungle quite literally all around my lane.\n\n__________________________\n\nYou might laugh at this considering its me saying it, but I actually wouldn't be opposed to ambush champs being buffed, providing it was their _ambush_ capability that gets buffed, not their raw strength.\n\nAnd by that, I mean I think they should be able to shred you quickly, providing they do catch you by surprise, thats fair enough thats their purpose.  _**However**_, if you do spy an ambush champ before they can ambush you, I think there needs to be more things you can do about it to nullify their 1-hit potential.  That makes them high-risk high-reward.  If they use their stealth properly and you have no idea they are coming, you deserve to go up in smoke.  But if you catch them red-handed, they should be severely disadvantaged for it.  \n\nKha'Zix almost has it right in my opinion with his isolation thing. _(more so than champs like Rengo, who can jump in on anyone at anytime relatively safely)_ Although I think the payoff for hitting an isolated target should be much greater, but the reverse should also be true.  If the target isn't isolated, he should be severely disadvantaged, forcing him to think longer about planning an ambush, and less just capitalising on the moment.\n\nThat seems like a more fun play style in my mind.  Sitting in the bushes for a while, stalking, waiting, plotting the perfect kill.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-10-05T07:49:27.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> \n> On the other hand, if they were to extend the ward placement range, I think it would have a much greater negative impact on ambush champions and strats than you might think.

Hardly any patches or game design changes have been made more towards helping the less maneuverable champions. \nEven if for example the maneuverability impaired champions had a dedicated ward spot as a bonus? Every year, every new champion, every patch always new ways for the maneuverability type champions to make plays and kill everyone easier and more efficiently. Just seems unbalanced or an oversight to not make a change of some kind to that area of the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-10-07T03:27:17.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about we bring back ol' unupgraded sweeping lens? The one where you could activate a small area of red trinket from like 500-2000 (scaling with level) range away?\n\nI used to take it on ranged carries in assassin heavy games simply as a way to not get blindsided trying to facecheck a bush.\n\nIt's not good, generally you'd want upgraded red trinkets for vision control, regular wards gave solid basic vision control and farsight wards gave permanent incremental vision control, but if the rest of your team had those covered, the sweeping lens was a way to check bushes for enemies, stealthed or not, from a safe range on a much shorter cooldown than farsight wards.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2019-10-05T09:11:54.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Damage creep is a very major issue\"\n\nMaybe that's where riot should start instead of ward range.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-10-05T14:56:59.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree they should be looking at how to combat that.\n\nBut ward range can be adjusted literally overnight.
