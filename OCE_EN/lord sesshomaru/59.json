You can not get further apart than those two.\r\n\r\nNow this is the part that needs to be made clear (because lt&#039;s obviously NOT):\r\n**Lee Sin**, fits into the **Assassin** category... Not the _support_ category. Therefore, when you go Support Lee Sin, what you are actually going is &quot;Assassin Lee Sin, in the bot lane.&quot; \r\n\r\nNow, i am compelled to remind you, that Assassins (with the exception of Vayne, because someone fucked up in the champ design process) have no place in the Bot lane for 2 very important reasons.\r\n\r\n1. Your ADC is the most valuable player on your team, they are where your team&#039;s main damage comes from, their build is very expensive, and you stealing all their kills is not helping them achieve it any faster. (&quot;you get CS ill get Kills&quot;, is not an adequate solution, &quot;You get CS and Kills, and ill get lots of gold from assists and the support item THAT I AM SUPPOSED TO BUY.&quot; is a valid solution.)\r\n\r\n2. This is the Assassin meta, your team are retards and already have 3 assassins, they DO NOT need a 4th. What they DO need is someone who can help keep them alive long enough to actually do their job and Assassinate people, (this help will most likely come in the form of a tank, because you can be 100% sure that the other 3 members of the team wont have picked a tank.)\r\n\r\nApply your knowledge of playing Lee Sin to champ select, You are used to making 1 very important decision as Lee &quot;I have hit something with my Q: Do i take my finger off the keyboard and live, or do i dash into that 1v5 and die miserably amongst insults from my team&quot;\r\nPlease take that style of playing into champ select, when you get support as your role, pretend that you have Q&#039;d someone, you need to engage those brain cells and think: Is going &#039;Assassin Lee Sin in the bot lane&#039; going to help my team or is it just going to help me. Do what is best for the team.\r\n\r\nThe urge to go Lee Sin support is powerful, just like that urge to jump into a 1v5 just because you can. What you need to do is Resist! Resist the demon on your shoulder and do what is best for the team WHICH IS PLAY AN ACTUAL FUCKING SUPPORT!\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nPS: Im not even an ADC player I&#039;m a mid laner, I&#039;m just sick of Lee Sin &#039;supports&#039; all round.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-06-21T13:15:51.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well a good Lee Sin support will just build full tank + some support items, focus on tanking and insecing. \n\nBut most Lee Sin supports just build full AD because they can't be bothered picking someone more \"supportish\" sigh\n\nOf course the best Lee supports build full ap lee song, but that's besides the point.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-21T13:36:49.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"While this is true.\nA good Lee Sin will never be as good a support as a good Thresh or Braum or Nami of the same calibre, no matter how good their insecing is.\n\nJust as the good Nami players will never be as good at assassinating as the good Lee Sin players.\n\nWhile the meta isn't everything, it exists because it works.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-06-21T14:12:34.193+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Challenge accepted jungle assassin Nami.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-06-21T16:36:17.610+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that I'd really like to see.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-21T23:17:35.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Find out what the average Lee Sin jungle score is, and if you beat it as jungle Nami.

That should already give you a REALLY big hint about wether he is an assassin or a support.\n\nBut if that isn't enough of a hint, lets spell it out:\n\nLee Sin can make 1 epic play every 300 seconds. (But if he decides to do it without flash and usually botch it, he can make 1 epic play every 90 seconds.)\n\n1 support ability per 90 seconds, isn't really that great. \nWhere thresh can make 7.5 pulls in that time, and 10 flays, (more if he has CRD, which he always does) \nNami can land 9 bubbles and heal you 9 times (not to mention speeding you up and enhancing your auto attacks.)\nBlitz can pull you 6 times knock you up 18 times, and silence you 3 times. \n\nAsk any good ADC, if they prefer 1 knock back every 90 seconds, or 6 pulls and 18 knock ups with 3 silences. I can Guarantee you what their answer will be.\n\nNot to mention that supports actually put their wards in useful places like... i dunno.. the bush or the river! Lee Sin always puts his wards smack bang in the middle of the lane, and refuses to use them anywhere else because 'i need them for w' which does no-one any good at all. \n\nPlus Lee Sin always has a huge lead, and tank Lee Sin still does more damage than most AD champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Buttsubushi","date":"2016-06-22T00:49:41.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Notice how {{champion:1}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:161}}  don't say \"support\" in the client either?

They aren't proper supports, very few proper support mains would pick them over actual supports with heals and shields and boosts.\n\nNaught is good but not as good as thresh or one of those others, he is far better in the jungle. His pull is slow, wide (so it hits minions a lot) and not as effective as thresh/blitz.\n\nBlitz unlike the others you mentioned, was made specifically for a duo lane, why it doesn't say support in the client i don't know (maybe its the same reason it calls Azir a marksman)\n\nall your options there involve his ult, its his only major support ability. even with 3 points in it and full CDR (which you are definitely not going to get in the laning phase (when your ADC needs you most)) its still not up as much as other actual supports abilities.\n\nIts good when it hits sure, but if you were in a war zone, would you rather have a big gun with 1 shot, or a smaller gun with a full magazine?\n\nLee isn't constrained by mana no, neither is Zed, does that make Zed a good support?\n\nAny way you look at it, Lee Sin is not as good or consistent as proper supports, (if he was it would be a proper meta pick, and it isn't.)

I've had great success with support {{champion:64}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:202}}  and none of them a considered meta supports, but the reason they work is because I mastered them and played both adc and support long enough to know how to use their kits properly in the supporting role. I wouldn't play any of these (or my ADC {{champion:157}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:4}} ) in ranked because it is already a stressful environment, and I can't convince my team how they are strong with me playing them, even though they are off-meta.\n\nOnce you have mastered a champion, and main another role, you will know whether or not they will work in an off-meta role.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-22T03:22:30.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If only everyone else shared your restraint with ranked.\n\nIve dealt with everything in normals **and** ranked, one guy even tried to convince us that Zed Support was OP.\nHe got something like 14/5/3 or something and said \"i told you so\" not realising that a score like that makes you a BAD support.\n\nIve had Xin's Zed's Lee's, even a draven once (like wheres the logic in that?) And thats times when I've been playing ADC (which is not very often at all) \n\nSupports like Illaoi, technically aren't supports because none of their abilities actually 'support' the other player, sure you do a lot of damage and heal _yourself_ lots, but apart from a short slow that takes ages to implement. None of your abilities contribute in any way to supporting your ADC, (unless you just stand there and be a meat shield) youre just another damage source that is just less effective than if you played Top illaoi.\n\nJhin has a very short snare and a slow that is very hard to hit in combat situations. His ult could work as a great chasing tool, but the problems are that you need to be OUT of the fight to use it, and if you are out of the fight, it means that your ADC (the once you are supposed to be protecting) is in essentially a 2v1 situation. which is less than ideal. He also lacks any boosts/heals/shields.\n\nYas ADC is a hot topic, i personally don't like it anywhere near me, but apart from being melee, he fits the bill okay. He just gets harassed very easily in a lane where harass is a game-changing issue.\n\nJayce is much less efficient ADC, he relies on too many abilities to just sit there and Auto attack (which is where most of the ADC's damage comes from) so you can build full AD Jayce, and have your abilities do a lot of damage, but then lack the high sustained damage needed to melt tanks. \nBut if you build crit Jayce you have the sustained damage, but your abilities become so much less effective (and they are bloody good abilities, so its a shame) and your tiny AA range makes you easy pray for Catlin/Tristana/Jhin etc.\n\nTF ADC is okay, apart from his Q all his abilities synergise well with auto attacking, and if you have a couple of AP hybrid items like rage blade and gun blade or something your E might not be completely useless. But its still better to have an AP one, I've got AP TF doing 2000 with 1 AA, so why give that up to do 2000 with 4 AA's on AD TF?\n\nOff-meta champs are fun, I've played AP varus, attack speed bard and all that crap and its hilariously fun, the unfortunate thing is that its fine if you're by yourself in a solo lane, that way when you feed Zed, its on you, but when you're in a lane with an ADC (who wants to play properly) you end up ruining their time. \n\nand then worst of all, someone sees you doing well playing an off meta champ and thinks \"thats OP! I'm going to go do all my ranked games with this easy win champ!\"  and we all know how that turns out...","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Buttsubushi","date":"2016-06-21T23:54:34.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something like is is what I get on support Lee:\n{{champion:64}} {{item:2045}} {{item:3401}} {{item:3190}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3083}} \n(then you have 3 shields to put on your ADC)\n\nSpecific items can change from game to game but basically {{item:2049}}  + 40% CDR + full tank is what Lee supports should be always building towards.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-22T00:23:41.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thresh can build that same thing and still have 3 shields, PLUS hooks, flays and ult slows\n\nthere is nothing lee sin can do as a support, that a real support cant do better.","replies":[{"poster":"Buttsubushi","date":"2016-06-22T00:43:46.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But Lee is way more fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-22T01:43:20.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lee is like Zed, he's a champ that 'feels' tricky and makes the players think they they are good, when really its just recycling the same combos over and over again. \nLee has 1 combo, Q (ward) W R Q E E W All other combos are just less effective versions of that one.\n\nWhen they start playing actual Tricky champs like Azir/Syndra/Sol/etc etc, who cant just press R or W to instantly exit the fight, they start to realise they arent actually as good as they thought and go back to playing Lee/Zed\n(thats why those actual tricky champs have low pick rates, and Zed/Lee etc have high pick rates)","replies":[{"poster":"Buttsubushi","date":"2016-06-22T02:22:29.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:134}} {{champion:136}}  = tricky? \n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} \nem, ok.\n\nHave you actually played Lee?

Lose the art of how to position themselves.\n\nWhen you can play Aurelion Sol, hitting THE RIGHT enemies with every star, not taking enough damage to kill/force you out of the fight, AND being in a spot where you can easily retreat if someone goes full tilt on you, requires far far far more thought about positioning than just pressing R spamming all your spells and pressing R again like Zed does. THEN you have good positioning.\n\nIf you are lee and you find yourself out of position, you can Q over the wall to gromp or dragon or just to minions, or you can W to a nearby ally, or to minions Or even to a fucking ward that you place yourself, and if they are still on you, you can ult them away, not to mention that you have a powerful AOE slow to help put some distance between you and them.\n\nIf you are Sol and you find yourself out of position. **You die**. \nThats the fact. Your only defensive ability is your ult, and anyone with a dash (or if you are slowed) can recover from that displacement relatively easily. Your Q doesn't even work within your inner circle of stars, so when a Yi or Xin or Zed etc is on you, its game over.\n\nAurelion Sol has 0% margin for mistakes, if you are slightly out of position, you burst your ult and or flash, and or die.\n\nif you are Lee you have 3 abilities to help you escape before you even need to think about using your ult (and god forbid you should ever need to flash) \n\nLee has a far higher margin for mistakes.\n\nLets not forget that this is the Assassin meta, where assassins are in their prime and are most effective.\nLee is an Assassin, he is in his element right now. Sol is vulnerable to anything that has something resembling a dash or move-speed boost, and the definition of Assassin is they they are the most manoeuvrable champions with multiple engages/escapes.\n\nSo tell me, is it trickier to play a champion that forgives mistakes such as bad positioning in a meta that is designed to suit him and make him powerful? Or is it tricker to play a champion that has 0% error margin in a meta where the things that are your most natural counter are at their most powerful and abundant?\n\nIn any case, this is not a pissing contest between Sol and Lee, both have disadvantages and advantages, and neither are support champions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tons of Segs","date":"2016-06-21T12:42:10.776+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good to see someone has the right idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-06-22T00:15:43.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but how do i make my dank silver lee sin montage xd\n\nleesin support is op ur just a hater!!1!","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-06-22T00:48:51.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mesprit,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=L3cAMgwq,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-06-22T00:15:43.899+0000)\n>\n> but how do i make my dank silver lee sin montage xd\n> \n> leesin support is op ur just a hater!!1!\n\nEcs dee keppo","replies":[{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-06-22T01:12:59.356+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wuks,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=L3cAMgwq,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-06-22T00:48:51.732+0000)\n>\n> Ecs dee keppo\n\nwuks i thought i banned you from saying anything except your copypaste macros","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-06-22T03:23:10.091+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow!
