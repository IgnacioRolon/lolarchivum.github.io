Grouping into them is like spitting in Batman&#039;s face, its going to put you in hospital.\r\n\r\nLook at our team: Fiora, Kled, Taliyah, Sona and Ashe.\r\n\r\nWe have less tanks. Fiora (the one wanting to group) excels at focusing down a single target not a whole team, Taliyah is less effective in an all-out brawl like this where she cant focus the back line. Kled is our only true engage and the only one able to take hits, and the two champions who are best for grouping in our team are Sona and Ashe neither of which are doing well atm. \r\n\r\nThere are more tactics other than grouping, so rather than just blurting out the first tactic that comes to mind and treating is at gospel, actually pause for a moment and consider the other options: Fiora and Taliyah are great split pushers AND we have stone drag. While the others can ward up, keep the enemies distracted or farm up the jungle and secure objectives. \r\n\r\nJust take a moment to think about the situation, fighting 5v5 isn&#039;t always the best idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-08-13T00:20:34.347+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah totally agree. In low elo a lot of times grouping is hailed as the only possible viable strategy. \n\nTBH I think split pushing works the best for low elo games. People find it really hard to deal with tanks and AD duelists unless they bring 3+ players.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-08-13T03:22:06.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just played a game, we had 3 banner of commands, 3 ZZ'Rots, only 1 tank and we sieged with Heimerdinger.

When I've got all turrets in my lane, I'll do mid or bot.\n\nIts very often I'll get flamed or spam pinged (danger, fallback, danger, fallback) because I'm pushing solo.\n\nI find Garen to be a very good distraction in lane pushing especially mid-late game.\nHe has great mobility, can take a heap of damage, and can push turrets and waves up quite fast. He is just annoying for their team if you persist (somewhat safely ofcourse) in keeping lanes pushed.\n\nBut even when team fights weren't working, and I decide to switch it up and lane push, I could have the lowest death rate (with good kill participation) and still get blamed for a loss because I \"didn't group\".\n\nI completely agree, some just don't use champions to their potential when the\" go to\" tactic is failing.","replies":[]}]}
