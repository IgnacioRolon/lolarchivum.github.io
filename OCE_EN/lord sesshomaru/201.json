Fizz is one such champion.\n\nSo if anyone can give me real solid advice _(with reasoning)_ on how to play against Fizz, I would be very appreciative.\n\nThese are some situations vsing Fizz, where I genuinely have no idea what I could have done, _(not even to win, but just to avoid dying)_:\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/238490400\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/195443549\n\nIf someone could tell me what I should be doing in these situations.\nIm trying to play safe. In the Sol example, he and I were even in score _(from memory)_ and I was slightly ahead in CS. and despite this, I am ONLY farming with my stars at their max limit, I&#039;m not even coming close enough to the wave to auto attack, I&#039;m literally as far away from the lane as I can be while still getting farm, using up mana just to get CS. I don&#039;t know how much safer you can play? Except just not farming.\n\nFor the first Xerath example, I was actually ahead of him _(pretty sure i got first blood on him)_, I even had a level on him, I&#039;m poking him where I can _(at long range I might add)_ I&#039;m only getting caster minions with my abilities so as to keep as far away as possible. after he throws his ult, I land both my slow and my stun _(at nearly max range, so its a long stun)_ on him, he dodges neither and still reaches me with no effort at all. When he does reach me, even if I had any abilities up, I wouldn&#039;t be able to do anything as Im either knocked up, or he is untargetable.\n\nIn the second Xerath example, I&#039;m under my tower trying to punish Kench for getting some cheeky tower hits off. Fizz engages on me from a distance that most ranged champs wouldn&#039;t even be a threat from, and pretty much the entire time he is under the tower, either I am airborne, or he is untargetable.\nHe tower dives with no minions at all, gets a kill on someone from full HP, and escapes basically at full health himself. What is the counterplay for that?\n\nLook at the range that he can engage comfortably at:\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/c127bbb52471287c9f6113bf1f6a4a88.png\n\nHes a squishy melee assassin _(but we all know the &#039;squishy&#039; part is a lie)_, and I&#039;m literally the **artillery** champ, and yet only one of my abilities would even come close to hitting him at that distance.\nHonestly, what should I have done? Tahm was under tower, and Fizz was half a lane away, should I just think _&quot;Nah fizz is somewhere in mid lane, ill just abandon the tower!&quot;_?\n\n\n**What should I do?** \nPlease tell me, Ive been playing this game for 6 years and I just have absolutely no idea.\nWhat is the counterplay?\n\nim not even interested in winning against fizz, I gave up on that years ago, alI want is just to not die, but somehow still keep myself in the game gold wise.\n\nWhen I play a roaming champ like Sol, I will roam every chance I get just to keep me out of mid lane, but Fizz is a really good roamer too, and for every assist I get when I roam, he gets a kill somewhere else _(or even on me in the same lane when he follows)_.\nBut sometimes Im not playing a roaming champ and have little choice but to stay in mid.\n\nOne of the main problems is: \nIt takes Fizz such a short amount of time to kill you, and from such a long range, and for 40% of that time you are airborne, and for 50% of it, he is untargetable. How do you counterplay that?\n\nLike what range should I farm at?\nObviously I can&#039;t stand close to him because... well, that requires standing close to him.\nand obviously I cant stand far away because his ult becomes so debilitating.\nPlease, help me.\n\n________________\nNow it&#039;s hypocritical of me to ask for advice and then shoot down answers when they come in, but I&#039;m not above saying that some advice just isn&#039;t worth giving in the first place.\n\nUnhelpful answers:\n\n1. **Git gud.**\nHahaha very funny, good contribution, such help, much wow. Ill try that next time.\n\n2. **Just play X champ! they shit on Fizz.**\nThis is unhelpful, there is a difference between &#039;counterplay&#039; and &#039;counterpicking&#039;, and until we have draft pick up at all times, there will be occasions where I play against Fizz as someone other than X champ. I refuse to believe that it is impossible to beat Fizz unless you play as X champ, so therefore I&#039;m not interested in answers that dictate what champs I have to play in an environment where I have no guarantee that Ill even be vsing a fizz. I have a solid pool of around 14ish mid laners that I am well practiced and experienced with that I will usually fall back on when I&#039;m not trying out new champs, and if there isn&#039;t a single champ in there that stands a chance against Fizz, then perhaps thats a sign that it&#039;s time for a nerf!\n\n3. **Just dodge the shark brah, eeeeeasy!**\nFunny you should mention this, because this thought has actually occurred to me. The problem here is that this is a game of skill and sometimes my skill at dodging is better than his skill at throwing, and sometimes it&#039;s the other way round. The shark is a small fast particle with a large hitbox, it has no channel and no visual or audio effects that herald that he is about to throw it, and it has a range large enough that unlike Blitz/Thresh, it isn&#039;t obvious when he is positioning himself for the throw. So sometimes I can dodge it, and sometimes my reactions just aren&#039;t fast enough. Obviously I will try wherever possible to avoid the shark, just as I would any other ability from any other champ. This advice is just as helpful as: _**&quot;Its easy to win; just don&#039;t lose&quot;**_. Plus he has enough damage even without the shark to decimate the HP of any non-tank, so the shark isn&#039;t even essential most of the time.\n\nIm not sure if it exists, but if it does, I&#039;m really looking for a good solid explanation of what to do against Fizz _(with a focus on laning phase)_, explaining why this helps. and what I should have done in the situations above to avoid dying.\n\nIf anyone can help me get better here, I would be very appreciative :)","replies":[{"poster":"MysticLlama","date":"2017-10-17T01:09:01.480+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't find you on oce.op.gg \"Lord Sesshomaru\" \nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Lord%20Sesshomaru\nDid you name change i can provide some tips if i have some more stats.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-10-17T01:38:54.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-10-17T01:58:45.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah i see you are level 10....\nok then basically you need to take barrier vs fizz 100% and your main objective it to get him to use E.

This technique, however, will be negated somewhere between mid-late game because of all the CDR he buys. Try to shit on him so he can't get his power spike from Lich Bane. Poke him hard, deny him farm, stall him from getting any items.\n\nAnother technique you can use is punishing his engage. You could outburst him if he uses his E to engage, similarly to how Talon uses ult when Zed comes out of his. You could also disengage him or CC chain him\n\nJust my 2 cents","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-10-17T01:06:23.914+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I assume \"Ban the fishy bastard\" is also unhelpful advice? :P","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-10-17T05:51:53.520+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be good advice, if I could get over my compulsive Lee Sin ban addiction. :P","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-10-17T08:00:34.465+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh that is a conundrum.

He has no other defining trait like Master Yi or Talon. He has absolutly no pushing potential or he risks using his damage and escape ability. That's what you need to exploit. If you're playing Xertah, for example, you outrange him during all points of the game. You outrange his ult, so don't you dare give me that. However, you should not be picking Xerath into Fizz, and if it was him that picked into you, then that sucks. But you can counter him easily.\n\nBarrier is your friend. Do not run cleanse against a Fizz as you wouldn't get out of his ult in time, regardless. Zhonyas works, too, if you lack mobility. If you can avoid his ult, Fizz will not go in and that will give you a major advantage for 60 seconds.\n\nDo not sit at max range, either. His ult at close range barely sratches you.","replies":[]}]}
