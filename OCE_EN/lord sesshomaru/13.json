While most other champs (namely fighters, assassins and marksmen) can work well with many keystone runes from multiple pages.\r\n\r\nTake Jhin for example, pretty much every non-resolve rune is at least _viable_ on him. The same with most fighters. Many top laners take Aery for the harass, and forget completely about the trees that were designed around top laners. Yet mages may as well not take any runes at all if they cant have either sorcery runes or electrocute. Hardly a balanced equation.\r\n\r\nWhy can runes like Aery and arcane comet have _adaptive damage_ and be activated by _auto attacks_, but runes like press the attack or fleet footwork cant be activated by abilities, and have no AP friendly component.\r\n\r\nIf you look at runes in general, they **HEAVILY** favour auto attacking champs, over ability based ones.\r\nShouldn&#039;t we be adding new runes for them? Not giving the ones they already had to the assassins and marksmen?\r\n\r\n\r\n_____________\r\n\r\n\r\nLets break the keystones _(the main reason we choose a tree)_ down into 3 categories:\r\n\r\n#**Purely auto attack reliant:**\r\nPress the attack\r\nLethal Tempo\r\nFleet footwork\r\nConqueror\r\nDark Harvest\r\nHail of Blades\r\nGrasp of the Undying\r\nGlacial Augment\r\n\r\n\r\n#**Purely ability reliant:**\r\nAftershock\r\nGuardian\r\n\r\n\r\n#**Either:**\r\nElectrocute\r\nPredator\r\nSummon Aery\r\nArcane Comet\r\nPhase Rush\r\nKleptomancy\r\nUnsealed spell book.\r\n\r\n\r\n_____________\r\nLook a little bias to you? \r\nNote too how the purely ability reliant ones, aren&#039;t even for champs who use their abilities for damage, theyre both from the tanky/support tree.\r\n\r\nLike really....\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Stillborn","date":"2018-06-01T04:55:18.326+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everytime I see you post, you're crying about something.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-06-01T05:46:23.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Doesn't that just prove how far from the mark this game's balance is?\n\nWhen the game is **_perfect_**.
