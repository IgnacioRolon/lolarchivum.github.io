(not to mention you have other things on your mind in that situation) Its rare enough to be facing your lore rival in lane, lets not put anymore restrictions on it. being realistic the only times you use the &#039;ctrl 2&#039; taunt is before the minions spawn to entertain yourself, or to spam in lane at a safe distance, neither of which allows for listening to the special taunts as it stands. and most people actually type out &#039;/taunt&#039; not sure why, but they do, so good luck getting within Xeraths AA range and then doing some typing, to play a quote you wont even hear over the sound of his abilities. The range should ideally be that if you can see both champions on your screen the special taunts will work, or at very least be the range of a nid spear.\r\nplease consider this. i love the lore interactions and its rare to have the opportunity to play some of the awesome quotes.\r\n\r\nalso it would be great to have more champs like tahm who can taunt allied champions to play special lines, thats better altogether because when you are all sitting around to leash the jungler you ahem something to do.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-09-06T08:38:16.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Easter Eggs are not supposed to be a part of the game, but only as a bonus.\n\nYou can read not a single character from lore and still play the game fine, nor is Riot actively trying to push lore knowledge onto the players. Hence champ interactions is generally reserved for friends/people having fun together, trying to discover little details hidden inside the game.\n\nThat's also why 1 of the only 2 champ events are nearly impossible to trigger if you don't already have knowledge of it and the people to stage it.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-09-06T11:00:02.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not really an easter egg, its just interaction between characters, you wouldnt play assassins creed and not have any noticeable change in language/behavior when the good guy meets his arch nemesis. Hell even the latest Naruto game has special quotes from Naruto to sasuke, or Kakashi to obito etc after the fight. and that game is nothing compared with the vastness of lol. The champion interaction should be accessible for when you want to use it. \n\n\"nor is riot actively trying to push lore onto players\" hence disabling gangplank for a week (which affects gameplay) for no other reason than because he 'died' in lore. completly re-vamping a whole map, soundtracks, voice announcer etc. it was impossible for people who didn't want to be part of the lore to play an aram without being part part of it. you couldnt play 5v5 without new music and pirates talking to you. (don't get me wrong i loved that stuff, but its certainly not 'reserved' for friends/people having fun together.) also having a kha with all 4 evolution points coming at you affects gameplay ever so slightly too. there isn't a choice for someone who doesn't care about lore to ignore the 4th evolution, he has to deal with it regardless.\n\nalso both of the champ events happen fairy easily, you dont need to stage rengar and kha being on opposite teams or to have ashe vs sej or ashe vs liss or liss vs sej. sure it wont happen if you dont get enough kills but several times I've been playing and the frejliord event has started and i have completely forgotten that it happens if you have those champs together, i even won the crown the other day actually. and the rengar/kha one happens far more often that that one.\n\nin any case it doesn't hurt anyone to have champions say their quotes (remember you have to actively press buttons for this, its doesn't happen by itself) while slightly further away from each other.","replies":[]}]}]}
