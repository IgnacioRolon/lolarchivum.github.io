With the release of runes reforged top lane has been hit really hard, mostly because of bruisers not been able to fit in with the current runes really well. As someone who plays a lot of bruisers and toplane, I've been really struggling to win my lane because the enemy will usually pick a tank with aftershock and end up out damaging me. They even stated in the video that they were working on making a new rune for the resolve path to help fit with the bruiser class. They aren't as op right now as you think, it's probably just the tankiness which is overwhelming.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-01-21T02:02:57.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.gyazo.com/db84b55cdfb5340e94c3b28fc8ac42cc.png\n\nIm afraid I cant see top laner's being disadvantaged when Jax builds pretty much tank, and out-damage everyone on both teams.\nHe also had klepto, not even a damage rune.\n\nBut I agree, there are champs than can use any rune they want and be strong, and then champs that don't really work well with any of them. That needs to be fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2018-01-21T02:49:03.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jax only has 2 proper tank items in that build? I wouldn't see that as building \"full tank\" and out damaging everyone. You also have to take into account that he is super fed and a super fed jax late game is a monster. Just like *cough* vayne *cough*. Jax is a special exception though because Press the Attack happens to be good on him since he utilises attack speed so much unlike most of the other bruisers top.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-01-21T06:20:09.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He got fed _somehow_ remember, he didn't just magically 'become fed' and then started building items.\n\nMy point is that he only has one proper 'pure damage' item, and thats gun-blade. Like JasonWazza says, tri force does give damage but it is still a half tank item. Not to mention Deadmans, Spirit Visage and Sterak's are for the most part **tanky** items. And he built defensive boots instead of offensive ones too, indicating his intention of going tanky instead of pure damage. \n\nSo apart from gun blade, all of his items have very strong defensive capabilities.\nYet he was wayyyy outclassing Jhin and Tristana despite them both building 4+ pure damage items each.\n\nSo what im trying to say is that if you want to build items that make you harder to kill _(Sterak's, Deadmans, Spirit, etc)_ then you should have to sacrifice damage. But he doesn't. He can build these items which gives him basically 4k HP, and still be on par with Jhin or Trist's damage despite them having to sacrifice any defences at all just to get enough damage.\n\n\n__________\n\n**In conclusion, what i'm trying to say is:**\nIf you want to do enough damage to be a hyper carry, you should have to actually build full damage like ADC's have to do.\nAnd if you want to be tanky enough to actually function as a meat shield, you should have to sacrifice damage to reach that level of survivability.\n\nJax _(and other champs like Udyr, Warwick Renekton, Darius etc)_ dont have to compromise, they get enough damage to be a massive threat, but enough tankiness that you often can't afford to _(or straight up **can't**)_ focus them over other targets.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2018-01-21T06:44:58.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But you see the thing is Renekton, Darius, jax and other bruisers top lane aren't really that bad compared to tanks like Maokai and Ornn with aftershock. Both of those champions actually end up out-damaging everyone else top while building purely FULL TANK. It's the kind of logic that shouldn't make sense, but has existed since the days of tank ekko and fizz. Ornn has now actually become a perma ban of mine, because no matter how hard I try, how safe I play, how much help I get from my jungler, the fucker never dies, he 1v2's so easily. Riven + Udyr against an ornn, who do you think would win? Surely not ornn, but he did, absolutely pulverised both of us. He maxes W and you can't get anywhere near your minions without losing half your health. And what do they choose to nerf? The unstoppable bit of his w, not the actual bullshit damage it does for someone who builds purely tank. At least being tanky and dealing a lot of damage with someone like Darius or jax makes sense, playing someone like ornn and having a sunfire cape and out damaging a bruiser doesn't.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-01-21T07:57:57.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree 100%\n\nBuilding tank, should mean that you are very very hard to kill, and it takes you a long long time to kill someone else.\n\nBut as it stands, tanks live long enough to kill squishies like mages and ADC's before said squishes can deal enough damage to get rid of the tanks, and quite frankly, squishies shouldn't have to worry about tanks.\n\nSquishies should have to keep an eye out for Zed or Fizz making a b-line for them, they shouldn't have to worry about Ornn or Jax stampeding over the whole team to get them.\n\nAdmittedly I dont see much of Ornn in my games, and when there is one, being a mid main I don't have to deal with him in lane much _(but I am aware of the unkillable part, unless im Azir I cant ever seem to have enough damage to do anything to him, especially not as Taliyah,)_\n\nIn a perfect world the ultimate balance would that a full build tank and a full build ADC should take exactly the same time to kill eachother. One does a lot of damage to a very sturdy target, and the other does very minimal damage to a very squishy target. \nBut as it stands right now, they both do massive damage to eachother, but one has 3x more HP...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-21T05:24:52.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the issue tends to be the 1/2 \"damage\" item tanks (triforce is still half a tank item, and BotRK/Gunblade are sustain)\n\nThey deal too much damage, and can easily go \"tank\" for the rest of their items (I mean tank in that they do have stats that go to tankiness, even though things like Sterak's give damage, they are still a tank item in practice.)\n\nJax is probably the main issue for this subset either way because he is the main one that abuses gunblade hard enough for it to be an issue.
