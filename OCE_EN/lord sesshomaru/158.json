Now I have to complain about something else.\n\nHonestly, why do we even need item sets? It's not like theirs a large variety of items that you can use. All champions build the same things, no matter what. Sick balance on that, by the way. Also, why add a useless feature onto the already buggy and trash client? The new client has so many issues that should be fixed rather than adding a feature that 0.5% of people will use.\n\nBetter yet, why not fix the damn item list in-game and place 'Ability power' at the top of the magic list where it should be. It's been out of order for ages and this triggers me. Better yet, again, why not fix the entire in-game shop so it doesn't look like it was made for a MUD? Jesus.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-06-01T02:04:39.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whooo Item sets....I never really used them but I can see their usefulness.
