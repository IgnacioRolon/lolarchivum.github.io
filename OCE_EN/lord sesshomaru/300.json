In the [announcement post](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales/were-changing-discounts) they said this:\n\n+ _\"Bringing all of our skins onto the same early sale schedule means there will no longer be a launch sale for 1350s and Ultimates starting in the new year\"_\n\nYou also said that 1820 RP skins used to have initial discounts, but I'm 99% sure this never happened. Even in the same 'early sales' announcement they say:\n\n+ _\"We also want players to have a chance to get a deal on skins of any tier, which conflicts with the fact that **we previously didnâ€™t discount legendary skins (1820s)**. So we're making future Legendary skins eligible for the early sale...\"_\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-11-30T01:55:54.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Project Yi was discounted 1 week after release _(but you didnt get the border)_\nim certain they used to have discounts..\n\nAlso, im not a fan of the early sales..

They added this new tier price, but it was like they were worried players would hate them, so they made it that every 1350RP skin would be 975RP for a short while after release. \n\n\nThat basically means most people were buying all those 1350RP skins at 975RP. I know not all people bought the skins at that time, but people are pretty desperate to get skins at release *cough* Lux skin *cough*. \n\nSo yeah it's most likely money, but also the people working on these skins, some 1350RP skins are pretty close to the 1820RP tier, say Santa Braum for example, that just needs voice lines and it's ready to go, he rides a sleigh when homeguard boost! So much work has gone into it. It would be sad if most of the LoL players bought that for 975RP straight up.\n\nI'm really just putting a different perception because I do know games like League of Legends are money hungry, but yeah. Also, with the change they made, they made it so legendary skins would go on sale now, so that was like a plus to all this sale change. Especially since they come out more often than Ultimate skins.","replies":[]}]}
