There have been countless other times, but they all drone into one painful event, much like the game in general these days.\n\n___________________\n\n**The first time.**\n\nI was Yorick, fighting it out in top lane, I won lane and kept him at bay for most of the game _(which you would assume would count for something at least, but apparently not?)_. While I was pushing, he decided to turn and fight me. From max range he hit me with his slow instigating the engage, so I put my wall around him, didn&#039;t slow him down at all _(because someone decided: why not give Nasus&#039; items attack speed? that wont be unnecessary at all.)_ So long before his slow had ended he had broken free of the wall and was on top of me, I slapped him with my Q transferring the dead mans slow to him. Then his slow ended, and I picked up speed, throwing my slow back at him. Whaddayaknow, i&#039;m hit wiht his slow again, **less** than 2 seconds after it ended... \n\nHe caught up to me again, and this time I had nothing _(because I have ACTUAL cooldowns, not token ones)_. Luckily our innocent Zoe turned up and thought a now oom Yorick on low HP with everything on cooldown, and a _burst mage_ could take a Nasus. So she got 1 hit and her untimely demise gave me enough time to waddle to freedom to deal with my newly acquired ptsd.\n\n\n_____________________\n\n**The second time.**\n\nNow, Azir is not known for his lack of mobility, as sustained mages go, there are probably none that can match his level of disengage. \nMyself and our ADC were attacking a mid lane tower, the tower only had a couple of hits left on it, unfortunately a Nasus turned up yo defend, I decided to stay and get off the extra 2 autos on the tower, once the tower was destroyed, Nasus was upon me, 3/4 of my health was gone in one attack and he hit me with his slow. I ulted him off towards his base, and shurima shuffled away towards mine, also hitting him with my Q slow with a seperate soldier. By the time his slow had ended, he was standing on top of me, and cleaved the bird&#039;s head from its shoulders. \n_(im sure I probably flashed as well, but I cant remember it, so I wont include it)_\n\nHere are Nasus&#039; stats:\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/99646cc646aeedc6d267298241e21e8c.png\n\nHere are Azir&#039;s:\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/e13e5f2af943950b092ddf24b7a02a42.png\n\nNow im no maths wizard, but I know the basic equation:  **0 &lt; 2**\nSo one would assume that someone with 2 bars of mobility should be able to escape someone with 0, after they use literally every ability in their kit. As opposed to just the 1 ability the person with 0 mobility used.\n\n________________________\n\n\n**The third time.**\n\nI was playing Sivir, and foolish me believed the trolls online that say Nasus&#039; weakness is being kited. \nSo with my ult active, and hitting him with Q procing my passive, AND even spell shielding the slow _(do you know the prediction and timing you have to have to block a targetable ability with no cast time, without wasting it on the other abilities flying around the place?)_ He still walked towards me at a pace where I couldn&#039;t stop to auto attack him becasue if I did pause to send even one attack at him, I would have been smashed. Of course in the end I was hit with another slow, this time without the spell shield, and that was the end. \n\n\n_________________________\n\nNow I feel like, if you are an unstoppable monster with infinitely scaling damage and 20% passive lifesteal on that infinitely scaling damage, maybe you shouldn&#039;t have a death sentence slow _(lets be real its basically a snare)_ with a 1.6 second cooldown.  Just maybe, that was a bad idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Iudex Gundyr","date":"2018-02-02T00:53:14.194+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"He's a Juggernaut with a weaker laning phase. He sucks at team fighting unless you inted him. In your examples, you effectively tried to 1v1 him.\n\nYour Azir example, he already had 11 kills, with a full movement speed build, and you didn't even have finished boots. Not only that, he was high enough level to have put many points in his W to secure kills on the underfed Azir. No shit you won't out run him, especially with the fact you were only 2 mid. You're in Nasus' playground. Don't feed him and be with 5 people and see how useless he becomes relative to other champions in the game.\n\nThe Sivir game. If you truly did do what you said you did (e his w, etc), you would have escaped. He ONLY had triforce for movement speed and didn't even have finished boots. The only way he catches you is if you try to kite and 1v1 him which is obviously a terrible idea since you were 0/2 (or worse) and held a strong 5 cs per minute the entire game, whilst he was fed/getting fed. You don't kill him so by turning back and kiting, you're just staying in his range and asking for death once his W is back up. \n\nAlso, there is no Yorick vs Nasus match up on your entire match history (according to op.gg) so I can't really comment on it other than say why are you trying to fight a mid game Nasus lmao.\n\nPlus, Azir does have better mobility than Nasus. \n\nMobility is the ability to move freely/fast. The more mobility a champion has, the faster they can move around the map. That is why Azir is over Nasus. Nasus has 0 abilities that help his mobility. Azir has e, q. Just because Nasus can SLOW a champions mobility, doesn't mean his is higher. Just because he W's someone in a teamfight, doesn't mean that he is now Lee Sin level with jumps and speed. \n\nEvery champion in this game has the ability to be built full movement speed. For Nasus, it synergises with his kit. That doesn't mean that his base mobility is good though. He is a melee champion with no jumps or speed ups. He is as immobile as it comes. \n\nYou are mixing definitions up my friend.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2018-02-02T05:38:15.330+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> He&#x27;s a Juggernaut with a weaker laning phase. He sucks at team fighting unless you inted him. In your examples, you effectively tried to 1v1 him.\n\nI've mained top lane for 4 years and I can tell you that nasus is a champion where even if you poke him down to the point where he is under his tower, he will still just farm up stacks and heal back his health from the free lifesteal he gets in his kit. No matter what you do, a good nasus will just sit top and farm stacks under his tower as long as he needs. Also nasus doesn't suck at team fighting, I've been 0/2 and easily 1v3'd with only a tri force. That's all nasus needs since in his ult he is incredibly powerful. Free health, free armor/magic resit, and 50% cd on q, he can shred through most of the enemy team himself. He does not need to be fed, he just needs to know how to sit under tower and hit stacks when he's losing.\n\nYou're mixing up your information my friend.","replies":[{"poster":"Iudex Gundyr","date":"2018-02-03T11:40:35.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well if you're silver level of course you're not going to know how to vs/play around him. \n\nYou can shit on him and zone him in laning on many champs. Trundle, Jayce, Rengar, GP, Illaoi, Camille etc. 10% lifesteal of 80-110 damage hits really isn't much when you take 80+ damage an auto attack and are able to be traded on and forced on 50% of the cs you try to last hit specifically when versing ranged matchups. You also can't really defend yourself from ganks due to no mobility. Your R is nice but it can be eaten through by competent opponents before you're able to do anything. \n\nIn teamfights Nasus is effectively a bruiser/juggernaut. Doesn't provide anywhere near as much cc/survivability as someone like Maokai, but deals more single target damage. Which means against 5 people, he generally can't teamfight that well because he gets kited and dies very fast and is unable to burst out damage. No matter how tanky you are, a 4-5 item mid + adc combo is going to shred you in a few seconds max. Nasus can't get to them without sacrificing proper tank item slots, which just makes him completely one shottable and even if he does get in range, jungler and support can peel, and mid/adc can just use items or summs to kill, or just tank it cause he doesn't deal that much damage unless he gets fed off bad players. \n\nIn games 40 mins + in length. His win ratio is a gigantic 51.2%. Talk about infinite scaling am I right?\n\nNasus isn't that good. His laning is bad. His teamfighting is bad. There are simply better champions in the game unless your top/jg is autofill/bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2018-02-03T12:53:08.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol using my rank as an excuse to assume my game level knowledge, do you main top?

He doesn't need to be fighting the enemy laner, cs and stacks guarantee a win for nasus later in the game. Also the heal is op if you're not taking constant damage, only an idiot would let that happen. You can defend yourself against ganks if one of the two people running at you has a 90% slow and won't likely get to you by the time you're under tower. You're right, nasus in teamfights doesn't really provide any cc, but survivability???? Like I said his ultimate gives him MORE HEALTH, MORE DEFENCES and a lower cd on q to allow him to heal more from his attacks. Nasus has A LOT of survivability. You're also right about him only doing single-target damage, but nasus does not get kited easily lmao remember again he has a 90% SLOW, you use that on the adc and you've got them. If you build cdr its pretty much up by the time it ends so you have a perma slow, no ones kiting you anywhere. Also nasus unable to burst out damage??? Do you forget with enough stacks and tri force you can two shot people?? Have you literally never seen a GOOD nasus with a GOOD amount of stacks before EVER??? I have played with nasus enough to know that you only need a single triforce as your damage item then you can build full tank and with enough stacks you can both completely shred through people and soak up a ton of damage. Sure, in a 1v4 or 1v5 situation nasus is going to die, but he can effectively duel 2-3 opponents at once if you've farmed up stacks properly. Nasus doesn't need to get fed off of \"bad players\" to deal damage, the player just needs to know HOW TO FARM STACKS PROPERLY. You literally could spend the entire laning phase just playing safe and farming stacks without ever touching your opponent, and you could still win the game easily if the game got to 30+ minutes.\n\nSo you're either incredibly uninformed about nasus or you're in really high elo where no one plays him. Because if you look at http://champion.gg/statistics/?league=platplus#?sortBy=general.winPercent&order=descend&roleSort=Top  Nasus is the 5th best top in plat, the 1st in gold, and the second in bronze/silver. \"Nasus isn't good, his laning and teamfight is bad\" idk what you're on about.","replies":[{"poster":"Iudex Gundyr","date":"2018-02-03T23:34:38.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":">Lol using my rank as an excuse to assume my game level knowledge, do you main top? Dear god I hope you don't. Look you can think whatever you want mate and that's fine, you're entitled to your own opinion. But I disagree,\n\nIt's common knowledge that silver players aren't good at the game mechanically, or in knowledge, so yeah. \n\nAlso, I've literally versed/played with the 2nd best Nasus in the world 4-5 times this season alone (Akali or GG) so I understand how the champion functions very well. \n\n>He can be zoned by many champs, but again he can sit under tower and heal back while stacking.

You can defend yourself against ganks if one of the two people running at you has a 90% slow and won't likely get to you by the time you're under tower. \n\nFreezing exists. You slow push wave 1, shove wave 2 and let wave 3 freeze and push towards you zone him. He is now 1-2 kills behind in gold, loses a level of exp and can't stack q if you play it properly. Especially the fact that you play against bad Nasus players should make this even easier. Also, Nasus is in a sense like Kog'Maw, a sitting duck in lane but scales into mid game super well. You just make sure they can't do anything. Nasus loses 2v2s and is easy to push out of lane. His lifesteal is aight but if he can't touch the minions or gets dove as soon as the wave comes in he really can't do much. \n\nAlso, his W is only 95% at level 13, not level 1. Up until level 8 is only slows for 35%-47%. CC or blunt damage will still kill him.\n\n>You're right, nasus in teamfights doesn't really provide any cc, but survivability???? Like I said his ultimate gives him MORE HEALTH, MORE DEFENCES and a lower cd on q to allow him to heal more from his attacks. Nasus has A LOT of survivability. \n\nHis healing is a non factor. Helps a bit in laning and side laning/split pushing, but not really anywhere else. You Q'ing the enemy top laner isn't going to heal you for much and if you ran it straight into the enemy backline you're probably dead. \n\nThe strongest champions in the game by role atm are champs such as\nTop: GP/Camille/Riven\nJG: Khazix/Shyvana/Nunu/Skarner\nMid: Katarina/Taliyah/Zoe\nADC: Kog'Maw/Tristana/Varus/Xayah\nSupport: Janna/Lulu\n\nImagine being a Nasus and running into a team comp like that. You get shit on in lane by all 3 top laners and good Nasus' would give up max 30-40 cs in lane to stop death. You also have Skarner/Nunu/Shyvana to contend with, they can all peel you off their teams REALLY well with slows and suppressions, also Shyvana can burst you pretty hard. Kha'Zix can mop up a team faster than you can. Same for Katarina and the lack of early MR Nasus builds. Taliyah and Zoe can kite and burst you easily. Kog'Maw, Varus can kill a Nasus VERY, VERY fast with their % max hp damage procs on their w's. Tristana and Xayah have ults and such for escape so you most likely won't be able to hold them down. Plus Janna/Lulu are the best peelers who actually happen to be the best supports right now with things such as polymorphs and knockups and slows and speed ups/shields for allies.\n\nNasus does not do anything versus that. He just dies. Also, whenever I vs Nasus, I just buy a QSS. If he W's you QSS and he dies before his W is back up unless he runs away.\n\n>You're also right about him only doing single-target damage, but nasus does not get kited easily lmao remember again he has a 90% SLOW, you use that on the adc and you've got them. If you build cdr its pretty much up by the time it ends so you have a perma slow, no ones kiting you anywhere.\n\nBuy QSS or Mikaels which are often built anyway and just cleanse it off you. Also, his W only hits one player. Not 3 or 4. 1, and thats if he gets in range. He's kitable and if he walks into a team with Nunu ulting or Skarner ulting him he actually dies before he presses R, let alone W.\n\n>Do you forget with enough stacks and tri force you can two shot people?? Have you literally never seen a GOOD nasus with a GOOD amount of stacks before EVER???\n\nHaha! Only the 2nd best in the world multiple times my friend, is that not good enough? And yes, I'm aware of the high damage Nasus can burst out, but the stacking process and how games usually flow item wise makes it really hard for Nasus to play around it. He's almost like a Jayce in the sense that if he doesn't get ahead/really farmed early he doesn't do as much as most other top laners and he scales quite poorly due to his lack of mobility and reliance on building a damage item/mvm speed item. A stacked Q doesn't matter if you die as soon as you walk into them. NO tank can survive a 4-5 item + adc pelting them in a fight. Not even Maokai. Even if you Righteous Glory flash W the adc you will be polymorphed, he will QSS (or be mikaels'd) and just kill you instantly because LDR/Mortal Reminder will cut through you along with their other items, and if you're versing a Guinsoos Vayne/Kog/Varus your day is even worse than that.\n\n>I have played with nasus enough to know that you only need a single triforce as your damage item then you can build full tank and with enough stacks you can both completely shred through people and soak up a ton of damage. Sure, in a 1v4 or 1v5 situation nasus is going to die, but he can effectively duel 2-3 opponents at once if you've farmed up stacks properly.\n\nYeah, mid-late he wins most 1v1's, even 2v1s. But that's his only strength. If the enemy adc/support come to match you late game you can't 2v1 them unless the ADC is underfed or doesn't have a QSS of any sort. Jax is OP because he wins almost all 1v1's late game and can split push well! Not really. Same case is for Nasus. As soon as Nasus pushes up he dies due to lack of mobility and if he groups and teamfights for his team he is relegated to bruiser and probably doesn't do very well.\n\n> Nasus doesn't need to get fed off of \"bad players\" to deal damage, the player just needs to know HOW TO FARM STACKS PROPERLY. You literally could spend the entire laning phase just playing safe and farming stacks without ever touching your opponent, and you could still win the game easily if the game got to 30+ minutes.\n\nIf the game went to 30+ minutes he would either win or lose immediately depending on the strength of the enemy tank busters (adc/mid). If they're weak, he probably does quite well, if they're on par or strong, his days are numbered.\n\n>So you're either incredibly uninformed about nasus or you're in really high elo where no one plays him. Because if you look at http://champion.gg/statistics/?league=platplus#?sortBy=general.winPercent&order=descend&roleSort=Top Nasus is the 5th best top in plat, the 1st in gold, and the second in bronze/silver. \"Nasus isn't good, his laning and teamfight is bad\" idk what you're on about.\n\nI use different, (arguably) better websites. That's why stats are different. Yeah, and I play in mid-high diamond. \n\nhttps://lolalytics.com/ranked/worldwide/diamond/plus/tierlist/\n\nYou'll find Nasus in tier 6, wayyyy at the bottom with an outrageously high 49.4% win ratio. \n\nI've played with a couple of high elo Nasus one tricks/players and it's a dreadful feeling knowing they will smash the early game and carry, or just do nothing the entire game and get blown up as soon as they're anywhere near the enemy team. I've played with them too much to not understand the way of Nasus.\n\nIf I change the tier from diamond + to silver Nasus becomes stronger and is tier 3. Why? Is it because champion op? No, it's because the champion is designed and plays in a way that punishes bad players. Such as Katarina, Shyvana and the like. When versing Nasus it's easy to play to his strengths if you are a bad player/team and that is when Nasus rolls over you. Add some common sense and good players to the mix and he drops all the way to the bottom of the barrel. You nerf Nasus you turn him into another Lucian. \n\nNasus is strong in silver because of the players, not the champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2018-02-04T00:21:38.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the difference in games also has an effect. For example in Bronze your much more likely to get a elongated laning phase. Which gives Nasus more time to stack safely without having to worry about being 5 man gibed. \n\nNow I am no where near the 2nd best Nasus in the world but I do enjoy playing him. In Bronze people are way to slow to pressure him. I very rarely see early ganks onto him or tower dives. Which tends to make it relatively easy to farm stacks. At the same time they don't give enough respect to his power spike when he gets his ult. But even in Bronze engaging with him after laning phase is difficult. Unless you have engage in your comp your literally just walking into the enemy team. If they have CC and peel and a competent adc things end real poorly for you. Which brings me to the other difference, in low teirs you often end up with little hard or point and click CC.

How can you possibly justify that? Especially seeming he is supposed to be a late game champ.\n\n\nAnd I'm with Fitzky on this one mate, his ult and spirit fire are AMAZING in team fights, not to mention that unless you want your team curb stomped into oblivion, you have to focus him in team fights... which means you get curb stomped into oblivion because if you're trying to get rid of him, you're not focusing the Vayne or Fizz or Kha etc.\n\nAs a champ in general, Nasus has too much going for him, and becomes way too unstoppable too early on in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Iudex Gundyr","date":"2018-02-03T12:36:01.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"In both examples (excluding Yorick) Nasus was fed/on his way and you were effectively trying to fight without any real backup to kill him with.

If he is not uber fed and righteous glory's into a team of 5, he dies in 2 seconds if the team he's running into isn't really bad at the game. Even if he's really fed, if your adc/mid are competent he dies regardless. \n\nWhen you versed him as Azir, he had roughly 50 magic resist. Boy was he tanky.

Which would be fine if his strengths suffered because of it, but they don't!\n\nYeah, he had no magic resist and there are better items to purchase for the intended purpose. Righteous Glory is not the best tank item. Tri-force gives good damage but close to no tank stats. Dead mans is good against AD, you had Azir and BC/LDR/Mortal Reminder are items in League of Legends that help counter it. Talisman, little-no tank stats. Nasus is squishy as hell for a top lane tank. He is literally a juggernaut. He's like Darius without the resets and true damage, and a weaker laning phase but scales better and is easier to play. That's why their win ratios are similar. \n\n>Azir's weakness is that he is squishy up close, so he could build full tank and get rid of that weakness. However he would lose most of his damage. This losing his main strength.\n\nHe is not that squishy with Liandries/Rylais/Zhonyas/Banshees existing, he also has e shield and ult for peel. Plus he can almost one shot you before you get melee to him due to his insanely high DPS for a mid laner thanks to his W especially if he is close to his team. His weaknesses aren't that apparent if you want to be biased about it.\n\n>Nasus doesn't lose any damage, nor any surviability, because he gets damage anyway with his stacks, and the vast majority of MS items he builds are tanky items. So either he shouldn't be able to build full MS or he should lose out on some of his strength if he does so.\n\nHe loses out on a hell of a lot of survivability. \n\nIf Nasus' final build is something along the lines of Triforce, Ninja Tabis, Righteous Glory, Deadmans Plate, Zz'Rot Portal and Spirit Visage. He gets roughly 1525 hp, 110 mr and 175 armor from items whilst having a decently fast (Triforce, RG, DP, Zz'Rot) movement speed build which doesn't really help in 5v5s that much but I'll go on.\n\nIf Nasus' final build is what a Maokai would build for example such as Sunfire Cape, Spirit Visage, Righteous Glory, Ninja Tabis, Thornmail and Adaptive helm. He gets roughly 1875 hp, 110 mr and 200 armor with losing a bit of damage and movement speed but is much beefier and also has things such as Thornmail and Adaptive helm passives to work with.\n\nSo in short, yes he definitely loses survivability and tankiness. Just because his R gives hp doesn't mean losing the tank stats from items is worth it.\n\n>Are you trying to say that there are champs that should be impossible to fight just because it's past 20 minutes? How can you possibly justify that? Especially seeming he is supposed to be a late game champ.\n\nHis mid game is stronger than his late game. Infinite scaling is a myth, you are not going to have 20 hour games where he gets ridiculous stacks. He thrives in fights where the enemy carries don't have the items to get through his Ninja tabis which is realistically first 25-30 mins of the game. Once carries buy damage he is a non factor and dies incredibly fast. His split push is good if left alone but he has no mobility to run with, he must turn and fight and he simply can't do anything 1v3+.\n\nAlso yeah, trying to fight a champion that is good at 1v1ing (most top laners) in it's prime is a really, really bad idea. Especially if they're fed, as in your cases. The same would be said for champs like Trundle and Illaoi and Camille and Akali and Fiora, and Jayce and Kled and Gangplank and Jax and Ornn and Irelia and Gnar and... you get the picture, right?\n\n>And I'm with Fitzky on this one mate, his ult and spirit fire are AMAZING in team fights, not to mention that unless you want your team curb stomped into oblivion, you have to focus him in team fights... which means you get curb stomped into oblivion because if you're trying to get rid of him, you're not focusing the Vayne or Fizz or Kha etc.\n\nHis ult allows him some hp which is decent in teamfights, and for him to spam his q's more if he's in range to cast them. Pretty nice but doesn't stop you getting blown up my enemy carries or cc'd for your entire life while you die to continuous ADC aa's. The E is pretty good if you use it correctly but it doesn't stop a bad teamfighter from teamfighting poorly. Also, you focus the tank anyway, so. Since he's less tanky than a regular tank, it is quite easy to verse him in teamfights. Yeah, he deals more damage than a Maokai, but you can just peel him before he gets in range or QSS, Mikaels, Cleanse the wither if he gets in range.  \n\nUnless you want your team to get curb stomped into oblivion you need to focus Darius in teamfights, Kled in teamfights, Trundle in teamfights, Gnar in teamfights, Tryndamere in teamfights, Irelia in teamfights. It's all the same.\n\n>As a champ in general, Nasus has too much going for him, and becomes way too unstoppable too early on in the game.\n\nIf he was a good champion he wouldn't hold a massive 49% win ratio in diamond +. Just because they're diamond doesn't mean they can beat him easily. He's too strong! Look at his strengths and lack of weaknesses that these high elo players somehow exploit! Nasus isn't strong. You played 3 bad games vs Nasus in low elo and you had a rantish type post on boards for some reason because you didn't look at his statistics and you didn't try to unbiasedly think about the weaknesses of the champion, you just ran to conclusions based on anecdotes.\n\nPeople playing into specific champions strengths because they're bad doesn't mean the champion is strong. It means that they're bad and versed a pub stomp champ that got fed. \n\nComplaining how Nasus is op is like complaining how Master Yi or Katarina, even Veigar are op. In low elo they are good pub stompers, outside of it, not so much.\n\nAs a side note. If you think 2-3 tank items makes a champ tanky. Even full tanks die fast if right clicked. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/3oucmN0epfU?t=4201","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-02T00:29:32.218+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah unfortunately, he can always get a sheen, and he can always get 20% CDR from his sheen item (Triforce didn't used to have 20%) when he used to struggle with CDR in the earlier game before Sheen also had CDR on it.\n\nYou can also QSS the slow on nasus, but yeah it's still too low a cooldown, especially for a champ that builds 40% CDR, but riot don't know how cooldown's work in general so you know.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-02-02T00:38:26.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yea they are giving so much power to early items like Sheen and Serrated Dirk, it really gives the wrong champs unneeded early power spikes. \n\nYea it can be QSSed, but unfortunately being majorly mages or tanks, QSS isn't on the menu for most of my champs :(\n\nYea, I lost full confidence in Riot's balance team when they made Kat's ult 15 seconds on PBE.

Given all that, Nasus is still very fast. The new runes even give him better lane sustain that before, so he can just tank all the harass he wants and just farm, and then regen it all back with Overheal and items, so playing to stop him from CSing is futile (unless you're Teemo, whom the Nasus would probably have banned).","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-02-02T00:13:27.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Obviously its not an actual snare... my point is that the slow is so severe there is often not much difference between the two.\n\nLike I said, i'm no maths wizard, call it whatever fancy name you want to. \n2 is still bigger than 0.\n\nYea, agreed, but even Teemo can only hurt him in early game, once it gets later on and Nasus has a spirit visage or adaptive helm, theres not much Teemo can do.\n\nNasus is actually a monster these days, and nothing seems to stop him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dis","date":"2018-02-06T11:55:28.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"OMEGALUL","replies":[]}]}
