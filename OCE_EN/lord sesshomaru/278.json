But...\n\nUhhh.. what do I do?\n\nI was Kalista. Master Yi entered from the side of the screen screen, as soon as i saw it, I pressed R, I died, then the animation for my ult finished, my support (Bard) threw himself to safety, he died. We were all full build.\n_(note the time in which the damage was dealt)_\n\nIts a simple question, how do I win?","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-04-16T03:37:18.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**TL; DR:** Ward, and communicate with support. If that's too hard just play Xayah and use ult when this happens XD\n\n__*\n\nThe thing with Yi is that he's relatively easy to counter, but you need two people to do it in almost every case. This is why he's usually kinda bad in high elo, and an absolute god in low elo.\n\nHere's a few things that I see as mistakes. Keep in mind I don't have a replay so I'm making a few assumptions, and A LOT of this is easier said than done.\n\n**Things that you can improve:**\n\n+ _\"Master Yi entered from the side of the screen\"_\n\n This was the first mistake. Assuming this was a mid - late game fight, then the side of the screen should have been warded, or wards should have been placed somewhere to catch Yi around 5 seconds before he got to the fight.\n\n Obviously this is largely Bard's mistake (like I said you need two people to counter Yi). But I'd be willing to bet that you had at least a ward or sentinel available before this fight and didn't use it.\n\n\n+  _\"As soon as i saw it, I pressed R\"_\n\n I believe Fate's Call has about 0.2 second cast animation, where you can't auto or move. This means hitting R was possibly the worst thing you could do as soon as you saw Yi, it literally gave him a brief root on you.\n\n Ideally, you see Yi coming in advance with a ward, re-position, and get Fate's Call ready. But in your case, I think an instant flash heal right after he Alpha Strikes would have been the safest option. Then it's up to Bard to figure out how to stun or disable Yi, **THEN** it's safe to cast ult and get to work.\n\n\n+ _You need a defensive item_\n\n  I'm not sure if you were full build when this happened, but if you were, there really needed to be a Guardian's Angel or health item in there. Even getting a defensive item before full build can be a good idea, but that gets complex and situational.\n\n**Things your support can improve** _(although it's also your job to remind them)_:\n\n+ _Caretaker's Shrine_\n\n  Bard needs to set up **at least one** Caretaker's Shrine behind you so you can use them after you flash. He should've also used an instant Caretaker's Shrine when Yi engaged. I'm assuming he did neither of these things since you died so quickly.\n\n\n+ _Bard's items..._\n\n I don't know if he was trolling, or you guys were just having a good time, but he really can't peal with Guinsoo's lol :) He needs {{item:3190}}, {{item:3107}} and possibly {{item:3109}}. If he's trolling then obviously it can't be helped, but otherwise let him know!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-16T23:37:29.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks man, this is great advice!\nIll take a lot of that on board!\n\nAs for the warding, we were inside the enemy base (Yi was dead, and we were retreating after an assault, as he respawned, and ran 10,000 miles an hour after us.)\nso warding wasn't really the issue here, but i see why it is essential to have wards down in other scenarios!\n\nYea i realise that using R was probably a mistake, but as the only hard CC Kalista has (and Yi cant be slowed by a quick Q-E) i felt it was the only thing i could do, as Kalista cant out damage him. \nBut you can still move while casting fate's call, (i don't know about attacking though, ive never taken note of that.)\n\nI was full build, and i should have built more defensively.\n\nIn all honesty, i cant remember much of what Bard did, I think that I robbed him of the chance of doing anything by drawing him in with my R. So thats another reason why R might have been a mistake.\n\nHe was building tri-force and other attack speed/damage items (it was normals and he was just having fun), so he definitely didnt have a peel build xD (infact I think he out damaged our Syndra)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-16T04:20:57.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^^^ Biggest mistake I see in lower elo (Gold and lower) when it comes to assassins (or anyone capable of assassination) is failing to understand ward lines. Especially important if you are behind or if you are a squishy, you need to set up ward lines and stay behind them. i.e if you have a ward in tri bush then you don't push past tri, you always stay a little behind that ward. Ideally you'd also have a ward in dragon pit and at red (for blue side) or in the river bush and at blue (for red side).\n\nEspecially versing champions like Yi or Zed or Talon that have high mobility, if you want to be in a lane you need at least three wards covering the paths to wherever you are. True ward lines need team coordination but your support has three wards, and for most adcs that is plenty of coverage to know when to leg it if they place them right. Vast majority of supports won't mind at all if you ask them to ward somewhere so long as you ask nicely.\n\nIf you haven't got wards, or your support has no charges, or you're on your own, then if there's a champ like Yi, just don't. Don't be where it isn't warded, don't be without your support or a CC capable teammate, if your support has no charges go b with them. You have everything to lose and the enemy has everything to gain by you risking it in these scenarios.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-04-16T07:33:53.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People providing all these ways in which he and bard could have outplayed yi but they forgetting that al of this happened in 0.65 seconds. Unless he's challenger that's pretty fucking ridiculous and stupid to react to, especially if it's low elo. I thought Yi and Tryndamere were rumoured to be getting changes/mini reworks? As I see it now unless you have a good amount of cc a fed yi will destroy a good 3-4 people in your team, especially if he's running cdr/full attack speed and he's using Q every 2 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-16T10:05:18.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Such is the design of a fed assassin-y champ. As much as I hate Yi and his bs and I feel he needs some kind of rework/retune, the advice is the same as with any other fed assassin, especially as a squishy, namely, ward up and don't be anywhere near him unless you have significant team support. Make him run in circles trying to find your squishy targets.\n\nI agree that at this stage it was too lat eto advise peel, especially with a bard support who's cc is pretty unreliable.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-04-16T09:48:32.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usually against hyper carrys like Yu I try to make sure I'm in the middle of my team as much as possible.

I don't care what anyone says, that's bs. He literally killed you in less than a second. 2500 dmg in less than a second. Wtf rito? How is your bard even suppose to peal you?\n\nI'm not sure what's up with Master Yi lately, but I've seen so many of them and they are so annoying. I don't know if they just buffed him or if it's the bork changes, but this guy needs some serious gutting. Unfortunately, that's probably not going to happen any time soon due to his new skin.\n\nHow to counter him? Well usually I'd tell you to ask your support kindly to go someone with lots of fast peel, like Thresh, Janna or Leona. However, if this is a normals game and you can't counter pick Yi, I suggest sticking very close to your support or not even coming into the team fight until he's dead. If he's really destroying you, it may be worth it selling one of your items and buying randuins. \n\nHope this helps, and I'm crossing my fingers that something is done about this guy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2017-04-16T01:09:13.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its really the same with any bull build champion that's either a burst mage or hyper carry, you need to have not been where you were and brand needed to stun yi instantly hes full crit meaning 700-8-00 damage per basic attack and at a max of 4 per second doing say 800 800 400 400\n\nits always situational when something like that happens but in your case you needed to flash away the instant alpha strike completes and not ult brand hope that brand stuns him and try to hit him even","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-04-16T01:07:10.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bard stuns yi after he alphas, bard soaks damage and dies for you to get enough spears in yi to kill him.","replies":[]}]}
