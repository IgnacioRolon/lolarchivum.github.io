Please let me humbly fall upon my sword for disgracing you so!\n\nIm sorry I was so selfish, I should have thrown myself into the enemy team and died with honour, allowing them shut-down gold, instead of maintaining my perfect game.\n\nI had 1 CS less than our ADC, please accept my humblest apologies, I know you can not abide your students being second best. I prioritised farming champions over minions. I have desecrated your teachings! \n\nI know excuses are meaningless at this point, but I swear I would have had more CS if Garen, Kai&#039;sa and myself hadn&#039;t had to permanently follow Tryndamere around wherever he went to 3v1 him to stop him shredding our team and objectives, and even then either Garen or Kai&#039;sa _(often both)_ had to give their lives before he could finally be slain, even in a 3v1. I failed to protect them, I don&#039;t even deserve to stand before you now..\n\nPlease show me what an S+ is supposed to be, so I can redeem my failings and bring honour to my family.\n\n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2018-03-14T08:23:30.861+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol i did way less to get an s+ on the old swain( from memory 6/0/10 with about 200 ish cs in a 30 minute game.)\n\nIts probably got to do with the re release being played more.bad luck i geuss","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2018-03-09T23:57:41.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You placed 1 Control Ward all game.\n\nYou only destroyed one ward all game.\n\nYou had 6.3 CS/min.

You certainly deserve an S+ with your performance. The things I stated are the over-the-top picky stuff that, knowing Riot, is probably what you need. I think it was the fact you only destroyed 1 ward and 2 towers, as well as your CS and objective damage.\n\nBut literally every other stat was brilliant. In fact, MY S+ games have worse stats. **The only stats that were considerably different was Vision Score** (I had a higher score even though the game was almost half the time), and the fact that I have **much better CS/min** even though I'm a Jungler. Not only that, but my high CS was due to counter-jungling, which put my direct opponent many levels behind.\n\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-03-10T04:11:06.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's no point placing another control ward when your first one still lives and provides vision in an important area, that's a waste of gold?\n\nOnce you're that far ahead, using your time and abilities to farm CS is a waste of your lead, when you can be using it to win fights and let other less fed champs have the CS.\n\nMy objective damage was low because I was the only one who stood a chance against Tryndamere (and even then I couldn't do it alone), so my job was pretty much to keep Trynd busy so my team could push and take objectives.\n\nI'm sorry I couldn't active phase rush more because we killed enemy champs too fast...\n\nIm not saying I'm good, I'm lucky I could pick up early kills and snowball,  but there is a lot of variables in league, and the game shouldn't rank you on such specific things. \"Sorry you didn't get first blood, no S+ for you! What's that? The enemy wasn't good enough to find and kill your control ward? No S+ for you!\"\n\nKDA isn't everything! I'll be the first to say that.\nBut when you get an anomalous score like that... that should just override the system.","replies":[{"poster":"Sulbatamol","date":"2018-03-10T21:15:10.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I dont know. Are you showing off yourself in forum ? Faker dosent get S plus in most of the game and we all know that you just have to be good enough and do right things for a particular one that you play. But as mid laners you couldve bought extra control wards and place in enemy jg and could give her jungler much worse time.

I don't think you understand.\n\nI had a control ward, that lasted for most of the game, I placed it in a spot where we critically needed vision, and for some reason they never found it _(or if they did, they didnt destroy it.)_\n\nWhy would I buy another control ward _(using up gold)_ to place in another spot, which would destroy the one I already had, causing us to lose vision in that important spot?\n\nIts common sense man..\n\nand It's not like we were lacking on vision _(You think I had no deaths by not knowing where the enemy team was?)_\nIn any case, their jungler was in our jungle most of the time in early game. Us having some trinkets in our own jungle early let us catch him out a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"Sulbatamol","date":"2018-03-11T10:34:03.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well you keep saying you placed a ward in important spot and i wonder how it never gets destroyed during a entire game???? Say if u placed a control ward in a small bush around dragon or baron pits which are important spots for both teams, how it is even possible that the ward just stays there forever. Also important spot in a game keep changes  depends what your teams focus is atm. Moreover, sometimes you place an extra control ward to make sure enemy team do not have a vision around a certain area when your lens is on cd. Placed a ward around an important spot and it never gets destroyed during a entire game???
