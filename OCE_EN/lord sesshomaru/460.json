And in reverse, if you build full tank, you should be very difficult to kill, but also have a hard time killing anything else too._\n\nThat seems to have fallen by the wayside with a number of champions.\nFor example: Kench, Mundo, Zac, Garen build either full tank, or almost full tank _(with like 1 damage item that also gives health like Black Cleaver or RoA)_.  So they are extremely hard to kill, and yet pump out ridiculous amounts of damage.\n\nIf any champion wants to deal damage, they should be forced to itemise for that.\nIf you build 1 damage item, you should do roughly a 6th of the damage a champ who builds 6 damage items does _(obviously within reason allowing for individual kits)_.\n\nCertainly theres nothing the average burst mage can do about a near 5000K HP Mundo or Kench bearing down on them.  Agreed no burst mage should be able to burst Mundo/Kench in any way that poses a threat to the tank, but equally, they shouldn't be frightened of Mundo/Kench pumping out stupid damage.\n\nConsidering the mobility and CC all of these champs have, I don't think they shouldn't have the damage they do, whilst also being a nearly un-killable tank.\n\nGive them a Thornmail, and theres not a lot many ADCs can do either _(which is ironic seeming sustained damage output is supposed to be the counter for tanks)_\n\nCan we please have a crackdown on these champs who do too much damage while having so few (if any) damage items?","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-08-19T01:15:39.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"mundo has 1cc, it's not even very good. It's a mediocre slow. Take away his damage and he doesn't do anything. Literally doesn't do anything except provide a mediocre slow.\nI think a fundemental misunderstanding you have here is the difference between 'Bruisers' and 'Tanks'.\n\nBruisers like Darius, Garen, Mundo, Olaf, Volibear, ect... are not tanks. \nThey can be tanky, but what fundementally differentiates them from true tanks is a lack of peel and engage abilities. They don't have the same ability to protect an adc, or start a teamfight or make a pick, and their lategame plans often revolve around splitpushing because of this. In a lategame teamfight, a maokai is far more useful than a darius, because maokai will survive longer, and whilst doing less damage, will be more disruptive with the vast amount of cc they can provide.\n\nA tank can easily lockdown an assassin trying to dive an adc or mage, making them easy to kill. A bruiser more or less has to try to kill the assassin after the adc dies, because they don't have ways to protect them. In alot of game scenarios, an assassin suiciding to eliminate 1 or more backline carries, is more than enough to win the game.\n\nA tank can initiate a teamfight well, using a variety of large CC engages and has survivability tools at their disposal that will prevent them from dying in short return. In exchange they don't do much damage, often relying on mediocre base damages or %hp damage or sunfire cape to create some pressure.\nA bruiser has to run at enemies, and hope they don't have the cc to peel them off and lock them down, or the kiting skills necessary to wear them down before they get into damage range. God forbid they have an ashe or a zilean, ever tried to play a darius or nasus in a lategame teamfight into a zilean? You're going to spend the next few minutes moving the slowest you've ever moved, and the only incidental damage you might deal may be a thornmail before you die.\n\nBruisers do have upside though. They're very snowbally, and are designed to take great advantage with gold and xp leads, through higher base damage, dueling mechanics and generally greater base stats. They trade off the CC and engage of tanks, in exchange for dueling power and damage, making them difficult to deal with in sidelanes splitpushing without a coordinated collapse.\n\nBruisers are designed to take a lead, run with it, and predetate on a team's lack of coordination and game knowledge, making them potent in low elos. Alot of players don't know how to play defensively, so it's easier for a Bruiser to get out of hand, for enemies to start feeding and have a considerable item lead, and use that to end the game before others can scale.\n\nBruisers primarily bring to teamfights, dueling potential and damage. They also tend to have tools to allow them to pressure a zone. Olaf for instance creates a zone due to the potential for his ult to mitigate attempts to peel him. In teamfighting scenarios, this creates a crux where a team can focus the olaf to quickly resolve him at the expense of cooldowns which would be disadvantageous in the ensuing teamfight, or concede the position, disengage through the use of mobility, again surendering cooldowns, and allowing the enemy team an advantage such as dragon control or a tower.\n\nA bruiser's kit relies on having the balance of tankiness and damage, that would allow them to create this zone of pressure and kill threat. It should be fairly obvious that a Xerath would not like to be in melee range with a Darius. Even if the darius has 1 damage and 5 tank items, and the Xerath has opted for 6 damage items.\n\n\nThere's nothing inherently wrong with bruisers, they fulfill a role in the game. They aren't just another form of tanks like you keep suggesting. Taking away their damage would make them less viable than they already currently are. They're a combination of tank and duelist, that are designed to be potent zoning tools.\n\n----------------------\n\nBasically, you need to learn and improve. Bruisers aren't the problem. They have counterplay, they're just unfortunately a role designed to capatilise off mistakes, much like assassins.\nThey're currently underwhelming at higher tiers of play, and nowhere near as oppressive as they were in season 2.\n\nIn the time honoured words of all gamers: Git Gud.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-08-20T14:53:19.950+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You have talked about almost everything except the 1 point I'm trying to make:\n\n_\"If you want a balance of survivability and damage, you should have to build a balance of damage and tank items.\"_\n\nE.g.

I'm saying that _if you don't build any damage items, you shouldn't be doing a lot of damage._\n\nIf you want to be a Bruiser, fine, but you should have to find the right balance between damage and survivability.  Not just build all tanky items and 1 half damage half health item and still cut swathes through the enemy.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-08-21T02:36:02.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Some champions are designed around base damage. Mundo doesn't have cc, he does damage in it's place, and his kit is designed to be a zone bruiser. Zone bruisers are designed to do enough damage to force players to disengage or focus them down. It wouldn't be very effective if they had to invest in damage to achieve this.\n\nIf we were talking about a Alistair doing crazy damage output with 1 damage item, I'd agree, but Mundo has been designed to 'exchange CC for damage'.\n\nAlso sunfire cape was designed to make tanks a relevant persistant damage threat for 1v1s or simply to augment base damage to give them ways to play against mages and adcs who misplay or misposition.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-08-21T08:24:02.794+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You can't just 'focus down' a Mundo.\n\n> Mundo has been designed to 'exchange CC for damage'.\n\nWhat about other fighters like Gangplank, Olaf, Rumble, Trundle, etc.  They sacrifice hard CC for damage too, but they don't get to be almost un-killable.\n\nOlaf is a perfect example of a 'bruiser' champ (using your definition),  he either frightens players away forcing them to disengage, or forcing them to focus him.  He's got fairly high damage, and is moderately tanky.  He builds a mix of damage and tanky items.  Thats how I think it should be.\n\nBy charging at you Olaf puts himself at risk too, his ult has a trade off, he does his job, but he has to play it right, or else he dies.\nMundo has no risk.  Theres not a lot you can do to him, you cant kill him (certainly not alone), if you CC him he can catch right back up again because of his permanent slow and movement speed (he's difficult to kite for the same reason).  You're stuck.\n\nAnd we aren't just talking about Mundo here, take Kench for example, he doesn't lack CC but still deals stupid damage for the number of tank items he builds.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-08-21T12:53:33.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Gangplank isn't a bruiser, he's somewhere between fighter, duelist and mage, and uses %armour shred on his barrels to decimate teamfights. Gangplank isn't tanky.\n\nRumble is an AoE damage mage, and whilst he is of a similar design to mundo, Rumble is closer to a mage/bruiser than a tank/bruiser.\n\nOlaf is very similar to mundo, and builds similarly, although Olaf has the option to go for more damage and lifesteal, and has complete CC immunity on his ult, whereas Mundo has tenacity and stacking magic resist. Full build Olaf tends to go for steraks and black cleaver as his damage items items, whereas full build mundo typically only goes titanic hydra. This is largely because mundo lacks scaling ratios and is more based around hybrid %hp damage. It's for this reason that Olaf tends to be better in sidelane split against duelists than Mundo.\n\nTrundle typically goes 1 damage item (generally triforce or Bork) into full tank as well, and into the right teamcomps, Ulting Trundle is so much harder to deal with than Mundo. Trundle is also slightly better at sidelane 1v1s.\n\n\nMundo's primary tankiness comes from healing and magic resist. Against ad duelists, %shred, and grievous wound items, Mundo can be countered fairly reliably, and whilst less susceptible to CC than some, Mundo is still peelable.\n\nTahm Kench is a tank bruiser, and thus doesn't need to build damage either. Kench is designed to be good at 1v1s, he's better at it than mundo and olaf, though worse than Trundle. Other than that, Kench is able to protect an adc but does a poor job engaging fights, and is far more kitable or peelable in teamfights than Olaf or Mundo.\n\nMundo also doesn't actually gain more damage with items, so bruisers who invest in a small amount of both magic resist and armour, will be better suited to fighting him, than squishies. If you want to focus down a Mundo, %hp shred and grevious wounds tends to make quick work out of the regenerating lump of hp.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-08-21T13:18:50.641+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah I know gangplank isn't tanky, that's the point I'm making.  \n\nAnyway, I think we have to agree to disagree.\n\nI don't like the 'unkillable juggernaut' playstyle.  I don't care if the stats are balanced or not, I think it's not fun for people to play against, and that defeats the whole purpose of the game.\n\nI think the game should be based around compromise and strategic building/playing.  \nIn my mind, having no hard CC is not an equivalent trade for being un-killable with the high damage he has.  He still has a big slow, and a very very high movement speed, so most champions cant escape him, or kill him before he can kill them.\n\nIm not saying mundo is 'brokenly op' or anything, i'm not even really talking about Mundo in particular.  But I don't think building full tank but still doing lots of damage (in any capacity), is a healthy thing for the game and people's enjoyment of it.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2019-08-21T15:05:21.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally after having played a few league games (and not playing more or less for a year), i'd prefer if we went to seasons past where it was possible to stand in a lane without just randomly being burst by 1 random ability.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-08-21T23:42:40.229+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I agree.\nThe damage and movement creep has just reached a point where any mistake at all means death.\nThere was a point somewhere in season 4 or 5 I think, where everything was _(relatively_) balanced, more so than now at least.\n\nI don't think that's just me being nostalgic either, I genuinely remember a spot where everything was pretty good.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-08-22T04:18:07.035+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I firmly agree with this.\nSeason 5 was the last time I regularly enjoyed LoL, which I just can't do anymore, and while a lot of that may be the botched Quinn rework that occurred at the end of that year, there's also been a lot of balance changes (and a *lot* of client-based changes) that have made the game much harder to enjoy (and particularly consistently).\n\nPersonally, my most hated change is Cho'Gath, and his stupid infinitely-scaling-true-damage-execute-1k+ ult.
