I have noticed this a lot and it needs to be brought to attention. Why hasn't this been addressed before? How the hell do Anivia mains put up with this? The indicator leads me to believe that it stuns everything in the circle, however I think that the circle you see in the screenshot may just be the first part of the ability (damaging things it passes through) but the explosion radius is separate and has no indicator. {{champion:34}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2015-07-18T04:36:54.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This happens almost 75% of the time, Since I've started playing her I've noticed it heaps and it is really annoying its cost deaths and not getting kills. \nRiot pleaseâ€¦.!","replies":[]}]}
