BNZ did not attempt to try and represent all of Oceania with their logo, but they happened to decide that Southern Cross would be the best for their purpose. It's like saying the Westpac logo represents all of Oceania as well.\n\nGovernments do take flags very seriously, New Zealand is currently in the process of changing it's flag. This is supposedly going to cost NZ $26 million, sited [here](http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/sites/all/files/publications/nzflag-process-cabinet-paper-october2014.pdf).

Also if they listened to the population, 62% of Kiwis don't want the flag changed in the first place. \nthey throw money pointlessly at it for no good reason, and to be perfectly honest all the flag designs they want us to chose from are complete shit anyway, so money well spent i guess....","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-10-02T10:38:56.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Using BNZ as an example is still biased, they don't even have a branch in Australia. How can the logo of a B-class bank, supposedly justify the use of the Southern Cross to represent OCE.\n\n> there isn't a single designer on the flag committee at all\n\nA flag for the people should be designed by the people. You said it yourself earlier, the problem with our first flag was that it was designed with political ties in mind.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-10-02T11:28:55.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im not saying that, I'm saying (badly it seems) that you wouldn't find a bank or other establishment in america or russia etc. that uses the southern cross, where you do find that down here. Likewise we wouldn't use an eagle in our bank logos, hence meaning that the southern cross must have some significance to our neck of the woods but not other regions.\n\nThere are many 'people' in NZ some of them happen to be designers and those people are more qualified to select final candidates for the flags, in the end the flag has to be designed by someone, it can either be a NZ citizen that is 8 years old or it can be a NZ citizen who has has 20 years of experience designing things. pretty simple choice to me. The sky tower was built for the people by the people, but they happened to be qualified people. Why should the flag be any different?\n\nAlso i never said that was a problem. I said that was the issue behind it, i like the flag just how it is, political ties were mostly what formed our nation and we shouldn't be so quick to forget that.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Æ’amous","date":"2015-10-02T09:28:55.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nobody said anything about the Southern Cross not representing Oceania.
