This means auto/basic attacks don't track, and makes the whole thing WAYYY more complex). In LoL, basic attacks (and point and click abilities) are processed to hit (and damage) on launch, not when they actually strike you.\nI've had {{champion:90}} ults on people that {{champion:412}}  lanterned so far away, but the suppresion beam follows with them (like a whole screen diagonally).\n\n[edit] Sorry for referencing PoE so much, but I beta tested the fuck out of that game (and had entire patches implemented on my feedback alone, I even had email chains with the top dog (founder/creator/developer) going. Most people only got staff member feedback, but not me).","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-14T08:35:40.471+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that one I'm not sure about. As far as I know anything affecting the attacker (like a blind) is calculated at launch (so an auto attack launched before being blinded but hitting after would still hit) but anything affecting the defender (like invulnerability) is calculated at contact (so being un-Zhonya's at launch but Zhonya's at impact would result in no damage).\n\nAt least that's what I think you're talking about here.\n\nAs far as I know Kindred's ult (assuming you meet the health requirements) would fall under the second scenario, but from the screenshots it looks like he wasn't actually in it yet. \n\nZoe's health bar doesn't match up with her target-able model in her ult but I'm pretty sure that's intentional. Her bar shifts as soon as she is untargetable going in, not when she becomes targetable coming out. You can see in the first screenshot, her healthbar has shifted but her model is still just barely in the portal.\n\nThe alternatives are:\n1. Do the opposite, at which point we'd be clueless as to the moment Zoe actually becomes untargetable \n2. Remove her bar entirely while she is untargetable, at which point it's very easy to lose track of where she is if there's any other effects going on, the screenshots being a very good example of this\n3. Have the bar move with her like a Trist W, which would be very hard to track nevermind read, and also misleading because she isn't targetable in that time like Trist is, nor is she a moving target (the target itself is entirely stationary in this time first at point A, then at point B, then back at point A)\n\nWithout knowing exactly where that 565 damage came from and whether it was before or after the Zoe ult I can't be sure, but to me it looks like he died just under the ult.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-05-14T12:36:51.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a very in-depth analysis guys :)\nI wish there was an easy way to share the replays, so others can watch and go over it frame by frame.\n\nThere was a lot going on at the time so I'm not 100% sure, but I think there was an auto in flight when I ulted, however because I still have HP when my health bar appears inside the ult, either the auto hit me before I entered and didn't do enough to kill me, OR it hit after I entered, and thats where the 546 damage comes from. Either way, in theory I shouldn't have died from it.\n\nOn a side note, I have noticed that when Zoe dies at point B in her ult, her dead body still teleports back to point A. Perhaps that has something to do with it _(the way it is coded as being a 'temporary' position or something)_. I dunno.\n\nInteresting through.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2018-05-14T08:01:34.507+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is probably a stupid answer from a stupid player, \nbut maybe portal jumping doesnt work?","replies":[]}]}
