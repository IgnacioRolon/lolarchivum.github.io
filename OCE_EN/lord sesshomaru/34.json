IMO Leblanc atm is just a better version of Zed lol.\n\nIf players want to ban a champion that isnt OP that doesnt mean Riot should just nerf it -_- I think they take much more into account than Ban rate when thinking about the strength of a champion. \n\nremember player perception plays a huge role in what gets picked and banned as well. Not just how strong a champion is. Thats why Lee is always top in pick rate for jungle but has a sub 50% win rate.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dQwEuPI.png","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-05-13T23:26:34.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Player perception is just as strong of a factor for nerfs as any other, it means that 73% of teams miss out on a otherwise tactical ban, because they feel forced to ban Zed, that isn't healthy for the game. \n\nSure lee isn't the most powerful of champs, but he sure as hell is one of the most annoying, just like Zed.\n\n And if like in Zed's case, the majority of people DO NOT want him in their games, then regardless of wether he is OP or not, he should be changed in some way to make him less hated. \n\npretend that RIOT is the Coca-Cola company, and they release a new drink, if 11% of the population LOVE it, but 73% hate it and will ban it from being in the shops in their area, Coke will withdraw the drink and change it wont they. So why should riot be any different? Why disadvantage 73% of players to make the 11% that play Zed happy? (and tbh I'm sure that Zed mains will want Zed nerfed (or changed) too because then they can actually play their favourite champ in ranked again)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lonely Rat","date":"2016-05-12T23:47:50.325+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"I seriously Disagree with this, Zed is in a good place at the moment. He doesnt need any changes as he is an ideal assassin. He has many pros especially with the most recent change to Quicksilver Sash. BUT dont be fooled he click to kill champion. He does have a skill cap and with the most recent change to zhonyas  he isnt as deadly early game as he used to be. There are alternative ways to deal with zed too. Lulu is awfully good mid and can deal plenty of damage in team fights whilst still providing plenty of utility. \n\nTL;DR look at what zed is strong against and be aware of the chance he can be picked in champ select and have a plan ready to beat him. Exhaust helps plenty!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-05-13T23:17:43.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zed or FF,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=hIyaAy1f,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-05-12T23:47:50.325+0000)\n>\n> Zed is in a good place at the moment. \n\nHe is banned 73% of the time..

Riot is pushing playing as a team to survive and win, especially with these nerfs and now that Dynamic Q is the only option.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2016-05-13T10:10:11.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Zed or FF\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-05-14T23:14:01.918+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think {{champion:238}} is in a decent spot.

But with Zed and Ekko, wheres the risk??\nFor LB and Fizz, at least they have the choice to either use their escape to leave the fight when things go south, but doing so cuts a HUGE chunk of their damage out. Zed doesn't sacrifice any damage for an easy escape.","replies":[]}]}]}
