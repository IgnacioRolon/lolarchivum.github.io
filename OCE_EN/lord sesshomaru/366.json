That the black mist didn&#039;t actually happen on Twisted Fate&#039;s page, and Kalista was never hunting Twisted Fate.\r\n\r\nB. Kalista was mistaken and sent the black mist to an innocent person, and has now realised her mistake and no longer hunts Twisted Fate.\r\n\r\nC. Once targeted by the mist even if you&#039;re innocent like Twisted Fate, Kalista can not call off the hunt.\r\n\r\nD. Does not sacrificing your own life after you have already tried everything else to save your friend, still count as betrayal in the eyes of Kalista and she still hunts Twisted Fate.\r\n\r\nE. Insert own answer.\r\n\r\nTwisted Fate is one of my favourite champs and i really love reading all the lore about them and their interactions, Azir is my Main champ and he is has a whole library of lore surrounding him, and I&#039;m so glad that Twisted Fate does now as well, but just like how the Arival of Azir re-wrote a lot of lore, i was wondering if this was the same with Kalista&#039;s interaton with Twisted Fate.","replies":[{"poster":"Jaredan","date":"2015-07-30T23:16:52.286+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Though Twisted Fate didn't see it as a betrayal, Graves certainly did at the time, and, frankly, for good reason. Though TF might have seen it as the only way out, Graves trusted their ability to get out of virtually any situation, if they stuck together.\n\nTo Graves, at that moment, the person he trusted the most to back him in any situation absolutely betrayed that trust.\n\nThey're just two different people whose flaws tore them apart because they didn't really understand each other. By the end of Burning Tides: The Reckoning, that isn't the case. Well, not as much anyway.\n\nAnd hello!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-07-31T00:41:11.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks for replying! :)\nah ok that makes sense!\nSo with Kalista's vengeance it doesn't matter if they actually betrayed the other person or not, its just if the other person thinks they have?\nso if someone pretended to be me and played a trick on one of my friends, my friend would think it was me and Kalista would have valid reason to hunt me down? \n\nbut if it does work on the basis of what they betrayee 'feels' or 'thinks' happened, not what actually happened, how does Kalista know that someone thinks/feels that? does that mean that graves actually actively called upon lady vengeance? so does that mean that Sivir, Azir and Shen all called upon lady vengeance too, so do the souls of 4 champs actually belong to Kalista now?\n\nand now that graves knows the truth that TF did all he could (short of dying) and that they are on better terms now can he reverse the deal and call off the hunt, or is the soul bond a fixed thing and both Graves and TF are doomed now regardless because of those actions?\n\nAlso Graves doesn't seem the type to call for help from a spirit, it even showed in burning tides that he was afraid that TF would be killed by his leap off the bridge or by GP's minions, he didnt want to be robbed of the kill, which is what Kalista would do.\n\nAlso on that note, Azir is far too proud to call for help, and Shen believes Zed can be redeemed so its odd to send a spectre of revenge after him to kill him. so it seems contradictory to their personalities to call forth Kalista.\n\nsorry for all the questions, I'm just trying to understand how it all fits together.","replies":[{"poster":"Jaredan","date":"2015-07-31T03:42:08.860+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kalista operates very specifically on an intentional bond forged by the individual who has been betrayed. However, I think Kalista, as the Spear of Vengeance, knows the underlying truth of whether there is a deserved response when she is called (usually it is, because someone is willing to spend their last breath to invoke her).\n\nMalcolm would never have called upon her to exact his vengeance upon TF. He wanted to do that himself, partly out of pure rage and partly because he needed to understand why his friend did what he did.\n\nAlso, I wouldn't take the tease for Kalista too literally, though it does bring up a lot of interesting possibilities about relationships between various Champs and there are certainly elements of betrayal in those who were highlighted.\n\nNo reason to apologize for the questions, it's great to discuss these things.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-07-31T08:45:48.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh ok I see, thanks so much for taking the time to explain :)\nAnd I also agree totally with what DiamondAries is saying, it's amazing all the effort that goes into making these lore events, I'm still hyped about the Azir/shurima one and this bilgewater one rivals even that!

Burning Tides: The Reckoning was written by a team that included a senior writer whose red name I can't bloody remember, Ant in Oz (yup, an Australian), John O'Dyin, and myself (a whingeing pom!), with editing provided by JohnnyRedactor and FamilyJules, and production support from another Rioter whose red name escapes me (I'll follow up with them). The original story breaking session and outline included a few additional folks, including WaaaarghBobo (principal writer on Tahm Kench and Rek'Sai) and a couple of other talented Rioters. So, as you can see, the story alone was quite the team effort. Then add on the amazing art, the game designers, visual designers, production and so on, and it's obvious just how big an undertaking the event was.\n\nIt's an inspiration to work with so many talented people, I tell you.\n\n> the people behind the scenes that do all this work that we take for granted definitely deserve more credit from is than they get,\n> But id love to know if the person who wrote it has written any novels, because I'd love to read them,\n> Perhaps they could write one for LoL itself, like the assassins creed franchise did, and it could tell the detailed story's or side story's of some of the champs.\n\nWe're not big on taking credit, that comes from just bringing value to the players. The writers who worked on The Reckoning come from a variety of backgrounds (novelists, television writers, a journalist, video game writers, table top game writers etc.)\n\nThere are a variety of ways we want to bring more story to players. I'll just leave it at that.\n\nThanks again for the kind words.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-08-01T03:05:18.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much for bringing everything together and creating this for us! we do really appreciate it!  its inspiring\nand pass our thanks on to the rest of your team as well :) \nist amazing that so many people with such varied backgrounds have the opportunity to work together on a project like this. id love to get into game design, not the programming, but the design of lore and characters. hopefully one day maybe even at RIOT haha but I'm pretty sure thats the dream of everyone else here too haha \n\nand i hope to see what comes next, It'd be cool to see ionia and have the rift all in cherry blossoms etc and see how yasuo's tale plays out, but whatever it is i cant wait!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-07-31T13:24:23.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jaredan,realm=NA,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=tAppZNfE,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2015-07-31T03:42:08.860+0000)\n>\n> Kalista operates very specifically on an intentional bond forged by the individual who has been betrayed.
