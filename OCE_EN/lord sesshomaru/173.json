My computer and internet connection are almost always fine but every couple of months I will get bugsplat and randomly dc from a game. I always reconnect and I know that other people have the same issue. Occasionally, other things happen to people as well, like computers overheating or a random drop in otherwise perfectly good internet connection. While these situations are frustrating to other members in the game, they are usually a one off occurrence. \n\nIf things like having a toaster computer or unreliable internet connection cause multiple dc's per game or over a period of a couple of hours, then sure. The leaver buster system will help motivate people to sort these issues out but there should be a little leniency for one off dc (especially if you have proof of trying to reconnect or having reconnected in a short amount of time).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-12-21T05:13:20.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Often you see people who love to DC within the first five minutes of a match then come back after the twenty minute mark. The reason they do this is they want to know why the game hasn't finished yet, they want to get onto the next game they can ruin.\nWhen they do come back these people will typically throw insults and what not trying to ruin the team's cool so that they will lose faster.\n\n\nI see a lot of QQ in this thread by people going \"Oh but such and such happens and you can't stop it\" actually you can.\nIf you know there is a problem, or will be a problem then don't play. DON'T PLAY!\nYou either fix the problem, or wait for the problem to go away. Then you can play.\n\nThe individual has full control on if they get banned or not.\nOver the past year I've had about seven events where I have dropped from a game, each one of those were actually beyond my control, but they were sporadic enough during the rein of the the old Leaver Buster that I didn't even get a warning.\nNow I'm not the best LoL player, hell I'm not even the least %%%%ing toxic, but I refuse to be the reason my team loses. Even though I'm a jungle main and it's always the jungler's fault.\n\nEveryday I want to play LoL or any other game that locks you in with match making I go through a check list:\n-Are any telecommunications companies doing work in the area\n-Is there a thunderstorm or any other potential cause of a black out\n-Is my internet paid for\n-Are any of my computer systems screwing up\n-Do I have any prior commitments\n\nIf any of these will interfere with my playing LoL I wont play. End of story. That is it.\n\n\nFreak occurrences are very rare, and in the majority of cases if it is a computer error you will have prior warning to it occurring in some form. If it's a blackout, usually you have warning for that too, like I don't know the MASSIVE %%%%ING BLACK CLOUDS OVER HEAD!\nOne's computer overheating I would never take as a valid excuse, because that is user neglect.\n\n\n\nOverall I am seeing results from the New Leaver Buster, positive results. From Bronze to Diamond I see a lot less AFKers and DCers, and people like you want this system changed so it no longer gets results. What kind of logic is that?\n\nIf you don't want to be hit by the Leaver Buster it's simple, make sure you don't. Don't play under circumstances that would cause you to leave. END OF STORY.\nThere is no counterargument.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2014-12-21T07:16:11.031+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Firstly, i never said i wanted the system changed i asked WHY it does what it does, nowhere did i ask for it to be changed,\n\nSecondly i have never left a game since halfway through the year when there as a power cut because someone hit a pole with their car and died (not exactly predictable) and then the other day for some reason out of my control i was stuck in champ select in an ARAM game for 7 minutes i don't know why because the internet was fine and the computer is high end, i think it was a glitch in the Lol server but i dunno, after the 7 minutes i managed to re-connect to the game, and play for 12 min we did lose most probably because of my absence, yet both teams welcomed me back with no hate, and i got a leaver buster warning, so obviously the old leaver buster and new are very different.\n\nThirdly \n\"Everyday I want to play LoL or any other game that locks you in with match making I go through a check list:\n-Are any telecommunications companies doing work in the area\n-Is there a thunderstorm or any other potential cause of a black out\n-Is my internet paid for\n-Are any of my computer systems screwing up\n-Do I have any prior commitments\"\n   Are you serious? its a computer game, not a life support machine, sure in ranked you take extra precautions not to have dinner or make sure no one is streaming or whatever, but put it in perspective, it is just a computer game, (admittedly one i take very seriously) but I'm not going to stop playing a normal game because of a few black clouds outside that is the best time to be on the computer cos you cant go outside.\n\nLastly \nmost people who DC (unless there is rage) DC for reasons out of their control, sure they could take all your precautions, but should be punished if they don't, after all putting it in perspective, the worst thing that can happen is that you slightly annoy 4 members of the community on a fantasy computer game, is that worth banning someones account that they have spent real money on skins and stuff on?","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-12-21T07:21:43.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"> Lastly \n> most people who DC (unless there is rage) DC for reasons out of their control, sure they could take all your precautions, but should be punished if they don't, after all putting it in perspective, the worst thing that can happen is that you slightly annoy 4 members of the community on a fantasy computer game, is that worth banning someones account that they have spent real money on skins and stuff on?\n\n\nThat is an outright load of horse%%%%.
