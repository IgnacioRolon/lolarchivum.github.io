Wolf is a wolf's head and lamb is a humanoid lamb, neither are human but neither are fully animalistic either, I'm not sure what your point about lamb is, she is humanoid because people relate better to humanoid characters than non humanoid ones, but there is clearly enough 'lamb' features for someone who knows nothing about her to realise that she is either a lamb/sheep or a goat. if you just had a little lamb running around on all 4 legs Baaaaaaaaa-ing at people it wouldn't quite be the same.\nno non humanoid champion has a popularity of over 10% (they don't even make it close to that even) because people relate better to people characters, even kha'zix is humanoid. The only Dog feature that nasus has is his face, but thats enough for you to make the animal connection.\n\nI did grow up with it and i understand how it works, and thats why i made this post in the first place, because their wording is contradictory (I'm talking about wording here remember, not meaning) \n\nand thank god that all champs are not like diana, that would be boring as fuck, but theres a line between interesting and contradictory.\nLook at Jhin for example, his lines are badass but most of them mean absolutely nothing at all, not saying thats a bad thing but they are cool without being contradictory.\n\nI agree that the way Aurelion sol speaks is awesome, Neil Kaplan was the perfect choice, any other actor wouldn't have brought it to life as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-03-15T08:47:15.328+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The wording is meant to be contradictory and distracting.

They are death itself, and everyone views death differently (also hence the quote \"I wonder how they see me\" and Wolf replies \"Ashes on wool\" as how he sees Lamb).

Kindred as an actual entity is very ambiguous. \n\n> if their form doesn't always have a bow and arrow and wolfilke teeth?\n\nI feel the references are very metaphorical here. Lamb's bow is a metaphor for a peaceful death, and Wolf's teeth for a not so peaceful one. You could supply whatever appropriate metaphor you wished.\n\n> also Magga sees kindred how they are in the game as well\n\nThe particular legend seen in the teaser depicts them as a Lamb and a Wolf, Magga likely sees them this way because this is what she expects death to be from the legends that she knows, just as someone who knows death as the grim reaper might expect to see something more like Thresh or Karthus waiting for them. Just because everyone CAN see death differently, doesn't mean they will, and our perceptions are coloured by the things we learn, there is no such thing as an unbiased perspective (you can be objective, but you perception will still always be different because of your experiences).\n\n> which means wolf and Magga see lamb in the same way\n\nAshes on wool is pretty loose. It implies a lamb/sheep certainly, but isn't definite. It could be that he sees her not as a Lamb, but rather as the actual ashes and 'on wool' is simply poetic, the aftermath of destruction that enables new life. It was hinted that Kindred has no 'true form' but given the ambiguity you could probably consider Lamb and Wolf Kindred's true form if you wanted. \n\nBut we also don't know how much the dying person sees of them. When Kindred speak, does the person hear them, or do they talk only to themselves unless they wish otherwise? Perhaps someone who survived an encounter with Kindred like Magga did heard Wolf say that, and the legend formed around their story, creating the legend of Lamb and Wolf as we know it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-03-15T09:56:45.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> \"Stars are not born, they are made, by me.\"\n\"I grieve for every star never born.\"\n\nStars are born & made by Aurelion Sol ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )\n\nEDIT:\n\n> \"There are no dragons like me.\"\n\"Celestial dragons live and die by our own rules.\"\nSo.. are there more celestial dragons? or is he the only one? again... pick one..\n\n probably means that \n\n1) There are no more celestial dragons\n2) There are no celestial dragons other than Aurelion Sol on Summoner's Rift.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-03-15T05:43:48.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1 for attention to details.\n#ritopls","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-03-14T08:05:04.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definition of our:\n>2. used in formal contexts by a royal person or a writer or editor to refer to something belonging to or associated with himself or herself.\n\nBecause they are his rules (and he sees himself as a god) then the use of our in that context is fine.\n\nFor the first one, born and made can be used basically as synonyms but yeah it sounds a bit sussed, as the first one seems to be used to talk down while the other should be using his own words.\n\nAs for Kindred, remember that the version we are seeing of wolf is as they are in the League (for lack of a better way to describe it, like really Rito?) more or less if wolf is released to kill someone it is very possible that he then has claws, the claws part could also be referring to lambs hands (as we all know wolf has some trouble with words, he may be using lambs hands as his claws without knowledge otherwise.) or it could even be used to refer to their job, in that they can't run.\n\nThese can all be interpreted as wrong, but because we don't know the actual interpretation (the one Rito holds) it's hard to know if these are mistakes or purposeful.","replies":[]}]}
