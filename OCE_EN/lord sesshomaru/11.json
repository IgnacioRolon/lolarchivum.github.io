I&#039;m a mid lane main, so I don&#039;t often have to lane against him, but because no one on my team ever picks tanks, I find myself having to go top much more often to make sure we don&#039;t have 5 assassins....\r\n\r\nAnyway, whenever I lane against him no matter how much I poke him he still seems to get fully farmed up. \r\n\r\nmy main top laner is Shen, but as Shen I can never seem to stop him farming, whenever I try to harass him, he doesn&#039;t pay me any notice, takes his minions, I end up being the one that misses out, then he life-steals and before you know it, he is full hp again AND has the minions.\r\n\r\nFiora is another of my favourite top laner&#039;s but even when I dash in for a Q+2nd E harass, on a vital spot. He will continue farming, and have his hp back again.\r\n\r\nso what should I do?","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-08-08T04:56:28.450+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should always look to freezing the lane at your tower. This means nasus has to come to your tower to farm making him vulnerable to ganks. Pick lane bullies into nasus, like Pantheon, Graves, Garen, Darius and punish for every attempt at farming. My third and final tip for dealing with a fed nasus toplane do not send 2 people, send 3 to deal with him. ","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-08T06:49:38.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"literally any lane bully will do, and try to freeze lane and force nasus to lose a chunk of hp for every stack he tries to get by trading hard when he goes for cs. Nasus doesn't have much base damage without stacks and so you can generally out trade him if you can keep him zoned since he relies alot on stacking and his passive lifesteal. Shen is going to have a bad time against nasus though; but champions like Pantheon, Renekton, Garen, Irelia, Darius, Riven, Fiora and Teemo (for nasus this matchup is absolute torture) and also melee champions that use massive lifesteal like xinzhao, jax, warwick, ect... since  nasus can't outrade them early. If you have a fed nasus problem, the best solution to send up there to stop him is usually the support or midlaner but the jungler will usually suffice if he hasn't gotten too stacked or fed. Zilean, Teemo, Morgana, Vayne and most ranged midlaners can generally stop a fed nasus without much effort.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-08-08T07:29:41.571+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"play illaoi or yorick and build a zz rot","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-08T23:39:17.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes totally a good idea. Also buy alot of pinks and pop them in the middle of the lane to distract him from cs.

This way the minions will push towards your tower, but you will be harassing him, and he can't really fight back. He is essentially risking HP for stacks. If you play it right you'll freeze. \n\nIf you are a ranged top laner (I count GP as ranged btw), this becomes even easier because you have consistent pressure. With Fiora or Shen you'll have to dash in to poke, but with GP or Lissandra you make him be conformed into \"playing safe\". It's not very safe for him though as he will push towards your tower, making him miss cs and be open to ganks.\n\nAs Shen I would say wait for him to go in for a melee minion, then E-Q-W him so you block the damage but can land some sweet poke.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-08T23:41:31.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't fiora use her w reposte thingie to zone him of the cs though?
