It is larger than the others, to make viewing quick and easy.\r\nAt a brief glance, it shows you 4 things:\r\n\r\n1. What champions dealt damage to you. _(champions not involved in your death are greyed out,)_\r\n\r\n2. Your killer. _(The champion that dealt the final blow is centred and is larger than the rest, in this case, Kassadin.)_\r\n\r\n3. How much % of the damage taken, came from each champion. (Kassadin dealt 73% of the damage, while Soraka only did 27%)\r\n\r\n4. The main type of damage from each champion. _(both Kassadin and Soraka dealt primarily magic damage, as indicated by purple text. A physical damage champion would have a red number, and Vayne might possibly have a white one in some situations.)_\r\n\r\nUnlike the live death recap, it shows every champion that damaged you, not just the top 3. Increasing clarity after team fights.\r\nFor many people, thats all they want to know, and they need look at it no further.\r\nBut for those wanting to know more, you can select different champions in section 1 in order to change section 2.\r\n\r\n__________\r\n\r\n**Section 2:**\r\n\r\n__________\r\n\r\nSection 2 shows the breakdown of all the damage sources of a single champion that affected your death.\r\nWe can learn 3 things:\r\n\r\n1. Exactly what damage sources (or cc) you were hit with, per champion.\r\n\r\n2. Which sources did the most damage.\r\n\r\n3. What type of damage each source did.\r\n\r\nIn this case we can see that Kassadin used his QWER, proc&#039;d thunderlords, used ignite, and auto attacked us with red buff, activating sheen. We can see that most of his power comes from magic damage, but there was still roughly 250 non-magic damage.\r\nIf you clicked on Soraka, the golden border would switch to her, and Kassadin&#039;s damage sources would be replaced with hers.\r\n\r\nThis horizontal way of showing it, as well as showing only 1 champ at a time, means that you can go to a far greater level of detail than just the top 3 spells it is currently,_(or sometimes the bottom 3, depending on the death recap&#039;s glitchy mood)_\r\n\r\nThe damage sources are listed from highest to lowest damage, for ease of reading. _(so if you want, you can just glance at the first few, to see the majority of where the damage came from)_\r\n\r\n___________\r\n\r\n**Section 3:**\r\n\r\n___________\r\n\r\nSection 3 gives you the damage that comes from non-champion sources, such as: \r\nMinions, towers, jungle monsters, and epic monsters.\r\n\r\nEach source has its own symbol, that symbol becomes lighter when that entity assisted in your death, but is otherwise greyed out, and the damage dealt by each entity is shown below. _(in this situation we can see that we took minion and tower aggro, but no damage from baron/dragon/herald/jungle-creeps)_ This means that minion aggro doesn&#039;t take up an &#039;assist&#039; slot, like in the live recap, and will be registered even if you have more than 3 champs attacking you.\r\n\r\nSection 3 also shows a new piece of information: **What actually killed you!**\r\nThis is something that is missing from the live death recap. \r\nWe have all come out of a fight by the skin of our teeth, just to die randomly outside the fight, and have no idea what caused our death.\r\nWith this design, it doesn&#039;t matter how much or little damage it did, the recap will show you what effect brought you from 1 HP to 0 HP _(wether it was Death-fire-touch, or Demacian Justice)_, in the form of a large icon in the middle of the page. _(In this case, we can see that Kassadin&#039;s ignite did the final damage.)_ But if minion aggro killed us, it would show an icon of a minion instead.\r\n\r\nAlso at the bottom of the recap, it gives us the same &quot;X damage within X time&quot; statistic which is always useful.\r\n\r\n___________\r\n\r\nWhen the recap is closed, it is dulled in colour _(so you don&#039;t have a giant shiny golden bar in front of your face while trying to watch a fight)_, but still shows you the damage taken, and the time it took, for ease of reference.\r\n\r\nI have done away with some information that is on the live recap.\r\n\r\n1. The summoner name is gone. This doesn&#039;t really help tell you how you died _(and no one really cares)_, and you can always check in in the TAB menu anyway, so I figured it just took up space and wasn&#039;t essential to the recap.\r\n\r\n2. The champion&#039;s items are gone, again, you can check this in TAB, and doesn&#039;t directly tell you how you died, so I thought it unnecessary as well.\r\n\r\n3. Words. _(Damage, Riftwalk, KIller, magic, physical, ignite)_ are all words that are in the live recap, but are kind of unessecary. Once you know the logic _(purple is magic, red is physical)_, you don&#039;t really need words, and they just become clutter. Most league players instantly know the visuals anyway.\r\n_(it is a possibility that words could pop up when you hover over the icon, if people still want words?)_\r\n\r\nI cant really be the judge of wether this is better or worse than the current one _(because I&#039;m bias towards my own work)_.\r\nBut I personally would be satisfied with this level of information in the death recap.\r\n\r\n____________\r\n\r\nI want to stress that, a random player, did this design in a day.. a few hours even. _(it&#039;s far from perfect, but i think it&#039;s more helpful than the current system.)_ So Imagine what an entire team of professionals in a multi billion dollar company could do over a couple of months!\r\n\r\nSo yea, I thought id put it out there. Let me know if you like it, or if you don&#039;t.\r\nHopefully someone at Riot can pass it on to whoever might be looking at the death recap, maybe it&#039;ll provide an Idea, maybe not. \r\n\r\n______\r\n\r\n**TL;DR:** I designed a new Death recap in the hope something in it might help Riot with developing a new one:\r\nhttp://imgur.com/a/NnMdC","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-05-22T09:36:08.119+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow!
