(like a nocturne&#039;s ult radius distance away) and when you aren&#039;t close to each other just have a little icon on the buff/debuff board thing. have the sword pop up when you become the villain but go away unless you are near garen.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-12T05:29:03.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wtf how its not huge don't zoom in or make your overlay smaller wow","replies":[]}]}
