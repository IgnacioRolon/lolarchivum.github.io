I&#039;m not sure which is worse.\nYou guys actually mentioned the aggro thing in a post once _(god knows which one, ill have to try and find it now)_. \n\n**EDIT:** I will continue to search for the aforementioned Riot post, but even if you just google 'Azir Soldier's minion aggro' you can clearly see it has been around forever.\n\nNext, we get these two:\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/090c5fd33e49196e15d8bb33cd1987a3.png\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/cecd235eeee9e5d56a3b6d32da792884.png\n\nI just love the quote: _&quot;Like Master Yi, Tryndamere could just use some more damage right now.&quot;_ I don&#039;t think that even warrants explanation, you all know what&#039;s wrong with that.\n\nThen we come to in my opinion, the worst change:\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/753ab652f9bf0201e8e87f99740cc40c.png\n\nNow to me, this change embodies a lot of Riot&#039;s current mentality towards the game.\nWe have a unique and interesting interaction, one that is used to make some pretty cool plays. Then you bring out something new, that makes the interaction perhaps a little too strong, so instead of trying to fix the problem, the first thing you do is just remove the interaction entirely. So now the game is minus yet another interesting playmaking tool. Much like Azir&#039;s wall, it was interesting and unique that it could stop dashes, but instead of trying to fix it, you just removed it all together, in favour of just piling more damage into his kit, _(which funnily enough is the mentality that brought about this god awful 1-hit meta)_.\n\nThen theres buffs to champs like Jhin and Viktor, both of which are huge bullies, and very oppressive champions, are you 100% sure they were absolutely top priority for buffs? You&#039;re sure there was no one else at all in the game that needed a buff or nerf more than them? Not Kalista, not Kindred, not the Nasus that wades through your whole team? No one? Jhin and Viktor were the absolute top of the pile for much needed buffs? If you say so....\n\nWhy are we getting all this unnecessary _(and blatantly backwards)_ crap, instead of focusing on the big issues right in from of our noses?\n\n____________________\n\n# What about glaring issues:\n\n\n\nWhat about the variety of runes champs can use?\nTake Gnar for example, he has the option of using: \n_Press the attack, Lethal Tempo, Fleet footwork, Eletrocute, Predator, Summon Aery, Arcane comet, Phase Rush, Grasp of the Undying, Unsealed spell book, Glacial Augment_ and _Kleptomancy._\nThats at least one _(but most of the time it&#039;s all of them)_ from all rune paths.\n\nHow about Nasus?: _Fleet Footwork, Predator, Dark Harvest, Phase rush, Grasp of the Undying, unsealed spell book, Glacial Augment, Kleptomancy._\nAgain, many options with at least one in every rune path, so you can adapt for whatever play style you feel comfortable with.\n\nLets take Taliyah now: \n_Electrocute, Summon Aery, Phase rush._\nWe get 3 options, from only 2 rune paths. And none of them are that great. Unlike thunderlords, Electrocute doesn&#039;t proc off individual rocks in her Q but treats all 5 rocks as 1 spell, so you have to hit your entire kit to take advantage of your rune, Phase rush is exactly the same. And while still useful, summon Aery doesn&#039;t enhance her kit in any way, like it does with poke mages such as Zoe. It just feels like a little extra damage tacked on. \n\nBecause it is &#039;adaptive&#039; damage, bruisers can have full access to the Sorcery line, as well as their own lines like precision and Resolve. Where most mages are almost exclusively limited to Sorcery, because they cant make use of attack speed or tanky runes.\nHow is that fair? Not to mention that Aery is a massive problem with top lane bruisers atm. Shouldn&#039;t these kind of things be the issues we try to address in the patches? Not buffing unkillable manaless champs with free crits?\n\nAnd the rune variety issue is just one of the many many issues cropping up these days.\n\nThis game makes me more and more furious by the day.\nThis was a such great game once, how has it fallen this far?\nIt&#039;s so infuriating.\n\n{{sticker:sg-shisa}}","replies":[{"poster":"Iudex Gundyr","date":"2018-02-07T03:37:29.849+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Azirs aa's never used to draw minion aggro (I was asking around my Azir main friends), it would have been a one off bug or other factors that would cause you to be aggro'd. \n\nTryndamere and Master Yi are weak champions, they need buffs. Their weaknesses are more glaringly obvious than Nasus' ;)\n\nI agree with you about the Ryze change. I REALLY dislike it. Removing a really big source of counter play in his kit is kind of dumb to me.\n\nJhin and Viktor are weak champions, both required buffs.\n\nKalista, Kindred and Nasus are kinda fine. Kalista could do with a small buff, and maybe Kindred too but Jhin/Viktor definitely higher priority.\n\nGnar can use PtA in specific scenarios, Fleet in specific scenarios, Aery and Grasp. The rest are shit or simply worse than the other options (e.g Aery > Comet).\n\nI'm not too familiar with rune choices for Nasus but Fleet/Grasp/Klepto seem the only good ones. The best Nasus player in OCE ONLY goes Grasp and Klepto for instance.\n\nTaliyah can go Electrocute, Aery, Comet, Phase, Spellbook but most only go Aery/Spellbook. \n\nYeah, there are problems in the game but Riot has to be super careful with what they put onto live, especially BIG rune changes that will change how a lot of champions are played for 100's of millions of people.\n\nMost top laners go Sorc, Resolve or Inspiration because Precision is generally for consistent damage output (ADCs, Yasuo etc), and Domination is for wanting to one shot people. Sorcery is literally \"Empowered abilities and resource manipulation\". Obviously aimed for Mages and people who do rely on abilities a lot. Such as Top laners. Resolve is for tanks, and Inspiration is for creative tools and such which almost all classes can use. Why are you not happy that they nerfed stopwatch and the problem Inspiration tree that 99% of the players love to complain about? You seem to think it's really easy to make runes that everybody can use thats all balanced on all champions and won't create a new type of Ardent Censor meta. Riot's doing a fine job aside from the Ryze thing which I'm sure they did for a reason. They're not that stupid (arguably). They know things we don't.\n\nThere are champions in the game that are quite weak and 1 or 2 who aren't op, but are quite unfun to play against for the majority of players. There are many issues in the game. You are complaining about mainly non issues because you seem to be incredibly biased and make posts off your own experience and feelings, relative to the majority of the playerbase or the design team for that matter.\n\nYou complained that Jhin (Silver tier on LoLalytics) and Viktor (Bronze tier on LoLalytics) got buffed yet 2 golds (Nasus, Kalista) and a platinum (Kindred) didn't get buffed/nerfed. (The tiers in LoLalytics are similar to Champion.gg's overall performance ranking but placed in a tier to help visualize).\n\nIt's hard to take your rant posts seriously sometimes.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-02-07T07:18:02.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For whatever reason, bug or not, Azir's autos always drew minion aggro, I've been an Azir main since the day he came out.\nThis is just the same as him having no cooldown on his W when casting on towers, I said it was a bug, and everyone (even other Azir mains) told me I was crazy and it had always had no cooldown.\n\nSure enough several months later when they bothered to fix it, they confirmed it was indeed a bug.\n\n----------------------------\n\nTheres no point taking comet on Taliyah, because the ability you use to engage knocks them out of the path of the comet...\nBut my point is not about specific champs but more so about what playstyle works for you personally, some classes such as bruisers get to choose between pretty much anything, e.g. Do you build Aatrox tanky or damage? Do you build Nasus full movement speed or resistances juggernaut, or even AP? \nYou get lots of choices with fighters, but with some classes such as Mage you pretty much only get 1 or 2 good runes to choose from. Hell most assassins pretty much can only go electrocute.\n\nAlso I put absolutely no stock in what some website decides to rank champs as, I base all of my opinions and descisions on actual experience I have through playing the game. And from what I see, Nasus is a monster 90% of the time, Kalista can't seem to kite effectively anymore due to the excess of movement speed in the game now, and the effectiveness of even minor slows on her dash,  and kindred can only get strong by running into certain death every 50 seconds to get marks she knows full well stopped being there the moment Lee Sin checked his map.\n\nI'm in silver, as is the vast majority of players, so using some stats from ranked pro and plat players means nothing to 90% of the community.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-07T07:28:56.513+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">Also I put absolutely no stock in what some website decides to rank champs as, I base all of my opinions and descisions on actual experience I have through playing the game.\n\nThis is fine, but in doing so you have to understand that your perspective on balance will be limited to your level of play, which is also fine, but it means you have to be that much more careful about making blanket or absolute statements. \n\nA change like a Yi or Tryndamere buff which will terrify the lower ranks because of their strength there, means absolutely nothing higher up because they just aren't played because there's someone who can do their job better (generally speaking). \n\nPlay differs significantly even from silver to gold, so if you're going to narrow your perspective to only your level of play, you have to accept that your opinions on balance are only ever going to be wholly relevant there.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-02-07T11:20:37.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Play differs significantly even from silver to gold, so if you're going to narrow your perspective to only your level of play, you have to accept that your opinions on balance are only ever going to be wholly relevant there.\n\nWell seeming my level of play _( mid-high silver)_ is where genuinely **HALF** of the population is at: https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/rankings/rank-distribution\nId say that blanket statements aren't too outrageous. Seeming at very least my observations will still be relevant to the **majority** of people.\n\nIm still an avid believer that the game should be balanced with a bit more of a focus on where the majority of players actually are playing. Not balancing the game around the few abnormally good players, which make up less than 10% of the population.\n\n_(and yes I understand the irony of saying I dont have stock in website stats, then using one to prove my point. However rank distribution is somewhat more factual and less subjective than ranking champion effectiveness.)_\n\nBut of course, unless you have a link to a Riot comment or Riot released stats, everything posted on the boards is some level of opinion, that is implied by default. So I never state that my views are fact, or even correct, they are simply observations, and observations that I feel are things that should be viewed a little closer by either the community or Riot. \n\n> A change like a Yi or Tryndamere buff which will terrify the lower ranks because of their strength there, means absolutely nothing higher up because they just aren't played because there's someone who can do their job better (generally speaking).\n\nSo why bother balancing Yi/Trynd at high elo at all?\nAll this buff does is, like you say, scare the shit out of over 70% of the population, and not affect the rest in the slightest. \nSo why not just balance those champs around low elo, seeming low elo is the only elo they actually get used in, and the elo where they most definitely do not need buffs. \n\nI feel like they should just balance champs like Sol/Kalista/Orianna etc. around higher levels of play, and stuff like Trynd/Yi/Garen etc. around low elo. Otherwise we get what we have now which is; some champs are too strong for low elo and never get played in high elo. and champs that are too strong for high elo, but too hard to play in low elo.. But that is a discussion for another time, I could go for hours on changes I would make to the balance system.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-07T11:43:15.037+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Balance isn't my strength in League, I'm far more interested in the behaviour side of things than the gameplay (hence I'm green and not blue) and I'm not anywhere near invested enough in the minutiae of the stats to really make any proper comments on balance as far as I'm concerned, but I'll do my best to explain.\n\nI was simply trying to forewarn you that people will disagree, and will have points that are just as valid as yours for where they are playing. I would challenge you to consider why a champion is strong at your level of play as deeply as you can. Take you recent Nasus post for example. For me, I find it a lot easier to not get salty about a particular champion if I understand why they are doing what they're doing, and in a lot of cases, those perspectives from different levels of play can give you insight into that.\n\nYou only get one ban, for me, it's Katarina, but that doesn't mean she's the only champion I don't want to verse in a game. I hate versing Blitzcrank, not because he's OP, but because he's cheesy. I can't ban him as well though, so instead I try to understand him. To keep it short I'll only state the obvious really, but once he's used his hook, that's all he's got for a long time. I play a lot of Nami, so I know that if I can Q their ADC as I'm getting hooked, Blitz is going to be pretty meaningless. If I get hooked, I know it's because I messed up, not because the champ was OP. It alleviates a lot of the salt for me.\n\nI agree to an extent that champs played in low elo should be balanced around low elo, but you also don't want to separate play too much. You don't want Silver to have a completely different roster of champions than Gold, because then someone who makes it into Gold mmr will immediately hit a brick wall and drop back down, at which point they have no opportunity to adapt to Gold level play, and so will never be able to climb.\n\nThe biggest thing in low elo that leads to a lot of \"x champion is OP\" instead of just \"I think x champion is a little overtuned\" is the inconsistency of play. Carrying one game and feeding the next means snowballing is the norm, and given that almost any champ that is stupid fed is going to feel OP, it's all exaggerated that much more.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-02-07T23:15:15.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course people will have just as valid (if not more so) points than I do. \nHowever I will continue to put my points forward until someone's point is valid enough to change my mind.\nBut so far, witnessing myself being 1-hit by a tank that I cannot kill or run from, has trumped any argument anyone has thus far put forth. Thats not to say I would not be swayed by a very convincing argument. But as of yet, no one has produced such an argument.\n\nSo far the typical response is: _\"But he isn't a problem in high elo.\"_\nTo which my response is: _\"So you're saying 1 in 10 people don't have a problem with him? Must be balanced then!\"_\n\nI understand full well why many champs are strong at low elo, I have never claimed to be the best player, I struggle with a fair few champs. And If it were just me struggling, then I wouldn't mention a thing, but when I see the same champions causing me and other players _(either on my team or not)_ to consistantly struggle too, thats when I think it might be a problem, and not just me, and make a post. \n\n\n________________\n\nTo me \"OP\" doesn't mean they have too much damage or are too tanky etc. To me, OP means that said champions have to put less effort in to have the same impact as other champions.\n\nLets use your example of blitz, I consider blitz to be a strong champion not because he has too much CC, or damage or whatever, but because to do his job, he spends less effort than in this case, Nami.\n\nBlitz can miss hooks for days, but when he does get one, either a kill is pretty much guaranteed, or summoner spells will be burst.  Nami on the other hand, can hit lots of bubbles, and other skills, and still not have the same effect.\n\nIf Nami wants to zone the enemy lane, she has to have had enough of a presence in lane to make the enemy afraid of her bubble. Where all blitz needs to do to zone the lane, is stand in the bush _(thats literally it, just stand in the bush, he doesn't even need to do anything in the bush, just stand in it, and the enemy will be too afraid to come near their minion wave, and if they do go to ward the bush, grab their ass!)_\n\nThats how I view \"OP\". Nasus is the same, his kit gives him less openings of weakness than other champs, it gives him tankiness, chase potential, damage, lifesteal, and thats all without even building items. Most champs don't get all those tools even at full build.\n\nSo its not that the champion itself is too strong, but it just offers opposing players less room to play against them. Which as you can understand, has much more of an impact in low elo where players such as myself don't have the skill to exploit as many weaknesses as higher elo players, therefore champions with less weaknesses such as Nasus and Fizz, become fed more often than champions who have more weaknesses such as Xerath or Ashe.\n\nEvery champion is OP when fed, You can be a fed Taric support and duel a Gangplank if you have enough gold. However what I consider to be OP is how often/easy it is for a champion to get fed. Fizz for example gets fed in low elo very frequently, so my thinking is: _\"Unless all the good players in my elo just happen to be fizz players.. maybe that champ has something other champs do not.\"_\n\nMake no mistake I have considered the whole picture, especially in relation to how champions perform in different elos, but I have chosen my stand. and I choose to  stand for balance where the vast majority of players are, instead of at the top of the tree where the anomalously good players are.\n\nWhy should all silver players struggle time and time again with shit like Yi and Trynd just so the diamond+ players can be happy?\nIt's like starving all the peasants just so the king can have a feast. Thats hardly the way to run country. Why should we run the game in the same way?

Champions can vary in effectiveness between elos, but tier lists are based off of win-rate, some use ban-rate and pick-rate aswell, but whatever the case they are always objectively the strongest champions for the patch. Players being at a worse standard making those champions not as good or worse champions better does not mean they should be adjusted accordingly...\n\nYour point about the majority opinion being important does hold some water, but instantly crashes when you realise that not all silver players are going to agree with you, you have formed your own opinions based on your own experiences as you said, and are now trying to dictate what is balanced well based off of that. I guarantee there is a silver player that thinks the exact opposite of everything you said because they have a keyhole perspective and most of them see the game different ways.\n\nIf you are throwing away statistics in favour of your own opinions and then expect Riot to make changes accordingly that's kind of embarrassing. Silver players generally lack game knowledge compared to higher elo players so how would they know what balance changes are the best? Taliyah needs a buff but you are out of your mind if you think the runes are trash on her. The only thing she misses out on is Storm-raiders Surge, but Phase Rush now means if you hit your entire combo you get the slow resistance. Aery is still very decent for the nature off her poke in lane, comet definitely works considering you are constantly q'ing, combined with its higher cooldown means you do get it off quite often. Electrocute is not the best especially since that tree isn't as desirable as other trees. Phase Rush can work if you need to be slippery inside late fights. (You should be landing your 3 part combo with ease late). Unsealed Spellbook is pretty strong for mages right now and gives Taliyah the ability to possibly take ignite, exhaust or tp early. \n\nThe truth is whether or not silver players are the majority, they are still bad and if you google the top win rate champions for a role and play one you like, you will have a higher chance of winning than someone playing a garbage tier champ. If you want to play the champion you exclusively love then go ahead but don't expect Riot to go in your desired direction with them. If anything these high win-rate champions are better in silver because they are naturally easier to play if they are op and very abuse-able.\n\nOf course, anyone can 1 trick a champion and get high elo if they are good enough, whether the champion is good or not. If you fail to climb with a certain champ you either aren't good at them or just aren't good in general. I have a friend that mained the old Urgot and got platinum 4 at his peak.

Azir is a good example because he spent a fair bit of his time (before the ult change) either useless or broken. Now I am not going to say his ult as is interesting as it was but now they can balance his damage a bit easier without worrying about theult making him impossible to play against. If they don’t make the change he spends the majority of his time as an under powered champion, interesting sure. But underpowered. Now I understand you were probably ok with that, but if he spent to long like that you probably would have people complaining about how weak Azir was. \n \nI completely understand what you’re saying. I still miss old Quinn, sure new Quinn does more damage is definitely a stronger champion. But it’s just not the same, sure it’s still fun to screen down the lane out 1000 miles an hour. But actually turning into Valour was great. With that being saidI understand why they made the change. In her old form she was definitely underpowered, but any attempt to buff her without the ult changes probably would have made her stronger than intended. \n \nYeah quite frankly I think those changes had been planned for a while. They were announced and pushed through so quickly there was no way Riot wasn’t already working on them before every lane started using spell thief’s. I don’t play a ton of support so I can’t comment on the effect but the intention (as far as I understand if from listening to stuff like the dive)bwas to free up some of the gold supports have to spend on site stone, to spend on other things. \n \nBut talking about spelltheifs let’s talk about what other things that could have been made. Because unless I missed the announcement, it hadn’t been buffed substantially before people started using it in other lanes. It was simply people adapting an item to the Meta. Now if you just nerf spelltheifs stats sure the other lanes might stop using it, but that would have hurt the supportsthat need it even harder and they weren’t in a great place at the time.Personally I would have dropped the gold gained from poking but upped the gold gained from other champions on your team last hitting minions near you. But inthat case you’re still weakening the supports who take it slightly.\n \nI’m not going to go into Adcs taking targons. That was probably more solvable, but like I said above, I’m pretty sure they had this in theworks for a while. You don’t just change every support item on the whim of theother lanes.\n\nAlso sorry for the wall of text ","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-02-06T23:20:39.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"not sure what you're getting at with the trynd and yi buffs","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2018-02-07T03:19:00.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Do yourselves all a favour and quit this god awful game, developers have drove it into the ground.","replies":[]}]}
