When he comes out of nowhere and 100-0&#039;s you, or you stand on a shroom and get half-healthed. Everyone just goes _&quot;fuckin Teemo, the little shit.&quot;_ and again no one cares or bothers to complain about it because you know everyones just like &quot;_Yea thats just Teemo, he&#039;s a shit, get used to it.&quot;_\r\nWhen if you stood on a Jhin or Nid trap and it half-heathed you, they&#039;d be disabled instantly!\r\n\r\nLee is obviously known for his constant godlike plays. Yet if most champs consistently made half the plays Lee does, they&#039;d be nerfed into oblivion! But because Lee is known for it, everyone is just like _&quot;Well yea, is just another lvl 7 Lee main, of course he&#039;s going to outplay us all without even trying. duh! he&#039;s FAKER OCE!!!&quot;_\r\n\r\nMeanwhile champs like Aatrox see the opposite end of the spectrum. The whole community has embraced the fact that Aatrox is just a joke of a champ who cant do much _(even though some of us actually really like him! :P)_. He isn&#039;t played, he&#039;s got an update coming sometime in the next couple of years, so people just sweep him under the rug and think _&quot;Oh yea.. he exists.. oh well. We will just deal with him when the eventual update comes around I suppose... no use thinking about him till then.&quot;_  so when just normal ADC&#039;s like Caitlin or Jinx  out-lifesteal him in games, people are just like  _&quot;Yea well... shouldn&#039;t of played Aatrox aye.&quot;_ and so again, nothing actually gets done. \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know the statistics on how often Vayne gets quadra or pentakills, but I can damn well guarantee that its a hell of a lot more than most champs. \r\nBut when she does get one, we all just sigh and go _&quot;Yup, thats just Vayne doing her thing.&quot;_\r\nAnd if you actually think about it; how can a champ who is not encouraged but _expected_ to get multi kills of this magnitude, possibly be healthy?\r\n\r\n\r\n______\r\n\r\n\r\n**So my question is: **\r\nAre champs whose essence are strongly associated with memes partially immune to criticism because of the stigma around them?\r\nand do they _(or the game)_ suffer a little because of this?\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, Yasuo is being changed, not because his statistics are OP, but because the community outwardly hates him so much that Yas players are physically incapable of picking their champ in ranked.\r\nWould Teemo or Irelia receive similar treatment if people bothered to show their true feelings about the champs, instead of withholding them because they knew their criticism would lead just to jokes. \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know the answer, I was thinking about it and thought it might be a neat talking point on the boards.\r\n\r\nHow much BS do we let slide because we have just come to expect it?","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-07-25T15:45:04.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://st.elohell.net/public/chill/38acd31fd436c4fb3bba6a6bae91c1ee.jpg\n\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Vd1JP56G2w/hqdefault.jpg\n\nr.i.p es numero uno","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-07-25T09:58:45.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Irelia and teemo both have their respective counters who can demolish them early game and stop them from doing anything throughout the rest of the game, but I do agree on Lee Sin though. Such an overlooked champion for a long time, nerfing his ult wasn't enough, it's his basic abilities that need adjusting.","replies":[]}]}
