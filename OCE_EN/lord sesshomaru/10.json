That is wayyyyyy too forgiving. I outplayed him twice, and he fucked up even after that, and he still comes out ahead...

If I get interrupted mid cast with Taliyah&#039;s ult, thats my bad for using it too close to the enemy. So how is it my fault if Darius fails to land the same piss-easy ult, 3 times? I used all the right tools at all the right times, and he fails to do so, **3 times!** Why does he not suffer any penalty for that, when I lose everything?\n\nThis is why I campaign for counterplay.\nThe tools for nullifying Darius&#039; ult exist within the game, yet even using them at the right time fails to do so. Most champions don&#039;t have any ability at all that will save them for his ult, I pick a champion that can have 2! and neither of them are useful in the slightest.\nThere are not many tools that can counter Darius&#039; ult, but the few that can, **should** be able to.\n\nHaving the tools in the game but not making them effective, is like Riot giving the president a bulletproof car, but rolling the windows down...","replies":[{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2018-05-20T05:40:55.905+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats darius for you","replies":[]},{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2018-05-20T06:30:55.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It’s simply because the jump is just a wind up animation, if the target becomes untargetable then the ability never goes off hence why he can keep ulting","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-05-20T10:09:48.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To me that just seems morally wrong.\nOnce you press the button _(doesn't matter what champ you are)_, you should have committed to using that ability. \nJust because you made a poor judgement call and ulted too late, doesn't mean you should get any special treatment.\n\nVeigar cant suck his ult back into his body if the target disappears before it hits.

Your comparing apples to oranges. Darius is a champ that lacks 0 mobility and 0 hard cc outside of his fairly simple to dodge grab. Making it super easy to kite him. Also it’s not that  he ulted wrong it’s that the animation never finished. The same thing happens to lux if you use her ult and it gets canceled it doesn’t go on cd. If the animation doesn’t finish the game goes oh your ult can’t be used in this instance for x reason so there for it’s canceled and it doesn’t  go on cd","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-05-20T13:50:21.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only way to cancel Lux's ult is for her to die during the cast, and it definitely goes on cool down.\n\nIm sorry if you dont like the examples, but there aren't many other single targeted execute-esq ults around.\n\nAlso mobility and CC have nothing to do with anything, this is a basic principle of how the game functions, having CC doesnt mean the logic of the game should work any different.\nMost champions, once you press the button, thats it, your ability is used, even if you die before any animation has happened at all. _(A couple of times as Sol I've press R, died in the same split-second, absolutely no sound effect or animation has played, and my R goes on full cooldown.)_\n\nUnless specifically stated otherwise (like Caitlin's R), once an ability is pressed, that should be it, no exceptions.\n\nIf they put in Darius' tooltip _\"Refunds full cool down if animation is not completed\"_ and explain their reasoning, then ill accept it.

Veigar ult gains for damage the less hp his target has. Syndra ult gains bonus damage based on the balls she has spawned. And brand ult can apply blaze which is his passive not his ult. if you want single target execute champs who where better off picking cho’gath, garen or urgot. \n\nBasically it’s like this Darius ult jump is purely for cosmetic so if he didnt have that jump the skill would be instant and it would have hit u anyway and that’s why it doesn’t go on cd","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-05-21T10:03:32.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I am well aware of how all of their ults function.\nIts not about being an 'execute' necessarily, its about being an ability that functions a similar way.\n\nall the ults i mentioned function in the same way in the sense that they are all single target moves used in similar situations to Darius' ult, _(i.e most of the time they are used for getting the kill. not for engages etc etc.)_, they all have a single damage instance preluded by a cast animation.\n\nI could have mentioned Garen and Cho'gath, however I don't know wether their ults reset in the same way as Darius' does. And I'm not going to make a statement using them to back my point up if I don't know if they even function the same way. \nDo you know?\n\nUrgots's ult is completely different, it follows none of the same rules as Darius', I don't know why its even relevant?\n\nDarius's jump does not contribute to the damage of his ult its true. But that doesn't mean it doesn't have a purpose. Its a visual indicator that lets other players see what is going on during a fight _(if he didn't jump and you just died randomly in a spurt of blood in the middle of a team fight as soon as he clicked on you, you'd find it a little confusing.)_. So its purpose is to give visual indication of his action, and the action is: He has pressed R.\n\nIf we are talking purely about animations; Aurelion Sol's ults, he has a windup animation where he rears back his head and gets ready to spout fire. If he dies before he shoots, his ult still goes on cool down.\nSo having an visual animation before the ability does damage, does not mean the ability has not been used.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-05-20T07:35:59.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, you're too engrossed in thinking that Zhonya's and Vlad's W is indeed a counter to Darius' R.\n\nIt's as simple as: it's not.\n\nSomething like Fiora's W is an outplay device for Darius' R.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-05-20T09:57:44.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=kaboomblah,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=xdgi2rz4,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-05-20T07:35:59.603+0000)\n>\n\n> It&#x27;s as simple as: it&#x27;s not.\n\n_Obviously_....\n\nMy point is that it **should** be.\n\nOther champs, once you press the button, you've committed to using your ability, for better or worse. I don't see any feasible reason why Darius should have any special treatment? Should Veigar's ult reset if you Zhonyas before it hits you?\n\nAnd I don't buy the _\"It has counterplay. You just have to be the one champ in the game with the single ability that blocks it.\"_ speal _(for any champ, not just Darius)_. One champion, i.e. Fiora, with one of her abilities i.e. W, does not provide significant enough counterplay to justify being a champ's weakness.\n\nSkillshots are countered by mobility.\nMobility is countered by AoE.\nAoE is countered by range.\nRange is countered by Mobility.\nTank is countered by sustained damage.\nSustained damage is countered by burst.\nBurst is countered by tank.\n\nThese things are general, not champ specific. So as a general rule, champions with higher mobility are a rough counter for every champ that relies on skill shots. So if Ezreal is trying to slap you with his Q, even champs that dont have dashes can still move and weave about. That is counterplay. Specific champs with specific abilities _(e.g. Fiora's W)_ that nullify another specific champion's ability (e.g Darius' R), is counter-picking, not really counterplay.\n\nNo matter how many movement speed items you buy, you cant move and weave out of Darius' R, therefore there should be another  general method to avoid it _(no ability should be unavoidable and unblockable, therefore must have a counter)_. And one would assume that becoming invulnerable the second before it slams into your face, would suffice.","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-05-20T11:33:51.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get what you're saying. His R is largely unavoidable, and there's no punishment for misusing it. Trust me, he NEEDs that to be the case. Have you ever seen a late-game Darius? You just point and laugh.\n\nYou used Veigar's R as a counter example.\n\nLet me tell you why Darius needs a cannot-be-whiffed ultimate. And why there needs to be a significant risk associated with Veigar's R.\n\nDarius is a lane bully, and he has this enormous early power spike, one or two items in. Like, absurd to the point where he can - if slightly fed - 1v2 easily, 1v3 viably, 1v4 possibly, and even 1v5 is improbable, not impossible. Darius' objective is draw an inordinate number of enemy Champs to deal with his arse, or group to shit on the enemy to take everything off the map and end it relatively early. If the game goes on, Darius is a weak-arse piece of shit that gets 1v1'ed by the enemy ADC. He, believe it or not, NEEDS that un-whiffable R, along with its rests, to remain a viable Champion.\n\nVeigar, however, has a kit that enables 3/4 abilities to scale without end, and allows his W and R reach one-shot-anything heights. It needs to be whiffable. Imagine it being like Darius'. You walk up to Anivia, press R. She Zhonya's. Your R doesn't go on cooldown. You wait. Press R. KFC. It'd be game-breaking.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-05-20T14:11:21.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This post was intended not to be so focused on Darius specifically, but rather on the clarity of what you expect when you outplay something.\n\n_e.g. if I see an ability coming at me, if I Zhonyas to block it, I expect not to see the same ability immediately fly at me again.  Whats the point of even having invulnerability then? _\n\nAll abilities should follow the same base logic without fail unless they have a specifically stated exception to that logic _(e.g. Vayne's silver bolts not stacking on Runaans, or Caitlins' ult having a reduced CD if the target disappears before she shoots.)_ Otherwise everything should follow the same rules. Either Everyone's ult resets if it gets Zhonyased, or no one's does.\n\n_________________\n\nAlso, Ive seen too many Darius' fed or otherwise absolutely steamroll late-game to believe that he is weak enough to be laughable. He's one of those champs who gets too tanky for a damage dealer, and has too much damage for a tank. That is always a strong combo. Like Nasus, yes he isn't a problem to take down, the thing is, it takes long enough to take him down that the enemy Vayne has already taken out the majority of the team. and like Nasus, you cant just leave him to do his own thing, because then he's the one taking out your whole team.\n\nHe has a ranged pull, 2 slows, one of them a brutal as fuck, phage, ghost, and sometimes even phase rush. Not to mention one of the highest base movement speeds in the game. \n**Kite that shit my ass.**\n\nIt's like following a cookbook recipe, the guide _says_ its easy and shows a lovely picture of a cake, but in reality, it looks like a cow-pat, and tastes just as bad, even though you followed all the steps.\n\nPersonally I don't care wether its Veigar, or Darius, or fricken Udyr for that matter, as soon as you press the button, that ability is used. Full stop. If you happen to use it wrong, or someone outplays it, tough luck, you needed to play better.\n\n________________\n\nI just hate the direction this game keeps going.\nI miss the days before juggernauts, when there was _**Tank**_ at one end of the scale, and _**Damage**_ at the other. and all champs fell somewhere in-between. the tanker they were, inversely the less damage they had, the more damage they had, the easier they were to kill. It was all proportionate.\nThat scale no longer exists. :/\n\n_[Sigh]_","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-21T02:14:36.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not gonna get too involved in this, because I've beaten and lost to enough Darius..es that I see both sides, but also don't pretend to be a qualified balance expert, or even really hobbyist. I would suggest considering player skill as a factor however.\n\nYour cake metaphor though, could easily argue against you. It could be a shit recipe that's always possible, and the end result will always turn out shit, but realistically nobody is going to post a crap recipe online and see it sticking around anywhere for very long (and same goes for guides). More likely that recipe does in fact result in that beautiful cake, but a step or two (or 7) has been missed (by recipe or by user) somewhere along the way.\n\nPerhaps the recipe assumes you know x thing to complete step 7, but you don't so you misinterpret it. Perhaps it told you to bang the cake mix on the counter at step 9 and you thought that was probably unnecessary and didn't do it because of the noise, when realistically for some cakes it's essential. Perhaps the recipe just said flour but really meant self raising flour and you don't know enough about cakes to notice the error.\n\nPerhaps in the end, it does just come down to Darius being better at making an easier cake. Your more complex cake (higher skill cap champs) might have tasted better if you made it perfectly, or perhaps your audience didn't like chocolate (counter picks) and that's largely why he won.\n\nCertain players are just better than you. I consider myself a pretty good support for my tier, but I know when I'm beat. More importantly because it's my main role and usually my main champions I know *why* I'm beat as well. More often than not, the enemy is just better.\n\nConsider for a moment that you play mid, and largely immobile mids as well. You are at a disadvantage, both in in depth knowledge because you don't play Darius or top lane, and in champion because Darius excels against non mobiles and struggles against the opposite. Consider that when people say kite him, they are typically speaking from an ADC (+ support) or team standpoint.\n\nIf you're consistently going into games against a Darius as champions like Zoe or Aurelion with very little mobility and relatively little CC of course you are going to be a target. The rest comes down to teamwork, positioning and vision.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-05-21T04:10:32.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand what you're saying completely, and I agree.\nI always take my own (and others) skill into consideration. Its the first thing I think whenever I die.\n\ni.e. I would never come crying to the boards because I lost a single game _(or even several games)_ against a certain champion. That could very well be because I'm fighting people that are just simply better than me, _(its always a 50/50 chance)_.\nI only come here to make a statement when I encounter the same issue consistently.\n\n________________________\n\nIt could very well be that I have sub-par understanding of Darius and his mechanics, and so naturally my cake will turn out worse than someone with more experience with/against him.\n\nHowever considering I am far from the only player who has consistent troubles with Darius, I think that it is somewhat more likely that the champ itself has aspects that are too strong. Rather than every Darius I happen to see, just so happens to be a better player than me and my whole team.\n\nand its not like Darius is a complete mystery to me just because I main mid. Ive been playing the game for years and years, and have played as/with/against Darius enough to have a pretty damn solid grasp of what he can and cant do. So its not like I'm playing blind into him. But knowing he has triple my HP and pretty much the same damage output, hardly makes it any easier.\n\nBut me fighting Darius isn't the problem, Im well aware that most mages are countered by fighters and assassins, so when I struggle against them, it doesn't bother me too much. Its when I see fighters like Darius or assassins like Zed still being a problem for the rest of the team even after killing me. Thats when I smell a rat.\nAs someone like Swain or Azir, I can usually fend Darius off long enough in a 1v1 situation to gain the upper hand. But the game isn't a 1v1. and Darius is very strong in a team-fight.\n\n1. Because he has lots of damage, that is also AoE/Multi-target.\n2. He is hugely tanky, and heals basically half of his HP back with every Q, so you need multiple people and significant time in order to kill him.\n3. The weakness everyone blabs about _(being able to kite him)_ is rendered useless, because they ADC _(and most others)_ are focusing on trying to kill the fed Vayne and Yasuo. Not on kiting the tank.\n\n________________\n\nAnd of course I know that when people talk about kiting him, they are referring to the ADC.\nBut that in itself isn't very strong counterplay _(only 1/5th of the team can actually exploit it)_. And even then, maybe champs like Vayne or Ezreal could manage it. But id pay good money to see your everyday Kog'Maw kite a Darius with a hard-on for him. \n\nEven if 'kiting' is referring to multiple people (like ADC + Support) thats BS counterplay: \"_Yea you can counter him, but only if you have a bunch of people, against just his one person.\"_ What I would give for Sol's main counterplay to be: _\"You just have to 3v1 him.\"_\n\nTo kite someone, you have to play perfectly, for a decent length of time.\nAll Darius needs to do is catch up to you once. Once. and youre gone.\nIts hardly counterplay ,when to counter the counterplay is easier than the counterplay itself.\n\n_____________________________\n\n**So really, Darius' counterplay is:**\nIf youre not the ADC don't even try, and if you happen to be lucky and be the 1/5 of the team that is the ADC, and also happen to be one with lots of mobility. You just have to play perfectly for a length of time to kite him, while everyone else on the other team is also trying to kill you too, all while not being hit once by Darius.\n\n\n\n#Compare that 'weakness' to _**actual**_ counterplay like Sol's Stars, Kindred's marks, or Jhin's reload time, and it begins to look pretty suspect.\n\nBut this is getting a little off topic, the issue I was pointing out was not that Darius is strong, its that abilities _(wether Darius' or not)_ shouldn't reset just because someone else out-played it. Darius is only part of the conversation because the example I used happened to be of him.\n\n_Apologies, you said you didn't want to get too involved, but like usual I get carried away and write a lot xD_","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
