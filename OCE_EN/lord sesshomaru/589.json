I&#039;m going to duo with someone I&#039;ve played with before and thought they were polite and fun to be with. \r\nBut now, by duoing with them, I can&#039;t reward them for their behaviour. \r\n\r\nHonour should go to the person you think is most deserving.\r\nWhat if your duo **WAS** the most deserving on your team?\r\n\r\nYou now either have to honour someone who was less deserving _(thus ruining the point of the honour system)_, or waste your honour on someone who receives no benefit from it at all _(thus ruining the point of the honour system)_. \r\nIt&#039;s pointless. \r\n\r\nMore often than not, your duo **will be** the most positive person on the team _(because thats why you choose to duo with them in the first place!)_. So now by duoing with them, you actually reduce their chances of climbing the honour tree. \r\n\r\n________\r\n\r\nYes I know, people would take advantage of that and just spam honour their friends. But if we look at it, is that even that bad?\r\nIf they actually don&#039;t deserve the honour and keep misbehaving, then no matter what honour level they are, they will be dragged down to 0 eventually, and if they do deserve honour, then why shouldn&#039;t their friend honour them? They deserve it.\r\n\r\nPeople are always going to be able to take advantage of the systems, that&#039;s just the way the world is. Basically anywhere in life that there is a system, there are people taking advantage of it. Homeless people go commit crimes so they can be put in a nice safe jail cell with 3 meals a day and a warm bed to sleep in, paid by us tax payers. Murderers and rapists get off scott free because the lawyer found some loophole in the legal system. \r\n\r\nIn theory, I could go and pay a diamond player to smurf and duo with me to carry me up the ladder. Im technically being boosted, but I&#039;m pretty sure there is no premise to ban my account because my account itself hasn&#039;t done anything illegal, because I&#039;m not sharing my login details.\r\n\r\nIf you really want to, you&#039;ll find a way to beat the system. \r\nWhy disadvantage the regular players because a couple of people will beat the system?","replies":[]}
