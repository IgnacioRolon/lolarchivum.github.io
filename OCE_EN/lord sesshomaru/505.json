Yet Teemo, Veigar and Yi are 3 champs that have loads and loads of skins and all 3 get legendary skins.\r\nnow im not complaining at all, i love those 3 skins (hate teemo and yi the champs but love the skins) I&#039;m just curious\r\n\r\nhow come you remove skins from champs that have very few and add skins to champs that have heaps?","replies":[{"poster":"Infected Walnut","date":"2015-08-24T14:09:56.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"teemo, yi, and veigar are older champions.\nobviously most older champions are going to have more skins than newer champions.\nmore popular champs are also going to have more skins.\nand they're not removing the skins, they're putting them in the legacy vault because they're not to the current standard of skins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ravenn","date":"2015-08-24T13:50:07.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are multiple reasons why.\nUsually skins come out as a set\ne.g the current \"Arcade\" set or the \"championship\" set along with the Pool Party set and the upcoming \"Project\" skin set\nWhile there are champions with few skins, when Riot wants to release a Skin set the champion must fit the.. \"theme\"? of the skin set along with other factors.\n\nThen again this is just perspective and talking about skins that come out as a set.\nthis probably didn't help answer your question but hey, Funfacts with Ravenn 101~","replies":[]}]}
