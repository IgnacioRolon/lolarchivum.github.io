The damage is only a small factor of what makes that ult great. It can allows you to get to the backline pretty safely.","replies":[{"poster":"Manyula","date":"2015-10-21T05:04:10.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"oh yeah? Tell me more MR bronzelord Vi main.

I never said vi didn't stick to champions. When was the last time you were fighting a person in melee and you ulted them. Vi's ult is usually to gap close onto their backline, and you try to position it so that you hit as many people on your way there. \n\nBut i guess personal attacks are easier than playing the champion. MR no vi games. Also consider this, ranked isn't the only way to play this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Manyula","date":"2015-10-22T08:57:34.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranked is the only thing that matters.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-10-23T10:49:05.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"'Mattering' is a matter of perspective, if you don't care about being ranked in a system that is technically useless unless you're in the top 1% then ranked doesn't matter.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-10-20T23:52:39.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The first time, i just needed to get close to her to try save my ally, and she was about to go out of range so it was my only option. the second time she ulted while i was in mid ult.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-10-21T13:17:34.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its supposed to, because poppy ult stops other's cc aswell, and your ult is counted as cc and damage, so it will cd without damage and cc","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-10-21T18:53:35.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea it should cancel the damage and cc, but not stop me dashing to her.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-10-22T07:16:19.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you never said anything about that, you just said before, never instant stop, before would sound more like getting infont of her and stopping","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-10-22T08:49:36.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"your ult starts, then stops before you hit her\"\n\n\"but its not supposed to stop your ult as soon as it starts without even dashing.\"\n\ni did say it","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-10-22T09:21:36.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"go on edit stuff and say you did it, still doesn't make a difference","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-10-23T10:45:55.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hahaha i haven't edited anything, don't blame me if you didn't read it right the first time xD","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2015-10-20T22:03:27.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm very strange...
