However i was flying through the river and hit a shroom and was slowed but did not exit the tag team, this happened on multiple occasions.\r\n\r\nP.S. Quite happy to keep it how it is (fuck teemo) but thought i would bring it to attention, as i don&#039;t want to win by taking advantage of bugs.","replies":[{"poster":"gilghost","date":"2016-03-08T17:36:48.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:119}} {{item:3024}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-21T11:13:25.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well, pets (which is whats teemo's r is classified as (who knows god god damn why)) dont exit tag team, only damage directly from the champ cancels it","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-11-21T11:31:22.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Technically, Teemo's shrooms are classified as traps, but only champion/turret damage causes Tag Team (or should I say \"Behind Enemy Lines\", wtf Rito?) to end. I think it's a little vague though because Teemo's shrooms are still his damage. If traps/pets from champions don't cause Tag Team to end it should be specified somewhere, after all Riot is all about Clarity...","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-21T11:50:52.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes, but \"traps\" are also registered as \"pets\" by the tag team code. \n\nShaco w, Heimer q, teemo r etc, dont seem to cancel it, as well as debuffs that don't actually bring harm to quinn, such as fiddle's q or fizz r (before shark attacks)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
