Even she is very unreliable though. Pretty much any of these champions will either do nothing or everything and they are game changing either way. If they don't snowball they suffer so badly you're basically fighting one teammate down, and if they do snowball then they become nigh unstoppable killing machines.\n\nThe only reason I consider Kat better than the others is that there is counterplay there. Even if she snowballs, you just save up that CC, but I still think she either needs a resource pool or changes like these so she isn't just a \"get two kills early > mash face on keyboard > win\" champion. Rengar and Talon will be in the middle of your team with half of you dead before you even know they're there nevermind able to CC them.\n\nThe Assassin update is sorely needed, and while I don't know if all of these changes will work out, (the Zed ones especially I am sceptical of but I will withhold judgement till we see full stat adjustments) I completely believe that they will at the very least put these champions in a better place to be retuned and balanced than they are at the moment. These changes give these champs ways to make cool and effective plays regardless of whether they're fed to high heaven or not, and will hopefully create gates for Riot to tone things down when they are are.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"gravityhacker","date":"2016-10-18T22:29:32.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TANK META BOYS (this is how you get a tank meta again)","replies":[{"poster":"Frommo","date":"2016-10-19T03:04:53.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lethality, ensures it won't be tank meta due to the scaling pen so assassin's can keep up with turtling tanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-10-19T23:05:56.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and arguably tanks weren't a solution to zed anyways because I remember getting 1 shotted by a full combo from a full build armour pen zed once as a full build full armour (since they had no ap) Nasus.
