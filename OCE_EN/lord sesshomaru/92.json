The game is super snowbally due to gold on the map.\n2. Normals MMR is fucked atm, not entirely sure why but i think they did a reset on it like 6 months ago.\n3. Lane dominance generally means that the person is better then the other.\n\nSo basically it becomes whoever wins 2/3 lanes wins, because generally speaking the keystones and the sheer gold available in those lanes makes it impossible for 1 lane to fully carry the entire game.\n\nBecause of the gold value in the Keystones as well a lot of cases people will get ahead and be able to skip to the damage items over say the lifesteal (ADC's) as lifesteal is now basically in built.\n\nCurrent tower worth: 775 (125 each and 150 split for nearby people)\n\nAnd the jungler has to gank to get global gold because they can't get dragon to do so (A reason as to why junglers can't pull from behind because of turret gold.).\n\nAnd on top of this a lot of people are buying guinsoo's which is worth 6k gold and costs 2.5k, so that just scales gold worth as well (there are a few items that are extremely efficient right now.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-11-18T10:12:46.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've actually had a few games where we started 0-10 and team was saying GG - game over fed(whoever fed) - GG no kills or objectives.\n\nThen we actually started using teamwork we took baron and we won.

Riot made it super snow bally by making the turrets super weak and making vision control harder to maintain.\n\nBut thats why its preseason. To test if sht works or not. Next patch they are making turrets a little tougher and lowering the XP you get from kills to try and stop the probably 18 minute average games right now.\n\nAccording to Reinboom there were also changes to how XP is calculated in this patch that weren't in the patch notes which also led to people who get early kills getting a pretty much a full level lead.
