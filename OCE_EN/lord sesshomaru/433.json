It also depends on your cultural background as well as any other languages you may speak. However, even though I go between pronunciations, I still try to be correct and use the Riot given pronunciations, unless they're wrong (see note: Xin Zhao) often with names inspired by other languages.\nPersonally I say: Ta-leigh ah, Nas-zeus, Cam-eel & Shack-o (mostly)","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-14T02:03:52.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ahhh ok, i try to change Nas-zeus to Nay-zeus some of the time, but generally say something halfway between the two and get my tongue tied up xD\n\nIts interesting that you view the riot pronunciation as 'correct' (as in, thats the one true way to say it) you don't just think its just the difference between Tomato (toe-may-toe) instead of Tomato (toe-mah-toe)? where both are correct, but some people say it one way and some say it the other. \n\nIm not sure which one i think it is actually. xD","replies":[{"poster":"Ceness","date":"2016-12-14T09:06:26.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did say that I generally use the Riot pronunciation, however there are many cases when they are wrong often with names based off of other languages.
