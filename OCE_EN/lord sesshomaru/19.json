Because all that most people care about is dealing as much damage as quickly as possible, and are blind to other more tactical possibilities however strong they are.\n\n2. because if you're a normal AP mage your only viable options are deathfire and thunderlords, (now refer to reason 1)\n\n3.

And this really bugs me, I don't actually think Thunderlord's is OP, I agree with Rito on that, but a lot of people, don't even read patch notes, so they'll have no idea that the other masteries got buffed and most of them just don't care since they just want the damage. What they don't know is, taking Thunderlord's on **full** tank Malphite is no where near as good as taking Grasp of the Undying since you're not building any Attack Damage or Ability Power, whereas you ARE building health,  which is what Grasp of the Undying scales off of, so while Thunderlord's base damage is still very good, you aren't maximising your builds by taking it if you aren't going to help it scale. Same goes for Cinderhulk Junglers! Strength of the Ages directly compliments Cinderhulk and Thunderlord's doesn't compliment you unless you're planning on building damage later on.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sailor Jupiter","date":"2016-01-14T09:48:13.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give it some time, the patch just hit and it will take a while for everyone to feel out the changes to the masteries.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-01-14T08:12:42.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm so sick of seeing thunderlords on almost every player they just need to nerf it for gods sake :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gaslight","date":"2016-01-14T06:33:23.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People were picking Thunderlords because Precision was broken.
