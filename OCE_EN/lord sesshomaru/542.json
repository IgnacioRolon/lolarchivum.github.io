It got rid of ARAM smurfs, and gave us more variety in every day ARAM games.\nNot to mention that the current system disadvantages players who have spent time and money unlocking all the champions. \n\nBut I haven&#039;t heard a peep about it in so long. _(and for a change that would be so easy to implement, that usually means it&#039;s dead.) _\nIts unfortunate, but id kinda like to know what it was that stopped it, if anyone has some information on it, I would love to hear it. \n\n_________\n\nI was looking at the stats a while ago _(unfortunately i cant find them now, because lolking has changed, and now i cant find anything..)_ But it is quite significant how many more times people get champions like Blitz and Teemo, than they do champions like Kindred and Nunu.\nAnd thats because everyone owns Blitz/Teemo etc, but not as many people own Kindred/Taliyah etc etc. \n\nPeople who have very few champions _(either out of choice, or because they are new)_ continuously get the same champions over and over again (and are usually champions that they play normally too). While people who have most or all of the champions, almost never get a champion that they are familiar with. \n\nIn addition apart from giving an advantage to some people and not others, it just stagnates the game, blitz is seen again and again, and no one wants that  _(if we want to see tons of Blitz we can just play normals.)_\n\n______\n\nIn theory, in a mode that is Random, all champions should have a roughly equal pick rate. \nIt seems to be a logical move. But that isn&#039;t what is in the game, which means there must be some major reason that I&#039;m not aware of!\n\nJust wondering what it is.\nif anyone knows, I would much appreciate the knowledge ^^\nthanks","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-12-16T10:19:23.762+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot just never implemented it.\n\nThe biggest issue tends to be ARAM specific accounts.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-17T01:10:26.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why didn't they implement it though?\nThere must be a reason.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BananaSlayerAMO","date":"2016-12-16T23:41:06.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"While unlocking the entire champion pool might benefit some experienced players, it makes it hard for newer players. IMO, as someone who started the game by playing a lot of ARAM, being forced to learn a new champ almost every game would not be fun. I don't believe that ARAM should be limited to experienced players, which is why I support the way it is now.\n\nAlso, players owning very few champions don't have much of an advantage at all as they are much more susceptible to the free champ rotation. In fact, I think that having a large champ pool reduces the randomness of the rotation and allows people to frequently get champs that they own. This is a significant advantage, **IF** people actually know how to play the champions that they bought.\n\nTake my words with a grain of salt, as I may be the owner of an 'ARAM-specific' account. But I don't think its a problem that I only buy champs that I am confident in and happy to receive in ARAM. You obviously have not done the same; I'm not saying that you should, but to consider the people that have.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-12-17T00:57:29.353+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ARAM is supposed to be about playing champs you wouldn't normally play, not playing champs that you only know how to play.

So you do have to make a choice:\nDo we disadvantage the vast majority of players, just to please the small amount of new players? Or do we disadvantage the small minority, in order to make the game better for the majority of loyal players?\n\nIt a tricky decision, but In my opinion, the majority should win out in this case. \n\nPlus, it isn't _that_ detrimental to new players.\n\n1. New players will be learning on Summoners Rift first anyway, and by the time you get to play ARAM, they are not as \"new\" as you think.\n2. Its a good way for new players to try out champions that they might consider buying.\n3. It gives them a break from playign the 6 (or whatever) champions that they have been able to afford thus far.\n\nThats how I see it anyway, but there are different perspectives on it I'm sure!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-17T01:11:20.402+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.\nEveryone being random, creates an even playing field to have fun on.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-17T01:07:12.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats a very fair point, it would be very off-putting to new players to have to learn new champions every single game _(especially because the hard champions like Azir and Kalista would be more readily available, than they would be otherwise)_ Thats a very valid point!\n\nI guess my main issue is just a variety one. It gets very old for everyone, having to VS Blitz/Veigar/Teemo in every 2nd or 3rd ARAM. You never get the opportunity to VS champs like Aurelion Sol, Taliyah, Ivern, Quinn, even Lissandra (even though its HER map.)\nalso, people never get the chance to play those champs either. People just get stuck in the same cycle of playing the same old champions time and time again. \n\nI could so easily make a new account, buy Azir, Sol, Taliyah, and a couple of other champs that I'm good with. And just have a 50% chance of getting either my mains or a free-week champ. (and 50% is a lot better than a 1 in 133 chance.) \nBut i just cant rationalise that as 'fair'. Everyone else is getting random champs, likely ones that they have hardly ever used before, and here i am constantly getting champions that i have over 100,000 mastery points on. I cant see that in any other way than 'cheating'.\n\nIt fully defeats the purpose of an All **Random** game. \n\nLet me put it this way: Artifically decreasing the chance of getting a bad hand in a game of chance (like gambling in a card game), IS cheating. Why is doing the same in League, not cheating? \n\nIf you are playing ARAM You accept the fact that you may very well get a champion that you have never played before, its a fun game mode, you're not supposed to feel 'confident' or 'strategise' you're supposed to get a random champ, and do the best you can with them, just chucking your spells into an infinite teamfight.\n\nI also don't quite understand what you say about having more champs increases your chances of getting one you're good with?\nHaving a new account with ONLY the champs youre good with, gives you wayyyy more chance of getting them _(yes you have to deal with the free-rotation champs. but so does someone with all of the champs.)_ Mathematically, you are more likely to get good champions, if you only have good champions. There is no disadvantage to that. \n\nI can understand both sides of the argument. I truly do. \nBut in a game of \"randomness\" i believe everyone should be on the same playing field. \nOtherwise its not actually 'random'.","replies":[{"poster":"BananaSlayerAMO","date":"2016-12-17T04:33:37.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I also don't quite understand what you say about having more champs increases your chances of getting one you're good with?\n\nI meant that a player who owns many champs has a much smaller chance of getting a champ from the free rotation. This decreases the chance of getting a champ that they might not have played before. For example, a person owning 40 champs has less than 20% chance of getting an unowned champ whilst someone owning 10 has about 50% chance.\n\nThe meaning of ARAM is pretty subjective; I think it fulfils the part of providing a range of different experiences, although you're right about the equality part.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-17T05:38:01.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats true, but when you start getting to having a high number of champions, it usually means that you've played a lot of champions as well _(because you would have seen many free-rotations over your time playing.)_ so getting a champ from the free rotation doesn't necessarily mean getting a champion that you've never played before.  \n\nAlso you might have 40 champs, but only know how to play 15 of them, which means that having higher number of champions is detrimental. I for example have all the champions, I have played all of them, but i know some far far far better than others.\nIf I got Vayne (who I own) I would be in exactly the same boat as a new player who got Vayne from the free rotation. \nJust because you have lots of champs doesn't mean that you are competent with all of them, so the more you have, the higher the chance of having receiving one that you aren't competent with.\n\nWhich in my opinion is half the fun though! As much as I would love to get my main on ARAM, I can play them anytime on Summoners Rift anyway, so there isn't much point. Its far more fun in my opinion, to have a joy ride with a champ that you don't often get the chance to play. BUT it does decrease the fun somewhat, when you are having fun joy-riding a champion you never play, but are fighting against lvl 7 Blitz and Veigars. \n\nYou are right, ARAM is very subjective, and people play it for lots of different reasons, _(I personally play it mostly because its shorter, and sometimes you dont have much time)_ but some people play it very competitively, some prefer it to Summoners Rift, and others use it only when ranked is down. \n\nBut what isn't subjective is its name \"All Random, All Mid\" Which means that it should be 'random' champions. Not randomness for some people, and controlled randomness for others. \n\nIts not equal when someone has to pick a card from a deck of 52, and others have to pick a card from a pile of Aces.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-12-16T13:25:03.183+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tbh the issue isnt that prevalent in my opinion.\n\nThen again i treat aram more as a combination of \"i want to have fun\" and \"i want to rehash on my champion knowledge by forcing myself to play a champ i dont normally play\"\n\nSo it doesnt bother me much if people get their mains","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-17T01:10:02.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not so much people getting their mains that I'm worried about.\n\nIts that you see far more of some champions than others (purely because more people own Blitz than Urgot), and for a game that is 'random' that should not be the case.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-12-17T01:43:08.589+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Urgot rekts shop more than Blitz though.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-17T01:59:18.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True :P \n\nbut very few will ever know that, because no one ever sees him :P","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
