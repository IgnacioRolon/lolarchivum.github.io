However, players do need to have a bit of stable ground to stand on.  And in my opinion, that stable ground should be the champs we play.\n\nBalance changes are fine, and 100% necessary.  Tweaking damage ratios and cooldown timers is one thing.  But chopping and changing abilities whenever the whim takes you is not a healthy way to balance champions.  Because as the majority of reworks have revealed to us; further down the track they often get changed back anyway (sometimes to an in-between that leaves a champ's kit lacking meaning, like Kog'Maw).\n\nIf players put in the effort to learn a champ, (and choose that champ to learn because they like how they play), its not fair to chop and change them all the time.\n\nIn my humble opinion, reworks should be considered only as a very last option, when all else has failed.\nChamps like old Sion and old Poppy did not age well.  Even with a complete visual overhaul, it would have been difficult to fit them into the modern scene.  In this kind of situation a rework is a viable option.\n\nReworking a champ just because it fits the current meta, or because they are 'a little boring', just doesn't feel like a good reason to me.\nYou tell us it takes about 3 years to bring a champ from concept to release.  If you can't make a champ balanced or interesting in that time.. sorry thats on you, you made your bed now you have to sleep in it.  If you couldn't make a good one in that time, the chances of quickly whipping up a good re-work solution in a couple of months are slim. (proven time and time again)\n\nAnd when you do bite the bullet and rework a champ.  That rework should be FINAL.  \nNo going back on it a year later and being like _\"Oh yea sorry, we changed your champ, and gave you just enough time to get used to them again, buuuuut we don't like it any more sooooo here's something that isn't the old champ, but isn't the new champ either... have fun!\"_\n\nTake Aatrox for example, he was reworked, then reworked again.  Then his rework was altered to play completely differently, and now in the last few patches changes have just been thrown wily nilly at him.  Im an Aatrox player, and recently I'm too scared to pick him, because I have no idea if i'm playing the same champ I played several months ago.\n\nIf its not too much to ask, could we please have a little more consideration when it comes to chopping and changing champs?\n\n\n___________________________________\n\nAlso on a personal note, I take issue with the whole \"Choose your next rework!\" thing. \nIf a champ is deemed broken enough to require a rework for balance reasons.  You rework them.  Don't make it a game show.\n\nIf there's multiple champs to be reworked, you rework them all.  If you don't have the manpower to do them all at once, pick the one causing the most problems in the game, and start with them, then work your way down to the least problematic.\n\nFiddle and Volibear 'won' _(if you can call it winning?)_\nDoes that make Mundo or Shyv any less in need of a rework?\nYou would have just as easily reworked them instead had the votes swayed in that direction.  Which means now there are champs in the game in need of a rework that wont get one _(at least not for a long time)_ just because they got voted off the island.\n\nIm a fiddle player, I know he's awful to play against, and probably does need some form of overhaul to give him meaningful counterplay.  But I do very much enjoy playing him.  I'm not looking forward to saying goodbye, but I am looking forward to playing the new one.  But I don't want his rework to be like Aatrox where they change meaningful elements of his play all the time just because someone somewhere isn't happy.\n\nMaking a skin like Resistance Illaoi or Demon Trist is one thing, but thats just a skin, if people don't like it, they don't have to buy it.\n\n**But putting champions up on the wheel of fortune is completely different. **\n\nWe all have to deal with that daily, and unlike a skin, we cant just go back and play the old version.  The community knows what it wants, but it doesn't always know what's best, putting actual balance changes in our hands is reckless.\n\nSomeone who follows the live and PBE patch notes rigorously, communes regularly with Riot devs, follows all the play-styles of bronze to challenger, and knows by heart the stats of the champs.  Their vote is worth the same as someone who chose Mundo for a rework cos they just don't like that shade of purple.\n\nYes its fair, and being fair is important its true, but is it best way of deciding balance changes for the game... well...\n\nWhat is everyone else's thoughts on this?","replies":[]}
