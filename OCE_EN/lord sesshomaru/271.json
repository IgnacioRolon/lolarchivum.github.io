Place a ward.\n\nThe problem is, with the current meta being what it is, many champs have the ability to engage on and kill _(or very severely maim you) _ even from the max distance it takes to place a ward in the bush.\n\nSo unless you already know there are no enemies around, you can&#039;t really place wards safely. Which kind of defeats one of the main purposes of placing a ward in the first place.\n\nThe range used to be fine when the meta was different, when you&#039;d ward and see someone you&#039;d think _&quot;oh, theres someone there.&quot;_ take a skillshot to the face or something and walk away with 3/4 hp still. But now, you go to place a ward and you just get jumped on and mauled in under a second.\n\nWhat&#039;s the difference between face-checking and warding now? More often than not, if there is someone there, you&#039;re gunna die either way.\n\nLike why not just give them a bigger range, what is the worst thing that could possibly happen? You cant really throw the balance of the game any more out of whack.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-01-12T00:19:12.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"No you can't have increased ward range, in fact Riot have decided to remove wards altogether\n\nTY Rito, how many more times can you fuck up this game","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-12T01:58:47.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They aren't removing wards.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-01-12T07:38:35.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"be honest, with the removal of sightstone that is a huge 'remember to ward' reminder (800g and an item slot, very visible), warding rates in low elo are going to hit all time lows.

The support is still going to have the wards. If they're forgetting to use it just say hey could you chuck a ward on x please? It'll more than likely remind them to ward their lane as well, and if things go as you say then you'll have a huge advantage over the enemy team.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-01-13T11:52:41.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I miss the days where a good support wouldn't buy a 6th item, and would just get like 50 wards and there wouldn't be a single spot on the map you couldn't see. xD","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-11T22:44:47.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Rito would have to acknowledge that the whole new rune system is a joke to fix that issue, so yeah, it ain't gonna happen.\n\nIs this where I say #bringbackseason2?","replies":[{"poster":"Driggz","date":"2018-01-12T02:09:07.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pretty much.

Thats just the way it is, it feels bad. and Riot are so afraid of people feeling that, that instead of nerfing the strong champs, they just buff everyone else. which means everyones damage just keeps going up and up.\n\nThe new runes didn't create the problem, but they sure as hell feed the fire.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-12T00:51:58.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean a lot of the problems stem from very few Runes in this system though.\n\nManaflow Band: if your a mana user, you basically have to take this, or you just lose because your opposing mana user took it, and you run out of mana well before them.\n\nUltimate Hat: Because manaless Assassin's really needed a 55% CDR ult.\n\nAftershock: oh you thought you were meant to kill the tank without a pen item?
