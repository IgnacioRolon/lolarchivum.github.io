No one misses out if they truly want it.\n\nHowever, when the limited skin is only available through a function of the game that relies almost 100% on luck.\nThen we have a different issue!\n\nPax Sivir is a skin that many people have wanted for a loooooooong time and been unable to get, because unless you happened to live in cities _(not to mention countries)_ where Pax was held, you missed out on this 1-time only skin.\n\nNeo Pax Sivir _(essentially a Chroma Pack for Pax Sivir)_ will be available for a limited time only from September to January _(4 months)_.\nHowever you can only obtain it through the Hextech crafting system, the same as Hextech Annie by crafting 10 gemstones together.\nThe problem being, is that there is no way to earn gemstones, they are obtained purely out of luck. \n\nSo even if you really want the skin, you still might not be able to obtain it before it slips away into the void.\n\n_______\n\n#Hextech Crafting  \n\nTo put this into perspective:\nI have made it a point to collect every single hextech chest obtainable by getting S&#039;s in game. You can store up to 4 chests, and I have never reached that capacity. I have also completed every mission with the reward of a chest. So in theory, I have received every chest physically available to earn, since the day of their release.\n\nI have purchased both Chaos and Order passes and earned the gemstones through them, as well as purchasing several bundles _(when they were available)_ that contained gemstones.\n\n**I currently have 5 gemstones.**\n\nIt&#039;s taken what? a year? more? since they were introduced, to gain that many.\nI now have to **double** how many I have in the next 4 months _(much less than half the time it took me to get what I have)_, just to get this Sivir skin I&#039;ve always wanted but couldn&#039;t get because I live in a different part of the world than Pax.\n\nNow I&#039;m no Lawyer, but that hardly seems reasonable.\nAnd I&#039;m sure there are many people In similar situations to me.\nI have 5 gemstones, my friend has earned 3x that amount in the same time, and I&#039;ve gotten way more chests than him.\nGetting limited skins through luck, just isn&#039;t the way to go!\n\n_________\n\n#Limited availability \n\nIntroducing a limited time only crafting skin has other implications as well.\nOnce you do it once, it&#039;s just a small step to do it again and again.\n\nSo at any time, Riot could make an announcement similar to today, introducing a new limited crafting skin. But what if you just bought Hextech Annie? or Soulstealer Vayne? Now you can&#039;t get the new skin because getting 10 gemstones in a couple of months is a feat nearly impossible.\n\nWhich means that even when you reach 10 gemstones, you can't buy the skin you&#039;ve been saving up for, because you need to have 10 handy just incase they release a new limited crafting skin for your favourite champ.\n\nFor example I have wanted Hextech Annie since its release, but now ill never own it because what if they release a limited Azir skin? I can&#039;t not have it... \nso I cant afford to waste 10 gemstones on Annie when the next day they could announce an Azir, Sol or Taliyah one.\n\nDo you see the implications a limited time only crafting skin has?\n\nWhat does everyone think of this?\n\n\n_PS. Of course you can get Neo Pax sivir by spending $400+ on chests from the store to farm gemstones, but funnily enough Riot stopped all Pax Sivir codes in circulation on eBay and such, because people were paying $200+ for them and Riot thought that spending this much was taking advantage of players.... _","replies":[]}
