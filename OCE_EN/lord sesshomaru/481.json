Props to the designers.\r\n\r\nBut I feel like its awesomeness is overshadowed by its ultimate.\r\nThe ult is a cool particle its true, and theres nothing wrong with it, except for the fact that no one wanted it.\r\n\r\nFrom day 1, the top 3 highest voted comments on _literally_ every medium where the skin was featured was &quot;please change the ult!&quot;\r\n\r\nNo change.\r\n\r\nLike really? What is the point even putting skins out on PBE for community testing, if when you get **overwhelming** feedback about it, you do nothing?\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]}
