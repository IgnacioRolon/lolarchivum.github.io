When a turret is slain (or maybe just first blood turret) it shows a picture of a random champion (usually one from the team who&#039;s tower got destroyed), not the champion that actually destroyed the turret, This is actually a 6.15 bug, but doesn&#039;t appear to be fixed.\r\n\r\n2. Remake Yes/No option does not appear on screen, even though in the chat you are notified that it has activated, (and as such you can not remake)\r\n\r\n3. you can no longer select a ward skin in champion select.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-08-11T05:35:37.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good spotting!

Rito please notice Lord Sesshomaru.","replies":[]}]}
