Blitz pulls him during the animation of arcane shift. Ezreal shifts to his new location, but by then, the actual CC effect has timed out (its a pull, so it happens instantly on contact, and doesn't have a duration). So Ezreal isn't pulled back.\n\nIm not sure I agree with how it works, but thats the way it does work.\n\nThe only exceptions _(to my knowledge)_ are Kalista's jump, and Yasuo's dash. _(Kalista's jump can even be slowed)_\nPossibly Aurelion Sol's comet of legend as well. But that is cancelled on damage anyway, so its more likely that i'ts the damage causing it to stop rather than the CC effect.","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-04-06T05:42:45.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with all that and I know it's intended.

Technically tristana dash can also be used despite blitz hook even though it's a dash though for some reason and so it breaks the dashes/blink rule and there is a small frame where tristana jump can be used to 'negate' the hook.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-06T14:28:35.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was so ready to say this but you beat me to it. Abilities like Ez's are basically a channel then an instant action, so as long as the channel/windup finishes the ability will go off, it's just for most champs the gap between channel completion and actual activation is a lot shorter, so for the most part they'd be interrupted or would not get hit at all.\n\nWhereas abilities like Trist's are essentially one long channel that can be interrupted like any other (if you can manage to hit her with how wonky placement gets at such camera angles). Trist though seems to have a short windup, then a small gap/window of opportunity then the actual dash channel, but she's the exception there.","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-04-06T22:37:02.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I fully understand why it works like that for blinks.

Even clunkier? I'm fine with cutting her damage if they make her fool smooth to play. Nerfing her by making her feel like trash to play isn't the way to do it. Her kit as is, needs to be ridiculous to be relevant. There is a slight delay on her E (Say this isn't irrelevant, I've been hit by Yas tornadoes, then shunpoing to him and getting ulted. I've been on the other side of a lane while Warwick Ults me on the other side. It's ridiculous), the 1.25 dagger delay, the Q delay. All of it adds up for a high skill champ, that doesn't feel smooth to play. Picking up daggers doesn't entirely reset the E at low levels, leaving about a .5-1 second cooldown on it, which feels terrible too. I agree, her numbers are pretty high, but I disagree, that making her feel utterly terrible to play is the way to nerf her.

It's such a shame that none of the other champs have to put up with such an inconvenience. Most of them have the pleasure of 14+ second dashes, that only go half the distance and don't do damage.\n\nIts almost like other champs can't blink constantly around a fight, making it impossible for skillshot champs, dealing mega damage with every jump.\n\nPlay Kalista and then talk about delays on jumping.\nPlay Azir and talk about a high skillchap champ that doesn't feel smooth as silk.\nPlay Aurelion Sol, and then.... complain.. at all. \n\nUnlike so many champions, Kat is at the mercy of very very very few.\n\nall champions deal with being CCed mid dash. On every champ except Kalista and Yasuo if you are CCed during the windup or animation of your dash the CC hits the champ, the champ completes the dash, and the CC continues to affect your champ after they land.\nIm sorry to hear that in the 0.01 seconds that Kat has an animation for her instant blink, you got caught by a tornado. But the rest of us have to deal with that on a far more regular basis. \n\nIf you think Kat is clunky, try playing some other less popular champions, you'll come back to Kat with a whole new outlook on life. \n\nSo what would your solution be to her catching daggers mid stun?\nIt makes no sense that you can jump up, catch a falling knife, and spin around on the spot, while concust.\n\nYou say that her being unable to do damage while stunned would be \"utterly terrible\".

If Katarina isn't jumping to the dictated dagger spots, she is losing huge amounts of damage and isn't getting the low cooldown Shunpo. If she is jumping to the daggers and people are standing around them, she setup right, and the enemy didn't react right. Hell, she has to jump INTO the enemy to hurt them (If she jumps back out, she's back onto the long CD, if she left her W there, she is missing out on alot of damage, if she W's in the middle of the enemy team, all she can do is hope no one notices her for 1.25 seconds and that they stay still). \n\nWith this patches nerfs, her E at level 1 has a 4 second cooldown with a dagger pick, 14 without. For a champion who has to wait for delayed daggers to reach a spot, that's a massive gap.\n\nKalista was nerfed to the ground because she dominated pro play. Azir kinda the same, but I'm not really aware of any \"smooth\" issues on him. Aurelion well uhhh... Can't say anything there.\n\nA champion doesn't have certain counters that absolutely ruin them? That'd be nice. These other champions you mention have other things in their kit other than damage. Yasuo has his defensive shield and windwall that blocks every single projectile in the game. Kalista well... Riot gutted her so, if she wasn't so gutted I'd say something here. \n\nIt's a blink tho. And it feels dirty. \n\nI mained Zilean mid, have M7 on him, he feels more smooth than Katarina. I'll give it to you, Aatrox is absolute trash and very clunky to play. That's bad design on his part. Urgot well... They are reworking him. And then I'd argue the only real clunky part of his kit is the ult. \n\nMy solution to catching daggers mid stun? Is it even an issue? If she's stunned you had time to walk away from the dagger.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-05T23:12:22.628+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't overestimate what she can do, i've had to experience it first hand many times.\n\nThe strongest thing about Kat, isn't her ridiculous damage, its the fact that you cant catch her. She can shunpo to any of 4 locations (2 daggers, you, or an ally minion/champion)\n\nPredicting that is difficult, but whats harder is predicting the exact moment of her shunpo, and timing your CC to hit her. If you wait for her shunpo to land, the time it takes for you to launch your CC is enough tine for her to shunpo again.\nYou're also forgetting that she can Shunpo twice in battle with no consequences (what other champs get a damaging dash that can be used so often in battle.) and THEN after doing that she can still shunpo to safety if things get rough for her.\n\nYes its true that she can only do damage around her daggers, BUT the Q dagger is extremely heatseeking, even when she throws it on a minion, it still tracks exactly to where your champion will be when it lands. Plus the radius on the spin is so large theres very little chance to avoid it. \n\nShe has the highest ban-rate in league, so its obviously not just me that finds her an issue to deal with.\n\nAzir doesn't feel as smooth as you think, when you place a soldier you have to wait for the whole cast-animation to finish before you can even start the windup animation for an AA. When you use Q, the soldier needs to come to a complete halt and play the stopping animation before you can start winding up your AA again. If you have 2 soldiers active on the field, and you use Q, your soldiers track to each side of the aim point, so when you want to hit something at max range with your Q, you need 1 or 3 soldiers, if you have 2, tough luck.\nWhen you want to dash, you cant just press your 'shunpo' button, you need to place a soldier, E in the direction of it, and in that millisecond before you hit the soldier you have to use Q to aim the dash to where you want to go. Thats 3 buttons and ALL of your regular abilities, and end up in your final location with everything on cooldown, just to dash any reasonable distance. (and that shit doesn't reset).\n\nIm not saying all of that should be changed, if he could AA and dash instantly, he would be way too strong. Just like if Kat could Shinpo again instantly after landing on a dagger, she would be even stronger than she already is. Remember when LB could just doubletap her W and jump on you and back again instantly. Kat would just be able to do that. And riot removed that because there was 0 counterplay.\n\nIf you stunned her, you do have time to walk away from the dagger (although thats assuming you stunned her at the exact moment she threw it, and not while it was halfway down.) But when youve stunned a champion, thats your time to strike. No other champions have a free 'don't come near me when I'm stunned or you'll die' safeguard. and neither should Kat.","replies":[{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2017-04-26T07:41:32.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"henlo very late reply but anyway:\n\nBy the time you reach a teamfight your e is on about a .3 cd with resets, but I'd argue that's pretty much essential to her kit. She'd be terrible if she couldn't dash in and out. Also err, if you've stunned her, walk in after she has spun and then go in really. As for the ban rate, I don't really think that's an issue. I honestly think that's more of a \"I've seen things ban\" as opposed to a \"good ban\". +her winrate has dropped to very close to 50% this patch.
