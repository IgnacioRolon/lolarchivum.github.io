You buy it to make the enemy AA champion think twice about attacking you.\n\nBut is it actually doing that? Is it actually punishing the enemy enough to make them hesitant to attack you?\nPersonally, I don&#039;t think so.\n\nThe only time you ever really buy thornmail is if there is an enemy who does the majority of their damage from auto attacks _(usually crits)_. \nBut virtually every champion that is worth you buying thornmail against, also naturally builds lots of lifesteal.\n\nSo all thornmail ends up doing, is nullifying some of their lifesteal.\nIt&#039;s not actually acting as a deterrent anymore, it&#039;s just more of an inconvenience to them.\n\n\nSo this is thornmail&#039;s effect:\nDeals 25% bonus armour + 15% of incoming damage from basic attacks, back to the attacker as magic damage.\n\nNow most AA champions have more than 15% lifesteal _(most ADC&#039;s have 20% just from 1 item alone)_. So already they are life-stealing back more health than is being dealt by thornmail.\n\nSo if we have an AA based champion: Lets say Caitlin, her Auto attacks do 800 damage. \nLeona has Thornmail.\nCaitlin has Bloodthirster.\n\nSo of 800 damage\n120 (15%) is being returned as magic damage.\n160 (20%) is being healed as lifesteal.\n\nSo Caitlin&#039;s health is going up by 40 per auto attack.\n\nSo now lets add in the bonus armour part of Thornmail&#039;s effect. \nLets say that Leona has 218 armour, _(2 armour items including Thornmail)_\n\n218 - 88 _(her base armour)_ = 130\n25% of 130 is 33\n\nSo thats 33 more damage that Thornmail is doing.\n\n40 - 33 = 7\n\nWhich means, overall, Caitlin _gains_ 7 health per auto.\n\nHer lifesteal completely nullifies the effect of Thornmail.\n\n______\n\nNow the clever cookies among us will be saying _&quot;Ahhh but Thornmail deflects the damage **before** reduction, Lifesteal gives you hp based on the damage **after** reduction.&quot;_\nAnd they&#039;d be right!\n\nBut the armour reduction calculation is far more complex than my feeble mind is willing to endure, so I&#039;ve left it simple for this post. \nWhich means that my above calculation is technically incorrect, but it demonstrates my point!\nand my rebuttal to all this, is that with 1 extra lifesteal item _(lets pretend, Bloodthirster and Botrk, not to mention runes/masteries,)_ the champion&#039;s lifesteal vastly outheals any damage done by Thornmail even with the proper armour reduction.\n\nSo in essence, all Thornmail becomes is just a Grevious Wounds item with 100 armour, that only affects lifesteal.\n\nIt in no way deters champions like Trynd/Cait/Draven/Yasuo/Vayne etc etc. from attacking. \nWhich are the main champions that you&#039;d buy it to defend against.\n\n_______\n\nI personally think that Thornmail needs a little buff, something that will make Vayne or Trynd think twice about 3 hitting your tanks.\nMaybe actually add some form of Grevious Wounds onto Thornmail&#039;s existing passive (with a slight reduction of damage of course). \nMake it like Sterak&#039;s, _&quot;After receiving X amount of damage from auto attacks from a single champion, applies Grevious wounds to the attacker for 0.5 seconds after each auto.&quot;_ Or something similar.\n\nWhat do you all think?\nIs Thornmail doing a good enough job of defending us from Vayne/Trynd/Yas/Draven/Cait etc etc?\n\n**[edit]:** Not to mention that a large portion of AA damage is now done though on hit and crit effects like Bloodrazor, Shiv, Botrk, etc. And I don't believe Thornmail offers any protection against that.","replies":[{"poster":"pedojuice","date":"2017-06-11T07:03:18.144+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"im so gald you are not on the rito balance team","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-06-11T09:00:05.442+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As am I! \nNumbers are not my forte.\n\nI just do my part to identify what I think could be a potential problem with the game, and propose a solution.\nAs just a humble player, thats the only power I have to affect the game I love.\n\nIf I just said nothing and went about my business, then it would show that I don't care about the game enough to see it improved. \nI say what I think is the best solution at the time.

I got you covered!\n\nIf we assume 218 armour as in your example, that would make the calculation for incoming damage after reduction the following:\n100/(100+218)\nGoing through the calculation as normal, that makes the damage reduction (approximately) 68.55% (or 67% if the Cait has Battering Blows mastery)\nApplying that damage reduction to the example, the Cait would be dealing 264 damage per auto (discounting Crits)\nThus, the Cait would be healing for (approximately) 53 health per auto, thus actually *losing* 100 health per auto\nAll of this assuming I've calculated it correctly.\n\nHmm... I expected something a bit different, to be honest...\nCan't say I've ever seen a thornmail work *that* effectively in-game, honestly. It always seems like the attacker is healing regardless of the thornmail.\n\nI don't know anymore...","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-06-11T07:06:27.443+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the calculations!\nMaths is certainly not my strong suit! xD\n\nHmmm it is weird that she is losing health.\nBut as you said, it does seem in game like the attacker is still healing.\n\nSo perhaps there must be some element we have failed to consider.\n_(Is lifesteal affected by on-hit or auto-enhancing effects?, I actually don't know.)\n_\n\nBecause I guarantee that Thornmail has not been working as you expect it would _(and certainly not as a deterrent)_, in the majority of games where I have seen it used _(or used it/had it used on myself)_.\n\nIn any case, it certainly isn't enough to deter anyone from attacking the wearer of the thornmail.\nSo I guess the ultimate question remains, is it doing it's job properly?","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-06-11T08:52:52.969+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But besides the point, riot is still working on thornmail, but grievous wounds was feeling too strong of a change, so atm they are looking at making it a self heal nerf, meaning adcs will struggle with lifesteal and heal, but supports like soraka will still be able to heal away without getting fucked over.\n\n(1-100/318=68.55, 68.55*.93=~63.7515) Also with battering blows it is ~63.75%\n\nCait does 800 damage an attack, so she will take (218*.25 + 800*.15 =  54.5 + 120)  174.5 damage.\n\nwithout battering blows she will do ((1-.6855)*800) 251.6 damage an attack to a leona with 218 armor. With 20% lifesteal she will heal 50.32, so she is actually taking an effective 124.18 damage, which is quite a bit................... though the interaction with thornmail is she will take 174.5 damage, then heal for 50.32 health, meaning she will die if she attacks below 175 hp, though she also wont heal if she is at 100% hp (rito spaghetti code, who knows, heal first then thornmail damage after that).\nMeaning she is actually taking an effective 124.18 damage a hit. But you know how it is, magic resistances and shit. (1-100/138.5=~28%)She will take 28% less magic damage, meaning she will  take 48.86 reduced damage on thornmail. Meaning she takes 125.64 damage and heals for 50.32, which is an effective 75.32 damage from thornmail. So yea, not quite as strong as heartvine made it out to be. But it ends up at 75.32 damage taken from thornmail without any armor penetration.\n\nThough with battering blows the final ends up as 67.64, which is quite a large decrease for only 7% armor pen, which is approximately a 11.35% difference (1.1135*67.64=75.31714).\n\nAn armor pen item will easily negate that even more, as well as a redpot making it completely redundant.\n\nBut lets be honest, high attackspeed champions suffer from thronmail much more than high damage champions.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-06-11T09:41:54.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ahhhh ok fair fair.\n\nAlso we haven't considered lifesteal off Runans as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-06-11T09:47:36.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"runaans was never part of the equation\n\nbut lets be honest, thornmail has the biggest effect against yasuo, because he usually stacks aa speed before anything else.
