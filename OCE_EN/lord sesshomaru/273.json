Now ill have even more of this useless crap...&quot;\r\n**Riot:** &#039;So you can buy Urfwick.&#039;\r\n**Sesshy:** &quot;WHY ARENT YOU GIVING ME MORE GLORIOUS BLUE ESSENCE YOU SCOUNDRELS!!!&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n__________________________\r\n\r\nBut I&#039;m a little torn about their decision to give players who brought runes before 2017, LESS of a refund, than players who bought them recently.\r\nI can see the logic, and it makes sense. Players who have had runes for longer have had more time to &#039;get their moneys worth&#039; as it were.\r\nIt&#039;s like buying a car, using it for 10 years and then expecting to sell it back to the manufacturer at full price. Thats not how the world works. You have had some use out of it already.\r\n\r\nBut on the other hand, it is stink to older players. There are a limited number of runes, and older players would have bought all the runes they needed _(maybe even all of them)_, ages ago and then had no need to buy anymore.\r\nWhere as newer players who haven&#039;t been as loyal to the game for so long, get more of a reward just for happening to start later.\r\n\r\nSo im not sure what I think about that.\r\n\r\n___________________________\r\n\r\nThe levelling changes look interesting though.\r\nHaving things to work on even once you&#039;re lvl 30 adds some interest for players, and I&#039;m all for interesting!\r\n\r\nMy one concern is that there seems to be a awful lot of &#039;good&#039; things happening in terms of &#039;free&#039; and &#039;cheaper&#039; stuff.\r\nMore frequent skins and champ shards, chests giving bonus drops etc. \r\nEverything in life is a compromise, so if we are getting better stuff now with nothing expected in return, theres bound to be some kind of catch later on, increased prices for skins or something like that. Idk.. just a hunch.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think of all the changes?","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-09-06T07:36:35.820+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just wanted to update the conversation with new info and contest \n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/o1hsbxt5-the-real-reason-veteran-players-are-unhappy-with-the-rune-rework?comment=001b\n\n\"I wanna jump in here to say that I think a lot of what OP is saying here is valid and true.\n\nRunes were never a good experience for players. They were basically a barrier between you and your ability to be really competitive in ranked, and the only way to overcome that barrier was by grinding. Not really \"pay-to-win\" but more like \"play-a-crapload-to-get-on-at-least-even-ground.\" Now that we're removing that barrier for all players, people who had to go through the gauntlet feel like they got a raw deal.\n\nSo, for that reason, we do think it makes sense for us to give a little back to folks who went through the gauntlet to get runes. That's why we're rolling out the rune rewards, and emotes for players based on how many hours they've played. I think we're open to the idea of doing a little more for veterans, but it'll have to be something like giving you something cool that lets you show off how long you've been in the game—giving away tons more BE just isn't that feasible.\n\nI want to be really transparent about our thinking behind the rune rewards, because there's definitely a lot of confusion around that. I think we've screwed up by repeatedly using language like \"investment\" around runes, because they were never meant as something you literally invest in in the hopes of getting a return on. And we're for sure not going to do a full refund on runes, because we don't think that replacing a system with a better system should trigger a refund on the old thing; That's not a precedent that we're going to set. Plus (and this is real talk mode cactopus), the fact is that us giving away IP has consequences. IP/BE is worth money for Riot—giving it away cuts into future champ sales. We can pretty closely estimate how many RP-based champ sales we'll lose over any given time period after giving away IP, and I want to make it clear here that selling champs is a huge part of the way Riot makes money so we can reinvest in the game.\n\nAlso, by merging the runes and masteries system into a new, free system, we're already investing in a major upgrade to the game. This costs money, but we think it's worth it for the future of League. So, the goal with the rewards we've announced is to recognize the time you’ve spent getting Runes and reward you fairly for it, without going overboard. That's why we're doing what we're doing.\n\nOne more thing that I've gotta call out is this idea that you're only getting back 12% of what you spent on runes if you bought them before 2017. That's just not true—the actual number (depending on which ones you bought) is a lot likelier closer to double that. I showed how to calculate your rune rewards in this reddit comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6xga15/riot_pls_leveling_ip_and_rewards_nexus_league_of/?utm_term=29654808102&utm_medium=comment_embed&utm_source=embed&utm_name=8c9fcecc-9253-11e7-9e9c-0e8523d0a180&utm_content=footer\n\nI hope that makes sense.

I can understand why in isolation the exchange rate between old runes --> BE might seem a bit low but I think if we look at the wider picture (this comes as part of a restructuring of runes, leveling, rewards) it makes a bit more sense.\n\n1) The only reason this is a thing is because we are revamping and improving the rune system. \n\nThe current runes system isn't really delivering on what a good pregame system should (most people just get their stat page off of pros as thats most optimal. There aren't really meaningful choices to make, and hopefully updating and improving the system and help move us in the right direction. Not only that we are actually making all runes free which IMO has been long overdue (but its difficult to overhaul something that affects so much of our game).\n\nThis means that if you didn't have all the runes you wanted, you get access to it all for free and can use BE on unlocking champions. IF you did have all the runes you wanted getting a better system is a win for all players.\n\n2) By creating this new leveling and loot system (more chests for everyone) + making runes completely free, we're already investing in a major update to the game. All of these changes are going to cost us money, but we think its worth it for the future of League. So, the goal with the rewards we've announced is to recognize players' investment into Runes and reward you fairly for it, without going overboard and hurting ourselves financially more than we really have to in the process. I know talking about money/costs is always a bit weird as usually we just talk about the game but these are very real factors we need to consider.\n\nWe feel like these new systems will help us address important problems \n\n\"Sometime last year, we started to look into big, long-lasting problems players have with some of the oldest and most fundamental systems in League—specifically IP, rewards, and leveling. A few things quickly became clear:\n\nSpending IP on runes doesn’t feel good and comes at the expense of unlocking champs\n\nGrinding to unlock champions takes too long, especially for newer players\n\nLots of players have huge IP balances with nothing to spend it on\n\nThe leveling system hasn’t aged well and offers nothing to longtime players\"\n\nHopefully this adds to the discussion and I'm really keen to hear more about your thoughts about our preseason changes!","replies":[{"poster":"CaerbannogBunny","date":"2017-09-05T08:08:23.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And what about all the people who HAVE all the runes they want AND bought the shit ones because there was nothing else to get with IP?

And the new runes will make up for the stat losses, but everyone is in the same boat there.\n\nbut personally I think urfwick should come down in price a little, as realistically very few people will be able to obtain it. \nI've been playing pretty much 2-6 games most days since season 2, and even with the runes refund I still wont quite have enough blue essence for it. _(Although buying Rakan and Xayah for half my friends list probably didn't help.....)_\n\nAnd I cant even begin to say how much sense it makes to change IP into blue essence.\nAs they were basically the same thing anyway.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2017-09-02T08:26:37.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just want this new rune thing so i dont have to grind to get runes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-09-02T08:01:09.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My main issue is... wasn't urfwick a charity skin back in the day?\n\nHonestly i tried to look it up, but good bloody luck now, but doesn't that kinda undermine the point of having BOUGHT the skin to help charity?\n\nIt'd be like Cosmic Reaver Kassadin being Resold for IP.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-09-02T09:13:33.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just because a skin was sold to help people a long time ago, doesn't mean people shouldn't be able to enjoy it now.\nThe enjoyment of the skin doesn't remove the positive effects it caused in the past.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Doc Savage","date":"2017-09-02T05:52:20.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what about real money purchases towards rune pages?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-09-02T04:35:49.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nah its bonus essence on the end for a bonus towards that urfwick","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-09-02T02:21:47.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's a good direction.

So because I've played for a long time, but not as often as other people, I'm not gonna get that much further in the champ department.\n\nPeople like me aside, I'd rather have more blue essence than I know what to do with, than have not enough and know that if you'd just never spent it on all those runes that you've only used once or twice in the first place you'd be better off for it.\n\nBut conversion aside, I like the direction, tying together those systems and making blue essence strictly for champion based progression feels a lot nicer and a lot less gated.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-09-02T00:08:59.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Luckily on my other account all the runes I bought were in 2017, so I'm not complaining","replies":[]},{"poster":"CaerbannogBunny","date":"2017-09-05T08:04:26.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Alot of people like me and my friends bought all the runes for the hell of it cause we had a shit ton of IP sitting there no we did not use the runes lets face it alot of them suck... and now because of that we get 1/4 the IP spent back..... were as people who saved the IP instead of buying the only thing available get 1/1 conversion...
