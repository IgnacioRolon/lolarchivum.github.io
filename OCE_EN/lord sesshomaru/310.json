Just doing the maths shows that you have disadvantaged far more champions than you are helping. (over 12 times more infact) AND not even all of those only AD scaling champions will even build tri-force/iceborn, infact only 3 maybe 4 of them would &#039;maybe&#039; build tri-force and i cant see any of them with ice-born as a regular item.. so thats maximum 4 champions in total that you have aided with this change.\r\n\r\nAlso ice-born tends to be used on tanks mostly, find me one &#039;true&#039; tank that doesn&#039;t have an AP scaling..\r\n\r\nSo all other champs \r\nShen, Kha&#039;zix, GP, etc. etc. now have to suffer so that 4 champs (only one of which actually really uses sheen) don&#039;t have to feel bad about a wasted stat.\r\n\r\ncan we please bring AP back into tri-force/iceborn/sheen?","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-11-13T10:30:22.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your post is a logical fallacy. \n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-11-12T23:01:02.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"90% of camps have 59+ base ad now add that with {{item:3078}} {{item:3053}} and some champs get 300 + damage from it","replies":[]}]}
