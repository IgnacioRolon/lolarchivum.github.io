I'm an accordingly adaptive and annoying to my enemies kind of dude. \n\nExcept Summoners Rift vs ARAM is like Mayweather vs Pacman xD 1's boxing that almost turns into a game of tag and the other one's straight up toe to toe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLSw21r7YyM I just like ARAM more because it really shows who trades well. I try not to play Summoners Rift much because I can't see everybody playing at once much :/ So I can't tip them in time as fast before they feed and sometimes some people keep soloing trying to backdoor just because they're fed and risk our nexus dying because were undermanned, instead of just grouping up with the team and ending in like 17 minutes -.- I like farming SR for chests though ^ ^ Mayweathers to Pacmanseses lol http://rs1099.pbsrc.com/albums/g381/Google-Images/Internet%20Memes/Me-Gusta-Face-Meme.png~c200 \n\nYeah, we both like new stuff.
