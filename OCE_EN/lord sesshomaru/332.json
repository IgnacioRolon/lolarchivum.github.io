(its been a while Yasuo)","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"#Gold income streams\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s been a while since i&#039;ve had a solid dig at Yasuo.\r\nBut I&#039;m actually changing my stance on the matter a little here. So don&#039;t change channel just yet.\r\n\r\nThis is unprovoked, _(I haven&#039;t vsed a Yasuo in a while)_ Ive been thinking for a while now that maybe the problem many people have with Yasuo isn&#039;t actually his crit chance or windwall or free shield at all.  Maybe he does deserve that strength. But he just has access to it too safely.\r\n\r\nLeague is all about compromise and trade offs.\r\nMages deal huge chunks of damage, but are restricted to being ability only champs, and deal with lengthy cool downs and high mana costs.\r\nADC&#039;s have crazy damage output, but have to be babysitted most of the game to get there.\r\nTanks are great at absorbing burst damage, but less effective against sustained output.\r\nSupports have all kinds of crazy tools, but lack the damage to follow up on them without assistance.\r\n\r\nSo too is gold income affected by the compromises and trade offs of your classes and champions.\r\n\r\nADCs for example, lack early game damage, so expecting them to get their gold income from early kills is a little unreasonable. Instead, they are given unparalleled last-hitting capability. So as most people know, ADCs get the majority of their money from farming not from kills.  Champs like Corki and Kai&#039;sa don&#039;t just leap into the fray at lvl 3 and come out with free kills, they sit and play the farming game for 20+ minutes instead.\r\n\r\nInversely, Assassins&#039; kits are heavily kill focused, they can score early kill gold pretty much whenever it suits. But as a payoff, they shouldn&#039;t have the farming potential other champs do.  And surely enough assassins like Kassadin and LB have big trouble farming, especially early, yet they can eliminate anyone who strays too close, picking up that nice kill gold.\r\n\r\nMages and Fighters are in-between the two, neither mages or fighters have the last hitting potential of ADCs, nor the all-in kill security of assassins. However they are not too bad at either.  It&#039;s not impossible for mages to pick up early kills by themselves, but it&#039;s also not too hard for them to clear a wave of minions if needed. They aren&#039;t however, specialists at either.\r\n\r\n_______________________________\r\n\r\n#Maybe Yasuo himself isn&#039;t the problem.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, some champs didn&#039;t get the memo.\r\nOne in particular is our favourite wind-swordsman.\r\n\r\nYasuo claims kills with no less difficulty than other assassins. Yet his farming capability is unmatched.\r\n\r\nThe problem with champions having easy access to multiple revenue streams, is that it becomes so much harder for the opposition to keep them down.\r\n\r\nYasuo is a champion who should be all about skill, his kit is literally built around outplaying people.\r\nSo if you&#039;re a skilled Yasuo, you should be rewarded with relatively easy kill gold.\r\nHowever, ATM if the opponent outplays you, you just go off and afk farm for a while and come back a monster.\r\nWhich is hardly fair, if you&#039;re playing a champ who revolves around outplaying people, if you get outplayed yourself, you should be penalised for that.\r\n\r\nI honestly think that is one of the major balance issues with Yasuo.\r\nFor so long the argument has been &quot;Yasuo is broken he&#039;s too strong he does his job too well&quot;, vs &quot;No he&#039;s not, if you nerf him he won&#039;t be able to do his job at all.&quot;\r\n\r\nMaybe Yasuo&#039;s strength isn&#039;t actually the problem, maybe he doesn&#039;t need combat nerfs, maybe it&#039;s that he can too easily switch how he earns his gold when behind.\r\n\r\nAssassins are high-risk/high-reward.  If he fails to do his job (killing people), he should be punished, but he isn&#039;t because he farms so well.\r\n_(to put it in perspective, Yasuo has a higher CS per game average than Nasus.)_\r\nIn fact Yasuo has the 4th _(3rd technically)_ highest CS per game score of all champions _(the next closest assassin is Zed in 72nd place.)_\r\nSo let that sink in for a bit.\r\n\r\n_____________________________\r\n\r\n#High-risk/High-reward... well... _risks_..\r\n\r\nKassadin and LB are perfect examples of the high-risk/high-reward playstyle in action _(in my opinion)_.\r\nBoth of them can jump on you without much warning and remove a good chunk of your health _(sometimes the whole thing if they play their cards right)_.\r\nTheir tricky kits allow players to consistently outplay their opponents, and it&#039;s relatively easy for them to get ahead and dominate, however, if they fail to do their job, and get outplayed themselves.  Coming back from behind as them is painful to the point of screaming!\r\nWhich is fair enough.  Picking an assassin is a risk, the advantage of having a fed assassin is insane. So also should be the disadvantage of having an underfed assassin.\r\n\r\nWhy Yasuo can have the same outplay potential and similar damage output as LB/Kass, but also have godly sustained farming potential is beyond me.\r\n\r\nI think you&#039;d kill most of the negative attitudes around Yasuo if you just made it so that he has to do his job in order to do well.\r\nIf you HAD to get kills as Yasuo in order to be the monster we all know. That&#039;d be okay. The good Yasuo players would be rewarded and hailed as the gods they are, and the crappy ones would be deadweights on the team; the unfortunate side effect of picking any high-risk/high-reward champion and failing.\r\n\r\nWe have all had that brain fart of a person play Yasuo and be 0/9 at 20 minutes, then come back and get a quadra kill in a team fight, just because he went out and farmed for a bit.  Hardly fair to the Viktor who spent 20 minutes keeping the Yasuo down at all costs.\r\n\r\nADCs like Ezreal and Kalista etc cant switch up their gold income.\r\nKalista cant just think &quot;Ehhh I don&#039;t like farming, imma just jump on their Annie and get a kill.&quot;\r\nLikewise an assassin like LeBlanc cant just be like &quot;Kills are hard, imma just go clear the jungle.&quot;\r\n\r\nWithin reason, they are restricted to the inhibitions of their class.\r\n\r\nYasuo shouldn&#039;t have the choice, he should have to stick to the restrictions of his class too.\r\nYasuo is high-risk/high-reward, if you want the reward, you should have to jump though the right hoops, otherwise you deal with the risk half of the equation.\r\n\r\nSivir is the only ADC in the game to currently have a higher CS per game than Yasuo.\r\nNo assassin should consistently have more farm than almost every single ADC in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-11-26T02:32:58.640+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nerf Yasuo :^)\n\nActually i agree with you, i hate vsing Yasuo (and playing him) but you're definitely on the right track with why/how he's strong, although is there anything that can really be done, without turning him into the next Azir.\n\nIf they nerf his farming capabilities, then it will rely on outplays. Increasing his skill requirement (not that there's much to begin with) but if he does receive a farming nerf, he's gonna suck getting kills to since he Uses his Q for both. The only possible change they could make, is change his E from a dash, to a last hit mechanic something like Zed's passive, deal additional damage on hit when below X amount of health.\n\nIf they nerf his fighting capabilities, then it will rely on farm, which leads back to the point, he'll need a passive like Zed's. \n\nI see two minor solutions, and one major.\n\nFull kit remodel, making Yasuo a Solely bruiser top laner with the possibility of going tank - Changing him from an outplay/Assassin/Farming/Fighting/Bullshit champ, to a farming and extended fights champ.\n- Change passive from free shield/free crit, to free shield OR Crit. Something along the lines of shield, that generates not just from moving, but from dealing champion damage too. Alternatively, only giving him the Crit bonus, and removing flow altogether.\n- Keep the Q, but increase its CD a bit at earlier levels, keeping the 2 and tornado mechanic\n- Remove W, fuck this ability, as a mage player, this is the most painful ability in the game, swap it for a brief attack speed boost, that in turn reduces Q CD by auto's, this will make his kit require more attentiveness and combo focus, rather than just spamming Q then pressing R for a free win\n- Change E, remove the dash, but keep its passive, something along the lines of every auto generates a stack of Wind, which on the 4th Auto/Q against a target deals additional damage (or something like this)\n- keep the R, but increases its potency, it doesn't do much damage, but with a proper combo it can seriously dole out some bruising. Utilising the suggested E mechanic in conjunction with ult, like burn 4 stacks, and get 4 instantly after ulting, timing your Final E stack with your knock up\n\nThese changes will make Yasuo more balanced (IMO) and make him actually require a brain to play, atm if you can press Q twice and Press R, you can win games on yasuo (generally speaking)\n\nAs for the minor changes\n\nMake him farm Focused, changing only his dash (based on what i've written in the kit remodel) so that he gains stacks that he can either prioritise for a cannon, or a fight, not both, right now you can use 3rd Q to farm and fight simultaneously\n\nMake him fight focused, changing his passive to the one above, where it generates in combat, rather than just by walking around, Risk = Reward\n\nThese are my suggestions, i can't give numbers, because that's not something i understand, but definitely your point is 100% accurate, this champ is either busted or useless, no in between, what he needs is to be somewhere in the middle.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-11-26T03:47:52.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funnily enough, I ironically actually like the windwall. :P \n('like' being term relative to the rest of his kit of course)\n\nIm also a mage player, and (maybe because of that) I like the concept of:\n'Clear Action = Clear Consequence'.\nI.e. If you charge up Xerath's big ass laser beam, and chuck it at someone. It'll damage them. (Clear Action = Clear Consequence)\nBoth people see a big AF blue piece of magic slap Viktor's ass, theres a big bang, and you see some of Viktor's HP disappear.\nIt makes sense, everyone knows what just happened and why. Theres no random hidden or lingering effects. \n\nI like it.\n\nWhat I don't like, is when Jax jumps on your ass twirling his diddle-stick, and theres a bunch of spinning and some real fast slamming sound effects and your Health just disappears, then he jumps away you think you'll live, then some random burn kills you. Same with Irelia, suddenly she's dancing around you blades everywhere, particles and sound effects are whizzing around in every direction, and then you die. Theres no clear action, and no clear consequence. Irelia knows that if she jumps on you she will deal damage, but even she probably doesn't really know exactly when and where it all comes from. Not in the same way that a Xerath knows at least.\n\nYasuo's wind wall is Clear Action = Clear Consequence. He throws up a massive wall, it blocks shit.  It makes sense.\n\nI despise when Yi duels you, you see his attacks happen, and you know they are applying on hit effects, but you have no way of know what, but sometimes he autos twice both times applying on hit effects, sometimes he turns purple applying on hit effects twice as well, sometimes he turns purple when he attacks twice applying on hit effects god knows how many times. Sometimes it does true damage, sometimes it does bonus physical damage, sometimes it doesn't do either. Sometimes he's un-targetable for a long time, sometimes it's virtually instant in and out. All the while applying god knows what kinds of bleeds and %HP on hit damage and all other hidden effects that aren't directly visible.\nNot to mention all of this is hidden under the fire you are throwing at him, so even if you are focusing hard enough mid-teamfight, to see exactly what colour his sword is, or when he turns purple and when he doesn't. All of these effects are hidden by the big ass lasers and fireballs that you are throwing at him.\n\nI don't like that kind of style, and the rest of Yasuo's kit is very similar, he does a lot of things very quickly and its very hard to follow exactly what.\n\nIm not a huge fan of on-hit and hidden damage sources.\nI prefer the big fuck-off lasers :P\n\n___________________________\n\nThat is why I don't mind Yasuo's windwall, yea its a dick ability, but at least you know where you stand with it.\nIf I had to change the windwall, I would shorten the duration significantly,  and I would make the windwall spawn a set distance in front of him, not come out from his body.\n\nThis would make it so he would have to be be selective about when he uses it. If he sees Jinx launch his ult, he could whip it out and block it, no different to usual. So it doesn't damage his playmaking potential.\n\nWhat It would change would be the ability to just throw it up mid fight, and completely shut out everyone on that side of the battle for 4 seconds.\n\nThe change of having it spawn away from him rather than it coming out from his body also means that he has to actually predict or react quickly to abilities to block them.  Not just throw it up at the last second when he realises he's in trouble.  If he waits for an ability to literally be point blank next to him before reacting, then he shouldn't deserve to block it.\n\n__________________________\n\nIn terms of cutting his farming potential whilst maintaining his combat prowess.\nMaybe something along the lines of making his crit chance only effective against champions.\nThe tradeoff of having 100% crit on champs, is that he cant crit at all against minions.\n\nMaybe make his dash still increase the damage each time he uses it, but it can only damage champs and pets, not lane minions.\n\nThese changes wouldn't stop him from farming, he is still AD, and his Q is still basically a ranged AOE AA, but it'll stop him clearing the entire wave with a single EQ at least. _(omg Yasuo, imagine having to attack each individual minion like a normal person :O)_.\n\n\nAgreed, making his shield come back through combat and not just walking around, would make sense!","replies":[]}]}]}
