I suspect that HeartVine is right, but I would say it's unintended because it interrupts the expected turret aggro, it's unpredictability that really shouldn't be there so definitely worth the post.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-06-26T13:13:01.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok ill flip it over to the bug report section tomorrow. ^^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-06-25T23:44:26.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I knew I wasn't going crazy! They all said I was going crazy, but I knew they were wrong!\n\nI'm already crazy, after all...\n\nAnyway, I *think* I can explain this just a little bit. If I'm not mistaken, the towers didn't attack because of the invulnerability provided by Taric, then once that ended Lux was one attack from dying, and I've found turrets don't do anything if someone \"one-shots\" a low health enemy under their turret.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-06-26T00:28:42.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://static.srcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/Joker-Laugh-Killing-Joke.jpg\n\nxD\n\nI thought that as well, but I don't see why thy wouldn't attack if you are invulnerable.\nIm pretty sure they still attack Kayle _(untested though)_.\n\nI know it's definitely untargetablity they they don't attack, but Taric is still 'targetable' he's just invincible. cos he's so manly!\nI just have no idea xD","replies":[{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2017-06-26T06:17:15.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ay, the killing joke!\n\n\nYou may be wondering why I haven't been playing much LoL lately, well it's because I've been binging the Batman: Arkham games (save for Knight since i can't run it).\n\nIt's actually nice to take a break from LoL in favour for a single player game, you know","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-06-26T06:27:36.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea haha its a great comic!\nI have it in print somewhere actually. \n\nThats cool!
