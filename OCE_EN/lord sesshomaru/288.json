I just got clarification from one of the support guys, and you have nothing to worry about and can continue to play doom bots as normal. I know the language was pretty ambiguous which is why I wanted to confirm before I actually posted.\n\nTo clarify \"Players who abandon the game will forfeit their icon. Icon will appear in your account up to one week after defeating Doom Bot mode.\" DOES NOT mean \"Players who abandon any game throughout the Teemoing will forfeit their icon for the remainder of the event.\". Rather it means if you were afk/dced in the win that would have gotten you the icon you will not be eligible.\n\n**tl;dr The game you won without dcing has made you eligible for the icon and any dcs in future games throughout the event will not make you ineligible. You should get the icon sometime between the end of the event and two weeks after.**","replies":[]},{"poster":"About 9 Kenyans","date":"2016-10-22T06:52:34.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"icon?","replies":[]},{"poster":"BananaSlayerAMO","date":"2016-10-21T04:46:15.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it depends on how long you dc'd for. If you left the game for a long time and didn't come back (which is caused by more than just below average internet),  then Riot believes you deserve to lose your icon for ruining that game for your team and wasting their time. \n\nBut if you just dc'd for a while and didn't affect your team by much, then I agree that you don't deserve to lose your icon.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-10-21T04:51:58.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my internet is fine most of the time, then randomly without warning it cuts out and i need to re-start the whole thing (and sometimes it takes multiple goes) so if I'm mid game, you can kiss it goodbye.\n\nIt hardly ever does it, but it does happen, and theres nothing i can do about it. :/","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-10-21T04:46:41.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just have fun.
