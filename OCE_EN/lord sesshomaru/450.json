Sorry Kindred die-hards.)_\r\n\r\nThey are certainly stronger now, the buffs to their ability damage means they can clear much faster and defend themselves much easier early, _(it&#039;s a massive difference) _. And their damage later is greater than it used to be _(on average)_.\r\n\r\nBut at what cost?\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that they have lost their &#039;soul&#039;. The thing that made them &#039;Kindred&#039;. \r\nThe old Kindred was all about marks! You felt great when you get them, and stink when you didn&#039;t. You were instantly rewarded with a visible effect (% HP damage), evey time you got a mark, and each individual mark felt meaningful. She was strong with marks, and weak without _(like Nasus and his stacks, except without the tankiness and cc to fall back on.)_\r\n\r\nThe new Kindred still likes to have marks, but they feel kinda shit. They give some small passive buff to your abilities _(which you don&#039;t really notice)_, it&#039;s hard to tell wether your power is coming from your marks, or wether it&#039;s coming from your items and levelling up abilities.\r\nEach individual mark doesn&#039;t really matter in terms of &#039;fun&#039;, like I said, they are just indistinguishable passive buffs. The only ones you actually care about and look forward to are the 4th marks that increase your attack range, and even then, it&#039;s just a gimmick. You are in maximum 1 skirmish before you get your 4th mark, and by the end of the laning phase you have around 8 anyway, and then you&#039;re stuck on 600 range for most of the rest of the game, _(you maybe get 625 if you&#039;re good)_. Once your jungle marks stop spawning, getting 4 marks is a LOT, and for only 25 extra range.\r\n\r\nEven at 12 marks, she still cant match the range of Caitlin and Tristana. _(which feels kinda stink for a champ who&#039;s whole selling point is that she has scaling range.)_ She needs to be at 16 just to break even with Cait, and she needs **20 marks** before she overtakes Tristana. To put this in perspective for non-KIndred players: 17-18 marks by 50 minutes is doing fantastic! So you can imagine how often you get 20....\r\n\r\nSo you can imagine that it feels kinda shit.\r\n\r\n______\r\n{{champion:203}} \r\n\r\nThe next thing, is that she isn&#039;t even weak without marks now...\r\nIf you decide that theres no point racing Lee around his own jungle, and just want to farm up and buy items, it&#039;s not actually that punishing.\r\nA friend and I spent a whole game denying a Kindred her marks, _(legit she was still spawning jungle marks at 45 minutes! she had NOTHING all game)_. Could still 1v1 anyone on our team while behind. \r\n\r\nHer playstyle isn&#039;t unique anymore either. She has gone from a semi-fragile shadow who dances on the edge of battle, not getting too close, but never being to far away. To just the typical ADC _&#039;stand far away and crit them to death&#039;_. playstyle that we have all come to hate. \r\n\r\n\r\n________\r\n{{champion:203}} \r\n\r\nHer W changes are useful, it is more fun being able to direct Wolf, and it&#039;s wayyy better for chasing, and poke _(should she be able to poke?)_. Although I don&#039;t see why he needs to do magic damage, all that does is give her less counterplay?\r\n\r\nBut it&#039;s her E that feels truly off. \r\nIt now crits when the enemy is below a certain HP _(scaling with marks)_. With makes sense. So.... it&#039;s an execute? Right?\r\nBut, it&#039;s also her only CC, sooo... its an initiate?\r\n\r\nSo which is it? An execute.. or an initiate? it can&#039;t be both! \r\n\r\nIt feels weird, you never really know what to do with it. \r\nHitting it at exactly the right HP % is hard, especially seeming you have to throw it and then auto 3 times to even activate it, and the % is always scaling, so you never get the &#039;feel&#039; of knowing the right %, like you do with other champion&#039;s abilities.\r\nSo therefore your best bet is to use it for initiating, like old Kindred did, and use it for the CC... But then youre wasting a whole segment of your mark&#039;s power, so you feel bad for doing that.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s just a _wrong_ ability now, it&#039;s purposes are too conflicting, and using either just feels bad because you miss out on the much wanted stats of the other.\r\n\r\n__________\r\n{{champion:203}} \r\n\r\nShe feels completely different than she used to, she feels like _&#039;Vayne in the jungle&#039;_. as opposed to _&#039;the eternal **hunters**&#039;_.\r\nHer marks feel shit to go after, considering the danger Lee Sin and other junglers poses to her in the enemy jungle. Basically their only purpose is the bonus attack speed on her Q _(it&#039;s the only thing they buff that feels satisfying)._ and you only get something visibly exciting every 4 marks.\r\n\r\nShe is way stronger than she used to be, but really doesn&#039;t feel like herself.\r\nShe feels rushed and conflicted.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?\r\nAny Kindred players who want to add/dispute/agree with what I have said?\r\n\r\n______\r\n{{champion:203}} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**TL;DR:**\r\nShe is more powerful, but her marks feel less satisfying to get, and depriving her of them doesn&#039;t give as much counterplay as it should. Her E feels conflicted as it is both an execute as well as an initiate? She only barely matches Caitlin&#039;s range when she is doing well in a _long game_, and will only outrange Tristana after **20 marks**. Which feels shit for a champ whose whole selling point is _&#039;scaling range&#039;_.\r\nHer playstle now is just _&#039;stand far away and crit them to death&#039;_. and we already have tons of champs who do that _(but better)_. So not only does she feel less unique, but she doesn&#039;t really fit with her theme anymore of _&#039;the innocent but creepy as fuck grim reaper that&#039;s coming for you!&#039;_. and just feels like yet another highly mobile crit champion.","replies":[{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2017-06-05T04:11:27.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lord Sesshomaru: The Return of Wall of Text\n\nno wonder you main Azir and Taliyah, you all make walls","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-06-05T04:38:55.918+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least I didn't vote for Trump xD","replies":[{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2017-06-05T04:55:27.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But we're in OCE .-.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-06-04T23:02:38.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've never played kindred so I can't comment on whether her rework is good or not. But please please don't return her Marks to scaling % health damage. Maybe I'm biased because I play a lot of tanks but it was to much. There was nothing fun about getting shredded in two seconds flat despite all your tank items because of a ton of percentage health damage. Though admittedly it's been a while since that happened, mostly cause I don't see her but when I do she was just kinda there and not doing much. \n\nMaybe they could buff what the Marks give you without returning them to scaling percentage health damage? I'm not necessarily against a certain number of them giving her an amount of percentage health damage, as long as it doesn't keep scaling up. That would probably be easy to balance as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-06-05T03:19:34.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that % HP damage isn't the least cancerous stat out there....\nBut at least Kindred's % HP damage was reduced by armour, so it wasn't too much of a problem if you build armour instead of HP _(unlike a certain Vayne...)_\n\nI think her new marks are stronger than her old ones.\nBut they just feel less satisfying and unique.\n\nRather than have a clear extra per mark, that is easily measured and visually represented.\nThey are just passive buffs to her overall damage output, no different than items.\n\nI would rather they have a clear effect that can be measured and seen in game. \nIt doesn't have to be % HP damage. Maybe each mark turns 3% of her damage into true damage or something?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZedsDeãdBãby","date":"2017-06-04T21:51:38.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> So he would always have a friend..? \n\n..So he would always have a friend.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sh4dowscyhe","date":"2017-06-04T19:22:38.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I, for one, am in complete agreement with you. I always hated playing botlane but nothing else really fit. So when i played kindred it just worked really well. Sure, they weren't the strongest jungler, but they were **UNIQUE.**  they had a gameplay that was different from all of the other champions. You didn't just want hunts, you NEEDED them. I enjoyed the fact that kindred didn't need to build damage or crit to be effective, and I liked that it was offset by having hunts play such a meaningful role. Now they feel like a weak jungle tristana or something. I may have to find a new main, as Kindred's gameplay just feels bland now. it's not even fun.","replies":[]}]}
