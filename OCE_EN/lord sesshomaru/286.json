If they want to keep true to their word that is.\n\nYes it is possible that it wasn't ready for PBE, but then thats just all kinds of sloppy. \nWhat happens now? Do the skins stay on PBE for several more weeks waiting for the new skin (who then in turn has to sit in PBE for 2 weeks) which is a sure-fire way to kill hype and lose sales.  Or do they release the current skins and then add her skin later? What happens to people who bought the bundle in that scenario?  Do they miss out on a skin? Do they get an IOU? Do they just have to pay full price for this random extra skin a month later?  My guess is that if it wasn't ready for PBE, they would have delayed the whole skin line from PBE.  _(and if for some reason they didn't, i'd expect them to at least have the courtesy to Xayah players to make some kind of announcement that she is in fact getting a skin)._\n\nIf they don't make the skin, like you say then they will always have this 1 skin that will never match, and it will piss off all Xayah/Rakan mains for all time, and for the sake of a single skin, why would the dev team risk that? \n\n**_They knew the possibilities of Victorious and Team skins when they made their promises, they should have to sleep in the bed they made._**\n\nAbout having an extra skin.  Thats just the way things are I guess.\nIt sucks for people who bought Gentleman Cho'Gath when it came out, because for the same price today you can get a skin like Odyssey Kayn, which is just far far far better designed and has more bang for buck.  They arent going to refund players, or go back and re-vamp all skins that fall below the modern quality threshold.  _(they should.  Or at least reduce the current price, to reflect quality.)_ So why would we expect different fairness treatment for team skins?\n\nLikewise, It sucks for TPA because they have less skins, no ward, no borders, no particle effects, no voice filters, no recalls.  So if they wanna be fair, Riot has a choice, either re-vamp the TPA skins, or purposefully hold back on neat effects for new skins.\nAnd I think purposefully holding back neat content for new skins would be the greater of the two evils.\n\nThey did the best they could at the time for the old teams.  Now they are doing the best they can for the new teams.  Technology has moved on.  It's not fair that my dad didn't have a cellphone when he was a teen and I did.  But Apple doesn't owe my dad a phone because of it.\n\nIm always a fan of striving for the ideal, and in an ideal world they should go back and tweak old content to bring it up to modern standards. But unfortunately that isn't going to happen, and to miss out on new cool content just to keep things 'fair' to old content, is very much a step backwards imo.\n\nYes, there will be unfairness no matter what they do. \nBut they made that bed, and they should have to sleep in it.  \nIf they want to break their promise about Xayah/Rakan, thats fine, it's their game they can do what they want.   But they should have to at least acknowledge that they went back on their word, and that they have broken faith.\n\nThats my view anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-04-04T12:09:18.483+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Yes it is possible that it wasn't ready for PBE, but then thats just all kinds of sloppy.\n\nHow? Ultimately, that's what PBE is for. The sooner they get content up the more testing time they have with it. SHould they lose all that test data for the other skins, because one of them isn't ready for PBE yet? Some content stays on PBE longer than others, and not just when serious issues are found. That is just the nature of a test server.\n\n>a sure-fire way to kill hype and lose sales\n\nNot really. The majority of players don't follow PBE content, and those that are invested enough to follow PBE content, are invested enough to wait another couple of weeks.\n\n>Or do they release the current skins and then add her skin later?\n\nIf bundles are involved, I'm sure they'd wait for the bundle to be complete. Ultimately, it's only speculation at this point.\n\n>It sucks for people who bought Gentleman Cho'Gath when it came out...\n\nThis is a valid point, but the thing is it would be a current standard. It's not like it's outdated and they've since updated standards, it's \"this random year of winners in the middle gets an extra skin just because\".\n\n>And I think purposefully holding back neat content for new skins would be the greater of the two evils.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm with you. I think they should make an Invictus Xayah skin and be done with it, I'm just also saying that I understand why there's a bit more consideration to be had.\n\n>in an ideal world they should go back and tweak old content to bring it up to modern standards\n\nIt's not just practicality, some of it would actually be impossible. Take the signatures for example, theoretically, they could add those to the old skins, but they may not have any way of contacting some of those players anymore, many of them aren't in the esports scene anymore certainly. \n\nSame applies to things like VOs. Sure it'd be nice if older skins had interactions like new ones, but what if Riot no longer has access to those voice actors? Do you find someone who sounds close and limit them in what they can do for the champ/skin, or wait for the VU?\n\n\n>Yes, there will be unfairness no matter what they do.\n\nThis was pretty much my entire point. Like I said, personally I feel they should make the skin, there's just more to it for Riot to think about.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-04-04T15:07:24.200+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> How? Ultimately, that's what PBE is for. The sooner they get content up the more testing time they have with it.\n\nSkins don't even _really_ need to be up on PBE, some skins (like Odyssey if I remember correctly) just skip PBE entirely. Proving that it isn't essential to have skins on PBE.\n\nUnlike gameplay changes the teams know exactly how the skins should affect the game, so any major issues _should_ be pretty easy to find before it even enters PBE.  The main changes skins ever get on PBE is when the community demands something change.  _(which is clearly happening here, so if they don't do a Xayah skin, then putting invictus skins up in the first place was kinda pointless)_.\n\n> those that are invested enough to follow PBE content, are invested enough to wait another couple of weeks.\n\nIm not so sure, I remember when Warring Kingdoms Azir (and others from the rooster series) went up on PBE, and stayed there for like 2 months.  I was so hyped at first, I was like \"fuck yea its the year of my main man, imma grab all this shit.\"  nearly 2 months later I was like \"Fuck it gimme my Azir skin already! Fuck the others, fuck the icons, fuck everything else.\"\n\nSo having things up too long in advance does kill hype. (like how they announce \"The New Batman Solo Film!\" and everyone loses their minds.  2 years later and they haven't even finished filming... so yea... it kills hype.)\n\n> If bundles are involved, I'm sure they'd wait for the bundle to be complete.\n\nThat just screws over players who don't follow out-of-client info though.\nThey buy all the skins on day 1 for full price (not even realising there will be a bundle later), then the bundle comes out and they realise they lost $15.\n\n> this random year of winners in the middle gets an extra skin just because\n\nI mean, it's hardly random.  The team skins have been progressively gaining bonuses since they first came out.\nTPA got skins only.  SKT got skins and a ward.  and that just ballooned out into borders and signatures and particle effects and a 6th skin.\nWhy would another bonus be so out of place?\n\nAnd it's hardly 'just because' either.\nThey made a promise.  And we can all see why the promise was made, its stupid for those two not to have matching skins.\n\n> I understand why there's a bit more consideration to be had\n\nOh I agree. But you still have to make a decision in the end.  And it seems most people do not agree with the decision they (apparently) made.\n\n> It's not just practicality\n\nFor sure. Which is why I said in an ideal world.\nObviously they wont do it.  But holding back on future content because of that is not a train I can get on.\n\n> This was pretty much my entire point. Like I said, personally I feel they should make the skin, there's just more to it for Riot to think about.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I can see Riot's side, I always can. And its fair enough, if you keep making exceptions all the time, you end up with team skins coming out for everyone and every champ involved, and before you know it half the roster is in Invictus colours.\n\nBut all I'm saying is that they made a promise, and now they have broken it.  \nThey may have their reasons _(that they choose not to share with us)_, and they may or may not be good ones!  But they still broke faith and they should have to face up to that.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
