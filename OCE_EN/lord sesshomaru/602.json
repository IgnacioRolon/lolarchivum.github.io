Tell her you have bad news.\nIt started when you were a young child. In your first game of kickball you kicked the ball the wrong way. Repeatedly. They told you you had no skills. Desperate to find a hobby in which you excelled, you joined another team. A dodgeball team. The first time a ball hit you, a rage began to smolder. Your team had let it happen. It didn&rsquo;t matter that you didn&rsquo;t doge, what mattered was your team was bad.\nTeamwork was just talk. Sick by the notion that they could win, you were taken by a tempest of emotions, until a single thought shone through. They said you had no skills. But they were wrong. You had a very, very good one. You stood still, a mad grin spreading across your face, silently requesting, no, demanding, the enemy to hit you. And they did. The cries of your teammates were lost to the wind as they were defeated. And deserved it. Elated, you took your last breath as an ordinary person. You&rsquo;ve since joined the ranks of the most anathematized group known to existence, Yasuomains, whose glory is known across the globe.\nYou take your mother&rsquo;s hand in your own and tell you have found a place where one has no need of skill. You have found a home, one to which only another inting interested recruit has a key.\n&hellip; or just dodge the question until she rage quits.\n\n\n\nGood. Im glad we can all laugh and make jokes about these things. Thats good.\nBut have you forgotten, that in an Ask Riot, not dissimilar to this one in fact. You announced a potential Kindred level rework for Yasuo.\n\nhttps://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/06/ask-riot-yasuo-ge\n\nAnd that _**isn&#039;t**_ a laughing matter, as I for one have heard no hide nor hair of any such development since, neither for yay or nay. and several other champs have been reworked in the elapsed time, _(most notably, **BOTH** of the champions stated as being of equal importance as Yasuo&#039;s rework.)_\n\nNow if you have scrapped said Yasuo rework, like I somewhat begrudgingly expect, implied by the distinct radio silence. Is it not only fair that you inform us on a renege of such a promise?\n\nOr if in the inherently unlikely situation Thunderbirds are still go on this, perhaps it&#039;s time to bring us out of the dark, yes?\nA little transparency never hurt anyone, especially when the issue plagues us all. _(not least of all Yasuo mains who have their champ banned in a vast quantity of games)_.\n\nThe last we heard on the subject was that some thinking was to be done.\nWell, I&#039;m sure that by now, someone at Riot HQ is bound to have had an opinion on the matter.\nI for one, would like to hear it!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[]}
