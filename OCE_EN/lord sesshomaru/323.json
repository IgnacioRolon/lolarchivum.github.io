Of course you are within your right to do so, but I don't have to support it.\r\n\r\nIf you're not willing to live up to your promises, don't make them in the first place.  \r\nThe game is constantly under threat of change, _(no one knows when or how their favourite champ/skin will be hit with the rework stick)_, and so when you do make promises, it's a little piece of certainty people can cling to.  Taking that away, is a betrayal of trust.\r\n\r\nSo I respectfully decline to purchase the skin, due to the lack of a Xayah one.\r\nPersonally I have no attachment to Xayah in particular _(i'm more a Rakan guy anyway)_.  \r\nBut there are many who are attached to Xayah, and they are the ones whose trust you have betrayed.\r\n\r\nThis will be the first time I haven't bought the full bundle with all the team skins and all the borders/extras. \r\nSo now the collection is _(and forever will be)_ broken.  Which means I have no reason to buy the full bundle for future team skins either.\r\n\r\nIt's a shame, but thats how it is.\r\n\r\nYou must have had your reasons for making Xayah and Rakan forever unable to be perfectly matching.\r\nI don't know what they were, but clearly they were more important than the players.  And thats fine, I can't judge your decision based on factors I don't know.  But what I can see, I don't like, and won't support.\r\n\r\nMy money alone means nothing, and i'm aware of that.  And I'm not abstaining from supporting the game in general, I will still continue to buy other skins.  I do love the game after all.  This isn't a threat or anything else.  Just an expression of my disappointment.  This game used to be community focused, and it has long strayed from that path.\r\n\r\n_Sesshy_","replies":[{"poster":"Outis","date":"2019-04-29T08:17:53.099+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the real issue is the fact that they are charging an extra $10 for an icon. we have got to the point that an icon costs 2/3rds of the price of the skin it is connected to....","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-04-29T16:12:01.177+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, no argument there.\nThe RP pricing change also makes it even more expensive.\n\nThe original Team skins bundle could be bought for under $40.\nNow you need upwards of $130 to get the whole pack.\n\nAgreed the skins are better than back then.

So I fail to understand the relevance of this statement?\n\n> You should buy a skin because you like the skin. In this case, you buy the skin to support the team that won and the riot devs.\n\nYou buy what you want. But you also vote with your money.  \nIf you don't like animals being squeezed into cages for their entire life, then buy free range meat and eggs instead.  If you value the rainforest, don't buy palm oil products.  I value Riot's promises, so even though I want the skin, I'm not going to buy it.  (just like I like cheap meat, but if an extra $5 means the pig can have a half decent life, then thats a sacrifice i'm willing to make).\n\n> Just because Xayah and Rakan are a pair, doesn't mean they need matching skins every single time. \n\nActually.... it does.  \nRiot specifically said as much when the champs were released.\n\n> No one is telling you to buy the skin.\n\nNo one has to buy anything in league.\nYet we do. \n\n> Team skins are to celebrate the pro players performance for that champion. They're not to pander to your feelings.\n\nActually the team skins are very much about pandering to the player's feelings.  Pro play is something that many players feel strongly about, and if the players didn't care, then Riot would most definitely not be making team skins.  Think about the last batch of SKT skins, Riot make skins to congratulate the Pros, and the players felt so strongly about it, that Riot recalled them, changed a bunch of things, made a whole new skin, as well as removing one and replacing it with another that the community felt better about.  So how again do the skins not pander to our feelings?\n\n> The only one that cares about your skin collection is you.\n\nAnd I am sad.  No one asked you or anyone else to be sad as well.\nBut I'm well within my right to explain why.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2019-04-29T07:45:09.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Your first statement: \"The game is constantly under threat of change, (no one knows when or how their favourite champ/skin will be hit with the rework stick), \"\n\nYour second statement: I am aware of the concept of boycotting, but at the end of the day the only reason why you should buy a cosmetic item is if you like it.\n\nThird statement: That's like... your opinion.\n\nFourth statement: Glad we agree\n\nFith statement: No sorry, the team chooses the skins that reflect their player's performance. They're not empaths capable of feeling how much people like skin or not. At the end of the day, they do commemorate fond moments and performances of a players champion, and that's the reason they picked Kai'Sa over Xayah for Invictus. Its egotistical to think that we create those moments and performances by feeling strongly about it rather than the professional players hours of dedication to pulling it off. It is specifically because of the professional players performance that we feel strongly about them. So invictus chose skins for champions that they felt best fit their performance. So yes there exists a connection, but its not based on the fans, its based on the professional player. And in that way they're not pandering to your emotions, if they were you wouldn't be crying about a skin.\n\nFinal statement: And no one asked you to make yourself sad. Your happiness is your own responsibility. You're being stubborn about something that doesn't even matter. You'd be happier keeping your collection up to date than trying boycott them but hey, you win right? I'd say save the money anyway, but you do you boo.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-04-29T16:09:24.498+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Your first statement: \"The game is constantly under threat of change, (no one knows when or how their favourite champ/skin will be hit with the rework stick), \"\n\nAs you can see, I'm not talking about Nerfs/Buffs.\nIm talking about how at any time your champ could be removed from the game and replace with another champ that shares the same name, and has 1 or 2 _similar_ abilities:  \n{{champion:266}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:83}} (to name a few)\n\n> Your second statement: I am aware of the concept of boycotting, but at the end of the day the only reason why you should buy a cosmetic item is if you like it.\n\nI do like it. \nI also like not having to pay 3000円 for a piece of meat.\n\n> Third statement: That's like... your opinion.\n\nQuite simply: No. It's not.\n\nShortly after the release of Xayah and Rakan Riot made an official post stating that Xayah and Rakan would always receive matching skins, to keep with the couple theme.  Rioters have also commented on multiple reddit and boards threads confirming that it was always Riot's intent to give them matching skins.\n\n> but it's not based on the fans, it's based on the professional player.\n\nYet Riot often says no to the pros.  Faker wanted Ahri.  Shy wanted Riven.  Duke wanted Gnar.\nSo it's not really up to the pros either.  Riot's main objective is to make money, they do that by selling shit to people who want it.  They'd be stupid to not listen to what the people who are actually buying the crap want.\n\n> You'd be happier keeping your collection up to date than trying boycott them\n\nI'd be happier if in the future Riot kept their word.\nSo i'm willing to have a little unhappiness now, in the hope that the future might be better.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2019-04-29T23:47:13.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Or just do yourself  a  favour like me and uninstall the game","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
