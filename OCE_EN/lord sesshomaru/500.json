Technically you&#039;re not &quot;in combat&quot; nor have you taken/received any damage. But the disguise still breaks anyway.\r\n\r\nWhat&#039;s the reasoning for that?\r\nIt is contrary to both descriptions of her passive.\r\n\r\nI have tested this while wearing moba boots, and I can confirm that when she winds up an auto against a champion, she breaks disguise but the moba boots do NOT lose their MS or go on cooldown. Despite them both being supposedly affected by the same &quot;in combat&quot; status.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-zephyr}} \r\n\r\nThe way I see it, in the name of clarity and standardisation, something has to change:\r\nEither the coding of Neeko&#039;s passive.\r\nThe wording of Neeko&#039;s passive\r\nOr the coding of every other &#039;in combat&#039; ability item in the game.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[{"poster":"slxw","date":"2019-01-06T04:00:23.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm totally picking up what your putting down, Neeko is a pain in the lady parts, but â€¦\nToday I was gifted the \"Aww Yiss\" emote from a free MWC.\nSo you ask if being in auto range, auto attacking and cancelling said auto is not in combat because of the no damage part then I say....\nAww yiss you are in combat, Aww yiss.\n\n\nI am also just bragging about my new emote (tx) so don't take my word for it.\n{{item:2420}}","replies":[]}]}
