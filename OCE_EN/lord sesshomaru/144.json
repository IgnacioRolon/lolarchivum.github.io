For example:\r\n\r\n1. Im not the kind of guy that takes pleasure in my own team&#039;s misfortunes, but Im finding a sly smirk on my face whenever I see someone on my team declare their pick as Yasuo. The naivet&eacute; is just so juicy! Seeing it banned right out from under them **every time**, and knowing it is coming is just somehow so satisfying xD\r\n\r\n2. I don&#039;t dislike blind pick at all, for a while a long time ago I was actually pro-blind over draft, and I thought having draft would just be a nice treat every now and then when its up, but having draft pick up now and tasting it, makes blind pick feel so so much worse... \r\nDraft is up, I immediately ban Lee Sin, my team bans Zed, the enemy bans Yasuo, Darius also gets caught up in the crossfire. The enemy team picks a real mid laner, so I show them the same courtesy and pick a champ that I wouldn&#039;t usually play, we have a mid lane like the good old days used to be, mage vs mage, poke vs poke, with actual mana, none of that energy or flow crap! it&#039;s great!\r\nNext game, I go to pick draft... but obviously in Aussie it&#039;s a different time, because draft is no longer there! So I click blind. Get camped all game by lvl 7 Lee who spams his mastery every time he does anything. Now that is nothing out of the ordinary, but after knowing that you _could_ be playing a game without that shit, just makes it feel so much worse.\r\n\r\n3. I actually find myself playing League less now O_o\r\nIt&#039;s spoilt me! Every time I want to play, I log on, hover over blind pick and just pause, I want to press the button, I want to play, but I know Lee Sin is waiting there, behind that button.  And the little voice in my head says: &quot;Why? Why put yourself through that, when later on in the day, you wont have to.&quot; and I think: &quot;Maybe... maybe I just don&#039;t play?.. maybe.. maybe I play Elder Scrolls Online instead, just until Draft is up?&quot;. I would rather play league than work on mindless crafting and motif farming all day on ESO, but the alternative is Lee Sin...\r\nBefore when there wasn&#039;t an option, there was no choice, if you wanted to play league, you just had to deal with whatever came your way! But now, you know that in a few hours you&#039;ll be able to play in peace against like-minded people, so if you do play now, and you get Yasuo and Lee Sin and all the rest, it feels worse because it&#039;s self inflicted! because you know could have simply avoided the heartache by just playing later on in the day.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s strange xD\r\nBut I am so thankful and grateful that Draft is here now!\r\nThe small taste just makes me want it so much more!!","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2017-09-24T13:30:37.327+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been saying for a long time that if OCE is going to only have one queue, it should be Draft Pick. The games are generally so much more satisfying, calling roles is no longer a problem, and you get a chance to change Rune & Mastery pages to mitigate hard match-ups.\n\nUnfortunately, queue health will be a big issue if Riot brings back Draft Queue because the playerbase will potentially be split across Blind, Draft, SoloQ, Flex, 3v3 and the Featured Game Mode depending on the day of the week (which leads back to my first statement - if we have to have one Normal Q, it should be Draft Pick).","replies":[{"poster":"DarkSoul1994","date":"2017-09-24T13:32:05.610+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.
