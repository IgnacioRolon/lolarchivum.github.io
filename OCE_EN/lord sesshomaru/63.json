He gets 1.25 skins a year. Seems a little unfair, id love to find out how RIOT chooses (if they choose at all, and its not just a lottery) which champions get skins. \nin any case both Darkstar skins look epic as!\n\nAlthough Darkstar {{champion:136}} was a missed opportunity, even if it is a bit &#039;obvious&#039;.","replies":[{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-06-02T06:16:54.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Annie needs more skins.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-06-02T10:00:11.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dark Star Annie - \"Starring\" Space Bear.
