It would be nice to know the reasoning behind it. \r\n\r\nFor example Zed, Zed has been a problem all year, his ban rate is almost in the 80% now and has been at 50%+ for at least 6 weeks before that. and only now after all that time do they put a change to Zed on the PBE. (and not even to his slipperiness and mobility which is the real problem) \r\n\r\nQSS is another one, there is only really 1 reason people really buy QSS, and thats so that you have some form of counterplay for Zed. QSS hasn&#039;t been touched in patches for god knows how long, and then the first time they touch it in ages is to remove the very thing that people buy it for and buff a champion that is already picked/banned in every game. \r\n\r\nThe recent Azir changes on PBE also, Azir is a bit of a problem atm (and he&#039;s my main, and even I&#039;m admitting it) but he is strong because of his relatively safe long distance mega sustained damage. NOT the fact that his ult gives you an almost negligible speed boost when you walk through it. So why the hell would you remove the tiny speed boost and forget about his damage and poke? i just cant understand, he isn&#039;t picked and banned so often because he has a little speed boost every 140 seconds... so why think that is the problem?? Also his casting W on turrets, you take that away, and yet give Ziggs the ability to execute 2 turrets under 30% HP at the same time... Azir&#039;s W doesnt do anything close to 30% damage to just 1 turret. So why?? Im happy that Azir is getting nerfed, he needs it, for an analogy lets pretend patching is a boxing match, he&#039;s a big guy who&#039;s very strong so why throw punches at his hair and clothing? why not hit him in the stomach or the face where it really counts?? You&#039;ll never take down a giant by punching the locks of his hair.\r\n\r\nI also don&#039;t like that Azir has so many interesting little features play with and around that makes him so interesting, and slowly since his birth, they have been stripped away one by 1, first the E knock up goes, then his CDR/AS passive, now his Ult speed boost and his W turret utility, not to mention over halving the time his ult stands for.  Please don&#039;t turn him into a damage-only mindless machine... I thought with all the new and interesting champion changes that we had escaped that style of playing...\r\n\r\nI just want to know why they always skirt around major issues and change all these things that don&#039;t need to be changed. There has to be a reason. what is it?","replies":[{"poster":"catch this work","date":"2016-06-01T01:28:03.932+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget how they refuse to nerf Kindred's passive+actually make the early game junglers in general less oppressive. For 2 years now I've had to deal with Lee sin, Elise and recently now, Kindred in the jungle. They're the definition of anti-fun and non-interactive counterplay. I am aware that they are high skill cap champs, especially Lee. However, I'm going to express EVERY issue I have with this. First of all, to get bias out of the way, they nerfed Rengar over Lee, Elise and Kindred.....Rengar.....I understand he had amazing burst before the patch and was pretty reliable, but, it's so easy to deny him, the moment a pink is placed down and one rogue CC hits, he dies, simple as that. Same thing to be said about Yi, they nerfed his Ultimate for no good reason while at the same time removed sated. Meanwhile, Lee sin has such combos as QRQ, which Q does MISSING % HP DMG. Like wtf? They removed Kha'zix's missing hp dmg on his Evolved Q, why should Lee keep it? In addition Lee has unparalleled mobility, so even if some damage was removed, he's still top tier, easily. Elise as well has balance issues, mainly relating to her synergy with the jungle item and her % hp in her kit+1.7 sec long stun, however, she's a lot more negligable that the other two. \n\nOnto the main issue, Kindred. She's been nerfed and changed 5 times since released and yet, they refuse to nerf her where it counts most. Such nerfs would include giving her Ultimate an 0.8 sec long cast time, so that they can't instantly press R and deny, there's a window to counter it. Another one would be nerfing her % damage passive so that it is 1% flat, not 1.125% or whatever it is, that way it's a healthy change, not major, but big enough to make Kindred think about buildpaths in a better sense. Nerfing her E to a 40% slow was another healthy change as it made her less oppressive, as was changing her W to be more about scaling and extended fights. However, my view on Kindred is she needs her W heal removed to make her clears less reliant and safe, her Ultimate needs to be given a longer cast time and her passive needs to be nerfed ever so slightly so that she doesn't just roflstomp when ahead.\n\nIn terms of other lanes, ADC is VERY oppressive right now. I can't even express how busted Lucian is, I don't think anyone can. A build which scales AND synergises with his entire kit, the Youmuu's+Black cleaver build is utter nonsense. Not to mention it applies stacks from his Ulti alone, and gets him to 40% CDR with Lucidity boots. Another honourable mention down in the bot lane is Alistar. Even after nerfing his Ulti he's still stupidly good, -maybe it's because of his Malphite Ulti on a 20 sec CD- to that you are correct. That combo eventually goes down to ~14 late game, the heal is generally ignored as is his passive. So in terms of balancing I would like for the stun from Headbutt to be removed. As for Lucian nerfs, I would imagine that a base AD nerf would be the best course of action, same to his health regen. Just small base stats which would help other ADCs feel relevant when laning and fighting against Lucian.\n\nMid lane wise, we're looking mainly at Azir, Kassadin, Anivia and Fizz being the worst offenders (discluding Malzahar since he's so broken it's not worth discussing). Azir, much like you said had a bad balance decision, being the nerf to his Ulti., I do disagree with what they did. I again agree that his poke needs attention, so my idea is that Azir's W damage is nerfed on its base damage and upped on its scaling, that way Azir is even weaker in the early game, giving other laners a chance to snowball while he's weak. In addition, you do have to agree that Q's cooldown should be longer at max rank even with 40% max CDR as 4 seconds is hardly fair, there needs to be more time to exploit his soldier's positioning. His passive also needs a slight change, being the tower HP decay, as such I would think that his tower lasting 1 minute is too long, instead, making it 45sec makes it more fair. \nOnto Kassadin, a very delicate case. My first thought, nerf his W damage, both scaling and base, it has too much scaling with Lich bane and too much damage early ESPECIALLY for melee laners. Another nerf could be to his Q, giving it an even longer CD early game will make Kassadin players less braindead about spamming it onto their opponent and more strategic about using the shield to potentially get a good trade or last hits.\nAnivia, simply put....nerf the cooldown on Egg. Every other Ress. passive is on like a 5 minute cooldown, why should Anivia be any exception? Nerfing her E is also a must, that ability has far too much base damage, instead move some of that damage over to Q. Base stat changes would also be nice, like base MR+base AD (ik this seems weird, but it prevents Anivia from being oppressive early game due to it giving her farming issues early).\nFizz now. Fizz is honestly everyone's pet hate, even the Fizz players themselves. First of all, nerf the Ultimate hitbox, it's waaaaayyyy too big, and for what it does it's hardly fair for it to be that way. Also, giving his E an addition 1 second CD at all ranks will make it so that with 40% CDR rank 5 E will be 5 sec instead of 4, which is rather meaningful. Lastly, nerfing his passive so that he can no longer walk through creeps would be another thing, move that part to his Q, so that when he Qs he gets 2 secs of no unit collision.\n\nTop lane, braindead tanks, nuff said. Change Sunfire...again...change Iceborn...again.....change Visage....again. It's season 4 all over again, this time with more item choices for tanks. The easiest way around unhealthy changes would be to change the base stats of abilities. Namely those of Malphite, Maokai, Trundle, Nautlilus and Poppy. Simply put, moving the damage to other sources would make tanks think twice about leveling the same skill in a certain order EVERY game.  In addition, nerfing base HP of tanks would make their early game less boring and non-interactive and jungler-reliant. Pretty much, I'm advising that top lane be changed to an interactive lane, not a full on stall fest where whoever gets the better TP wins the lane+game. \n\n\nThose are all the nerfs I would like to see Riot do.
