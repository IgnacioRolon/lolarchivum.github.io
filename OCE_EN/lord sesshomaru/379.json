Yeah he's pretty good at deleting ADC's and squishies but he's no better at it than any other Assasin like zed or talon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2016-09-02T12:48:46.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Need to learn his weakness and strengths. in mid/high elo you can beat a rengar so easy cause they know what his weakness is but in low elo say Bronze, Silver, gold of course his going to trash on everyone cause they don't care about the game and have no intention to stop and think about buying a pink ward or grouping and fighting they think for themselves. There are other ways other then just disabling him until assassin rework and their are others that can take his place with ease its just that everyone is getting nerfed and cause he was having trouble before with these meta picks now that they have been nerfed his starting to shine through patch after patch.","replies":[]}]}
