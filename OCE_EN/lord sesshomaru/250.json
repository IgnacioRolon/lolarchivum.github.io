And seeming the point of a &#039;game&#039; is entertainment, fun should be the goal. \r\n\r\nDying twice in lane and then popping up the surrender vote every 3 minutes for the next 40 minutes, saying _&quot;We can&#039;t win this&quot;_ is just disgusting.\r\n_(and in ranked there just shouldn&#039;t be the option)_\r\n\r\nLearning to play into a losing game is an extremely valuable skill, that you just don&#039;t acquire if you always surrender as soon as the enemy team gains the upper hand.\r\n\r\n_________________\r\n\r\nCase in point, the screenshot shown.\r\n\r\nThis was a game I played last night.\r\nYes, we did lose. And that was due to a bad fight on our part at around 55 minutes. Up until then, this game could have easily gone either way.\r\n\r\nThe point is: \r\nMorgana never loaded in, so she was AFK from the very beginning.\r\nZoe, _bless her heart_, had 4 kill participation (out of 47), only did 18,000 damage (as Zoe), and only had 5000 more gold than Morgana, in a **1 hour game.**\r\n\r\nSo It was for all intents and purposes, this was a 3v5.\r\nWe didn&#039;t just hold on, we matched them head to head. \r\n\r\nThis game could have gone any way up until around 55 minutes. \r\nWhy? **Because we knew how to play into a disadvantage**.\r\nWe weren&#039;t in the habit of surrendering, we had done our time being steamrolled in games, and we knew how to change our play-styles to account for the situation. The surrender vote never popped up in the whole game _(not even for a remake)_.\r\nWe had so much fun, and we were so close to winning a 3v5, next time we will win because of what we learnt in this game.\r\n\r\nSo next time you pop up that vote, just think long and hard. \r\nAlmost no game is completely unwinable, and if you do stick it out and still lose, you&#039;ll be just that much better next time you&#039;re in that situation.\r\n_(I&#039;ve come back on multiple occasions from our nexus being on 50 HP, and then winning.)_\r\n\r\nI think that&#039;s one of the reasons you get so many one-sided steamroll games in this elo, is because a vast number of people just don&#039;t have a clue how to play into a losing game.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-11-19T00:23:29.167+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"If i'm in a 4v5 (as the 4) their should be no reason for the enemy team to lose (unless someone is inting) i completely disagree, fun or not, if you can't win a game just ff go next, its easier to waste 15 than to waste 60, \n\nI played a 92 min game about 2-3 months ago, 4v5, we spent the majority of the game 20k gold under, why, because aside from me as a 7/4/39 thresh and my duo as a 1/6/45 sejuani, my team had everyone on our team inted, when we went for the ff vote, they said no, every time, 92 mins, stuck in an unwinnable game, being held hostage by 3 %%%%s is not my definition of fun, especially when the 3 %%%%s are the ones casuing the game to lose\n\nContext\nthey load in, their buddy disconnects after remake vote timer, then they spend the game running it down, i get a mid with 14 deaths, and top with 23 deaths, and im stuck solo bot as thresh, we have no jg, since my duo had to consistently come bot, the enemy played with their food for the game, so we were stuck unable to surrender, and the enemies wouldn't end.\n\nYou can't play into a game that's lost because of 3 trolls, not possible, maybe if you're the mid or adc playing a hyper carry, but otherwise, that's fucking impossible, FF needs to be a vote, and if you get trolls you should legally be allowed to leave without punishment, with manual review proving that there was no point sticking around\n\nMaybe if the gold deficit is equalish like 2-3k either side then you could play it out, but if i see a game thats going nowhere, for example an adc that runs head first into the enemy team, then blames me when he dies, even though i'm oom or not even in lane (post-back/death), or a jg with no presence (who is also getting outfarmed) there is no point in playing that, again if you're the hyper carry  and can 1v9 then go for it, but i don't feel a want to play a lost game.\n\nKeeping in mind, i'm very analytical, i look at kda/CS/vis score/team comp/tower takedowns/etc. if i see stats (in-game, often proved right post-game) and they're sounding alarm bells, i will not bother playing the game out, unless it changes before 20 (pre 20 votes are pointless since its not majority rules)\n\nFF > Playing it out","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-11-19T08:06:33.040+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I live for the days when people like you are on the enemy team ^^\nYou make it so easy, because I don't need to play to win, I just need to play to make you think you'll lose.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-11-19T09:39:18.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"This thead is filled with so many bias statements, that it is hard to swallow any of this pep talk.\n\nYou've only considered the side why people shouldnt surrender, and failed to bring up any issues that cast the surrender vote in the 1st place.\n\nYes, there are games where people gave up too soon, and there are also games when continuing it will cause more harms then goods. \n\nWhy do you keep bringing up these points and glorify it. \n> Because we knew how to play into a disadvantage.\n> don't have a clue how to play into a losing game.\n>Almost no game is completely unwinable.\n\nYou are under the assumption, that the other 5 people on the enemy team is beneath you and yours; And the members of the team is in harmony with each other.\n\nDo you know why korean solo Q is so famous?

Not fight every single one.\n\nYour logic angers me.\n\n\"koreans play solo queue to win, that is why THEY LOSE ON FUCKING PURPOSE!\"\n\nYou only get to play every game once, if you lose that game, you can never get that potential victory back, you have to play 2 MORE games and WIN BOTH which is about an hour MINIMUM just to have the same outcome of winning that one game.\n\nSo you claim that it is not worth spending 20-30 more minutes fighting like hell and managing to pull out a win 1 in every 3 games (that is with the rest of my team feeding complaining and afk). Instead you would rather people go into a new game with the exact same chance to play like shit and have everyone on your team feed again.\n\nThe only possible reason for quitting a losing game early and moving onto the next one would be if time was the main factor to your rank INSTEAD of WIN RATIO.\n\nHere is how your logic should be:\n\nPlayers who play for fun should stick to normals, if they are not having fun, then they can surrender vote because they want to have fun, are not having it yet, and they can try again next game.\n\nPlayers who play to win should stick to ranked and never give up because they are literally playing for MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. Honestly, surrendering should straight up just be taken out of ranked altogether. I have won games because the fed carry on the enemy team disconnected. Afkers should be punished by being unable to play ranked for the next 10 games or so.\n\nBetter yet, encourage riot to give us an ADDITIONAL queue that promotes people playing well, instead of stealing from their own team and hindering each other.\n\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/s4h1fH1w-why-not-have-2-seperate-ranking-system-queues","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-11-19T13:26:38.378+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> You've only considered the side why people shouldnt surrender, and failed to bring up any issues that cast the surrender vote in the 1st place.\n\nIkr, It's almost like I'm not campaigning for that side of the argument?

Minors have to register with the government and be monitored to prevent them playing too much.\n\nSomething tells me they probably aren't the society we should be modelling our ideal gaming view off hmm?","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-11-20T07:15:22.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-11-20T10:43:01.870+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im so sorry, you're going to have to say most of that again, in comprehensible language.\n\nFrom what I did understand:\n\nYou're basing your ideology on assuming that winning is the primary function of the game?\n\nIt's not.\n\nThe primary function of the game (aside from being a business) is entertainment.\nSo as long as players are entertained, they are fulfilling the primary function of the game.\nRiot doesn't care how you are entertained.\nThe concept of trying to win is just the easiest form that entertainment takes.\n\nYou don't play a game to win.  You play a game for fun, and it's more fun when you win.\n\nWinning in itself, (as an isolated concept) is meaningless. \nIt's like winning a coin toss, you won, but winning without context has no value attributed to it.\nYou can sit there flipping a coin alone in your room all day, but it doesn't matter how many times you 'win' the toss, it won't bring you any satisfaction.\n\nIt's the context (such as entertainment) that gives winning value.\n\nYou can have games that are fun where there is no concept of winning or losing, like minecraft or playing with leggo. Therefore winning is not integral to enjoyment.\n\nIn league, the 'prize' for winning, is virtual points that are themselves meaningless outside the game.  \nWhich means you don't go to league for the sole reason of earring the points.  Because without the context of the game, they have no meaning.\n\nThere are two things that give these virtual tokens worth.\n\n1. Improving the quality of life in the virtual world.\n\n2. Pitting yourself against another human being, and proving yourself better than them.\n\n1st, If there was no interface, and league was just binary code. Winning wouldn't be fun would it? No sick borders, mastery flairs or Star Dragons.  So clearly we care about the 'quality' of the virtual landscape. So obviously winning can't be the primary goal, otherwise we would all settle for binary code.\n\n2nd, if pitting yourself against another human and being better than them is the goal.

You play a game for fun, and it's more fun when you win.`Winning in itself, (as an isolated concept) is meaningless. \n\nThis concept of fun you are talking about, varies from person to person; Or even in different situations. \n\n* Are you playing among your friends, and the **fun **is to make each other laugh?. If so, winning dont matter as much.\n\n* Are you playing on your own and you want to win because it give you progression. Then the kind of fun you are looking for is victory.\n\n>_It's like winning a coin toss, you won, but winning without context has no value attributed to it.\n_\n\nThis is a competitive game, you are vsing other people. The sastisfaction of victory derive from meeting your goals; Whatever it might be. Winning is an approval of one's ability, and a proof of superiority. Cointoss without a quest to aim for is as you say. worthless. \n\nBut league is far more complex than a simple cointoss repetition. Losing has a lot of negatives than failing to land head, playing an aimless simulation. The enemy taunts , your team flaming, lost of progression, wasting time with nothing to shown for. ETC...\n\n>You can have games that are fun where there is no concept of winning or losing, like minecraft or playing with leggo. Therefore winning is not integral to enjoyment.\n\nGame like minecraft is a progression based game. The fun is accomplishing your objectives. If there is no target to aim for, then anything they do will seem menial and pointless.\n\n>You're basing your ideology on assuming that winning is the primary function of the game?\n\nDepending how industrious, and how high up in conscientiousness you are as a person. Your concept of **fun **will change. An achievement oriented person will find the concept of winning to be more important, fun come from victory. And the opposite can be said for people whose traits is the reserve; They dont care whether they win or lose. Time is aplenty and the input of efforts is low. \n\nIt come down to personality traits, and how people see it from their point of view. There is no one size fit all. You're representing your type of people. **Not everyone**.
