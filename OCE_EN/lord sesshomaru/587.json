(Focus on PF Thresh)","subforum":"Miscellaneous","embed":{"description":"Post with 0 views.","url":"https://imgur.com/a/evEZgKt","image":"https://i.imgur.com/inIvdHG.jpg?fb"},"up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not to beat a dead horse, but I think most people agree that this thresh skin is horrendous.\nI don't hope to accomplish anything with this post, but I do want to draw attention to Riot's attitude towards skins, and how this skin stabs everything they've said on that topic in the back.\n\nLets break this down:\n\n**Riot very proudly announced, on multiple occasions, that they'll only make skins for champions if they can marry the concept and the champion perfectly.  **_(e.g. they aren't going to just force a new skin on Ornn just because he doesn't have any.  They want to wait until someone has a really good idea that happens to fit that champ to a T.)_  **This skin proves how much of a lie that was.**\n\n1. **A Forced Skin.** Most people seem to agree that there isn't a more forced skin in the game.  Pulsefire?  For Thresh? Really?  Can you look us in the eye and say with a straight face, that out of all the concepts the team could think of, no other theme fit Thresh better than Pulsefire?  Battle-Boss Thresh,  Guardian of the Sands Thresh, Elderwood Thresh, none of those were as good as Pulsefire?  And why Thresh? of all the champions in the game, was Thresh really the next best fit join the Pulsefire crew?  Senna, Zed, Quinn, Vayne, Lucian, even Jhin?  You're saying that Thresh, someone who drags literal chains everywhere he goes, was the best fit for a nimble time-hopping peacekeeper?  This is the biggest forced skin since Dark Star Jarvan. _(or Hextech Jarvan for that matter.. Someone up there must really like Jarvan?)_\n\n2. **Appearance.** Having a skin that doesn't fit a champ perfectly is not actually that big of a deal to a lot of people.  I'm sure that most players would just appreciate playing a skin for their main.  Hell, mecha Sol wasn't exactly the epitome of a perfect fit, but I still enjoyed using it _(pre-sol rework)_. But what does matter a LOT, is when the skin looks terrible too.  Admittedly _(and to their credit)_ they made some changes after the bombardment of hate they received, it was a band-aid, but it didn't fix the skin.  He still looks like Azir.  His hair is still incredibly rigid and strange.  and he still looks so similar to Championship Thresh. _(like seriously, compare those two lanterns, their shape and colour is so so similar.)_\n\n3. **Prestige.** This is perhaps the most awkward part.  Not only is it a very sub par skin that even Thresh mains cringe at, but it was actually chosen to receive a Prestige skin too.  And to add insult to injury, the Prestige version is well regarded to be even worse!  The lantern change is pretty cool, especially seeming it isn't a fried egg anymore.  But it's too little too late unfortunately.\n\n4. **Yet another Skin?** Thresh has a very decent number of skins, not only that, but they are all very good quality skins too _(perhaps with the exception of SSW)_.  And it wasn't so long ago that he received High Noon either.  Now he gets an extra 2? _(well, one and a Half really)_.  If you are going to force fit skin themes onto champs, at least do it to someone who is in need of a new skin.  Neither Pulsefire Thresh nor Pulsefire Ornn would work well, but if you have to choose, at least throw the Ornn mains a bone.\n\n5. **\"It's too late to change.\"** This part makes me question why they bother to put skins on the PBE in the first place.  The day that they put the skin up on the PBE, it attracted a huge volume of hate comments, to which a Rioter responded _(and I quote)_: **\"Thank you for the feedback! It's very useful to hear the specifics of what players like and dislike.  Unfortunately, there's not much that can be done for the design at this point.  I will pass everything along to the team. Thanks again!\"**  Why bother putting skins up in the beta testing area, if same-day feedback is already too late to make changes?? Admittedly they changed some particles in the end _(or risked many players boycotting)_, but nothing to the skin itself.  Perhaps the funniest part about all this though, is the image I have attached.  After saying \"It's too late to make changes\" they release the skin _(and V Aatrox, another skin that was ill-received)_ along-side a message that says they that they have gone and made changes to skin content that HAS ALREADY BEEN IN LIVE SERVERS FOR WEEKS!  I was in stitches when I saw that. Especially seeming the players hatred for Thresh's Azir head, far far far outweighs the small preference people have about Ekko's hairline..\n\nIf you say _\"We only release skins for champs that fit the theme perfectly\"_  and then release a skin like Dark Star Jarvan or Pulsefire thresh, you're admitting two things.\n\n1.  No one at Riot with all the creatives in their employ, could think of a better skin concept for Thresh. _(or a better champ fit for Pulsefire, whichever way around you want to look at it)_\n2.  Fan creations are not considered at all.  _(because there are literally hundreds of fan-made skins that are miles better than this)_\n\nOverall, this post is not meant to accomplish anything, it's just me venting at how mad it makes me when they make these promises, and then contradict themselves at almost every turn.  If you're going to force skins onto champs that don't suit it, and/or don't need any more skins.  There is absolutely no reason why you can't pop out some skins for champs like Taliyah and Ornn that don't have any.\n\nMy apologies to those who endured the entirety of this post.","replies":[{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-11-23T00:55:35.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he's the ghost in the matrix lol, Thresh was a cruel jailer in life and there are lots of cruel people nowadays so a cruel Thresh in the future isn't a surprise, especially with how people high up don't address global warming because they stand to lose profit and are in charge to be difficult as they can until enough people have had enough of their poop or they've corrupted so long they can make the troublemakers \"disappear\"","replies":[]}]}
