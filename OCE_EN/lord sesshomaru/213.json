Although, I've found that some players only use pings to annoy others and never actually use it to communicate with the team.\n\nI've had junglers get counter-jungled and start a fight with the enemy without notifying the team. After they die they spam pings at their location and complain that the team won't help. \n\nSure players should have map awareness, but we all have moments of tunnel visioning in lane when facing tough enemies. Pinging doesn't ensure your allies will respond, but it will make sure they can either warn you to run because they're busy or more often than not, they will respond.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VeganCrossfitter","date":"2016-04-12T12:39:17.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"how many smurfs did you upvote yourself on...","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-04-12T18:51:54.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-04-10T18:31:18.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"!!!?!?!?!?!!?!!!!?!?!??!!!!","replies":[]}]}
