But where do Zaun and piltover reside? Are they cities in demacia/noxus or do they have their own lands? What about Ionia? Im guessing it borders on noxus/zaun because they have wars between the countries. \r\n\r\nThe lore stories have peaked my interest, and I&#039;d like to try my hand at writing my own at some point.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-11-03T12:55:56.893+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes there is a rough map.
