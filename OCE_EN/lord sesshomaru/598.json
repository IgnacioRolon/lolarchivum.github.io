Is he an assassin? Or is he a fighter?\n\nIf he is an assassin, he needs to only have access to his crit in short bursts. So he can burst down squishies, but not have sustained damage to destroy tanks.\n\nif he is a fighter, he needs a harsher penalty on his crit, but have crit available for longer,  so he can't burst down squishes instantly, but can hold his own against tanks.","replies":[]}]}]}
