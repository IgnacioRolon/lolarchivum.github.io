I laughed more than I should have on that matter though, wasn't even mad. But yeah, visually the Y axis is there, but it's actually not, per-say. It's an illusion! As for OP's question, it's not really a knock-up in fact Terra covered this so I won't repeat.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotTerra","date":"2015-01-08T17:20:50.220+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, that was for sure a bug (despite being pretty funny... haha).\n\nFun fact - although I'm not 100% sure if it is still true - When Vladimir is in his pool, his character model is just hanging out beneath the map (again, this is using the y-axis to visually achieve something, with no gameplay implications - except for this bug). I think there was a bug at one point where you could still cast Zhonyas in his pool, which would result in him not coming back up until it was done. This resulted in time where his pool was gone, but his character model wasn't translated back up to the map, so it was just like \"where the *$#@ did Vlad go!?!?\".","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-01-08T17:41:20.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotTerra,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=yx5VZVzr,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-01-08T17:20:50.220+0000)\n>\n> Yeah, that was for sure a bug (despite being pretty funny... haha).\n> \n> Fun fact - although I'm not 100% sure if it is still true - When Vladimir is in his pool, his character model is just hanging out beneath the map (again, this is using the y-axis to visually achieve something, with no gameplay implications - except for this bug).

I assume Riot was aware of that as it was fixed rather quickly. But yeah Vlad kinda chills under the map when he pools.. I think or above it, complicated stuff.\n\nBack in my noob days I used to try and trist Rocket Jump over autos to dodge them.. lol.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-01-08T22:38:36.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thanks for clearing it up for me :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2015-01-08T23:29:14.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think its because it can knock enemies in any direction as apposed to just a knock back","replies":[]}]}
