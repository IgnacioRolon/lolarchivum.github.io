This week it's voice over work, a glance at vision scores, and Yasuo's frequent visits to the ban bin.. Yasuo fan art by OrekiGenya Honestly? Yasuo is badass. He's a lethal Ronin-esque character that can pull off slick moves in game, dashing and slashing everywhere, leaving chaos and death behind him...at least when he's on the enemy team.","url":"http://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/2017/06/ask-riot-yasuo-gets-banned/","image":"http://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/LOL_CMS_096_Social_1200.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**But If Azir is going down, i&#039;m taking you with me!**\n\nBut seriously, this was unexpected.\n\nI suppose admitting there is a problem is the first step towards healing.\nBut is a rework really the way to go?\n\nI feel like other reworks _(Brand/Zac/Sej/Darius etc.)_ have made things worse, not better.\nAnd god forbid this one should backfire....\n\nI honestly don&#039;t know what to think about this.\nOn one hand, I don&#039;t like when champs get reworked for balance reasons, It feels like a betrayal of that champion and their players, and if we are truly honest Yasuo is a really really really fun champion that many people enjoy! \n\nBut on the other hand, he is, and has pretty much always been a big problem in one capacity or another. And that&#039;s one of the reasons I wasn&#039;t too opposed to the latest LB update, because there didn&#039;t seem to be any other clear solution.\nSo I don&#039;t know what to think about this.\n\nIf he does get updated, I just hope that some of the stupid interactions with his wind-wall are fixed. _(Taliyah&#039;s R for example....
