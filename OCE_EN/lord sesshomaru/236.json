Make a lol team (or both teams) out of anime/comic heroes, and post it here. Either make one on photoshop etc, or just write it down. \r\n\r\nRules: \r\n1. Characters need to fit their roles, (for example having Wolverine as a support doesn&#039;t really work thematically.)\r\n2. The teams should be as balanced as possible, within the same team and with the other team, but within reason of course. (for example, having Goku and Superman vsing Ash Ketchum and Pikachu, probably isn&#039;t balanced)\r\n\r\nGuidelines (Completely Optional, just for a challenge):\r\n1. See if you can use only 1 character per anime/comic book. \r\n2. See if you can theme your teams (mine is themed as: Light VS Dark, and as: Monsters and Men VS Gods and Demons.)\r\n3. Describe why you have chosen each character for that role, and why they fit the Top laner/Mid laner mentality. \r\n\r\n**My Blue team:**\r\n\r\nTop lane: Kenpachi Zaraki _Bleach_\r\nBasically like Darius, an off tank with insane damage and survivability, goes into a 1v5 looking for at least a triple kill, but lacks interesting/intelligent play and any escapes.\r\n\r\nJungle: Lord Sesshomaru _Inuyasha_ \r\nA roaming AP/Hyrbid bruiser, has decent burst but also not bad sustained damage, is tankyish for an AP (the RoA/Rylai&#039;s type tanky) has pretty much everything in his kit: Burst, Sustained, Healing, Movespeed, Semi-Tankiness, etc. But isn&#039;t the easiest to play and suffers in prolonged fights against his AD peers, he is much like Elise in these respects. \r\n\r\nMid Lane: Lord Tendo Pain (just the Deva path) _Naruto_\r\nA Swain-like AP bruiser that would be at home in either mid or top, medium damage and fairly tanky (again that AP/HP item, RoA tankiness), with major CC, one of those champs that you need to sit back and poke down before even thinking about going in. But needs to ration his abilities for fear of being caught out and being useless without them. \r\n\r\nADC: General Marion Cross _D-Gray Man_\r\nA mix between Jhin and Lucian, he uses a mega-ass revolver where every shot needs to count, but lacks Jhin&#039;s range, and whose abilities would resemble Lucians more than Jhin&#039;s (despite the passive) \r\n\r\nSupport: Sebastian Michaelis _Black Butler_\r\nLacks the tankiness of champs like Leona and the damage of champs like Annie, but instead has mega utility, and revolves around buffing his ADC and distracting the enemies, he would play rather like Bard/Lulu.\r\n\r\n**My Red team:**\r\n\r\nTop Lane: Gajeel Redfox _Fairytail_\r\nA damage orientated brawler that can still take a few hits, much like Wukong but without the escapes, probably would use AA enhancers and self buffs, with a smash-like skillshot or two (like illaoi&#039;s Q) \r\n\r\nJungle: Celty Sturluson _Durarara_\r\nVery Diana-like, mobile and agile with lots of burst damage and some small CC but lacks the survivability of other Junglers. She&#039;s got roaming in the bag, but relies on her laner&#039;s CC for successful ganks. \r\n\r\nMid: Captain Levi Ackerman _Attack on Titan_ \r\nIn a word: Talon. An assassin in every sense of the word, Great at jumping into a fight, cutting the head off the beast while &#039;accidentally&#039; dealing some AoE in the process, before getting the fuck out again. Mega burst damage with ave sustain, builds basically pure AD and MS, but is about as squishy as they come and has no CC to protect himself after missing his engage/disengages. \r\n\r\nADC: Yoko Littner _Gurren Lagan_ \r\nA mix between Caitlin and Corki, she has all the range and attack speed she needs with her electro rifle, and has a decent chunk of magic damage mixed in with the AD, she has a few little tricks up her sleeve for escapes, but ultimately when caught up close she&#039;s a goner.\r\n\r\nSupport: Alphonse Elric _Fullmetal Alchemist_\r\nFor those who know him I&#039;m sure your mind went straight to Nautilus, and thats just the role he&#039;d play, A tanky-as-fuck support who specialises in disruption and can rip just about anyone off his precious ADC. But is slow and finds it hard to hold his own in a 1v1 situation against a proper AD bruiser. However with a few HP/AP items he can deal a lot more damage than you would think he should be able to. \r\n\r\nI think these characters pretty much fit these roles, Kenpachi and Gajeel are both &#039;jump mindlessly into battle and beat the shit outta the opponent&#039; type characters which is a very Top lane mentality. Sesshomaru and Celty are very much wanderers and appear uninvited and unannounced at important events in the anime, and then disappear afterwards, which is obviously what junglers do. Pain has that tankish AP mentality of &#039;stay the fuck away from me or you&#039;ll regret it&#039; like swain/galio/Cho/Vlad type Mid/Top champs, while Levi is definitely an assassin, weaving in and out of fight striking at the weak spots, he has that mentality of &#039;a little closer... just a bit.. THEYRE IN RANGE!!!! KILLL THEMMMM... And now back out again, la-deee-daa.&#039; which is a very AD assassin type approach. Cross and Yoko have 3 things in common: Squishiness, Guns and Attitude. Which pretty much sums up ADC&#039;s. Where Sebastian and Alphonse are both very much Support characters in their anime as well, only engaging to save a friend or to assist someone else, Sebastian is a butler so thats his job anyway, and Alphonse is that &#039;Younger brother but actually protects the older one, and lets him be the famous one still.&#039; type character. \r\n\r\nI have used only 1 character per anime, and the theme is &#039;Monsters and Men VS Gods and Demons&#039; also &#039;Light VS Dark&#039;\r\n\r\nThey are relatively balanced teams, Kenpachi/Sesshomaru/Pain give a little too much power to Blue team however, but seeming Pain is just the Deva path; he has some serious weaknesses as well, and Sesshomaru has many different levels of power depending on what part of the anime we take him from, Kenpachi is always going to be a problem to just about anyone though, but thats the way darius is too i guess. It could be argued that Levi, Cross and Yoko don&#039;t fit in because unlike everyone else they are just normal humans and wouldn&#039;t stand a chance against Pain/Kenpachi normally, but Levi is capable of taking down massive titans and has probably the most speed/manouvarablity of all the characters here, while Cross is one of the 4 Generals of the Exorcists (so is among the 4 most powerful humans alive in that universe) and his gun is specialised for slaying Demons (which most of the enemy team consists of) and Yoko has a electro gun that has enough power to take down fully armoured mecha suits, so its bound to at least put a very decent sized dent in Kenpachi, so i don&#039;t think any of them would be easy prey.\r\n\r\nWell your turn now, you don&#039;t have to write as much as me obviously, I&#039;m just showing people the spirit of the game.\r\n\r\nid love to see what you come up with :)\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2016-04-10T10:16:50.990+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the only team I'll ever need is Inferno Cop\nhttp://i.imgur.com/AAqvJjR.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-04-09T13:58:16.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"weeaboo. \n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"OCE Yisus","date":"2016-04-10T10:10:46.213+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Proud to be one","replies":[{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-04-10T12:26:14.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-04-09T14:31:14.165+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I really hope this is an elaborate troll.","replies":[]}]}
