GG!!!&quot; its good being with high lvl ppl because you can learn from them, but I&#039;m so outclassed atm i cant do anything at all. I play twisted fate a lot and because his skin just ahem out I&#039;m playing him even more, and I&#039;m vsing diamond Zed&#039;s and Kat&#039;s and its just not happening.\r\n\r\nwhy is this happening? this screenshot is one i took, I&#039;m gangplank, and the victor turned out to be platinum 1 or something.\r\nand I&#039;m not duo&#039;ing","replies":[{"poster":"Yondas","date":"2015-07-24T08:04:31.296+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because a lot of high ranked players don't play norms and now they might be playing a few normal games to see how shit the new hud design is and play for the event thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-24T08:03:21.266+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because of the icon rewards, people who just flat out don't play normal's, are playing normals.\n\nEDIT: and if this is ARAM's, some people NEVER play ARAM's.","replies":[]}]}
