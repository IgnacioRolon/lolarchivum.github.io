Two seconds before expiry, it unleashes a missile volley dealing 650 true damage over the remaining time to nearby all enemies.&quot; \n\n&quot;Places a long range ballista at 2200 range of an enemy turret. After 5 seconds delay, it will begin firing at the nearest enemy turret, dealing heavy damage, if the targeted turret expires. The ballista will as well.&quot;\n\n&quot;Allows team to repeatedly cast flash in a limited zone.&quot;\n\nI doubt they are being implemented into normal games, so is this some kind of new Siege game mode? (maybe hextech related?) If so, how come the items are on display but we havent heard anything about it? (or maybe we have and I&#039;m just out of the loop?)\n\neither way, anyone keen to share some knowledge?\n\n{{item:3632}} {{item:3637}} {{item:3643}} {{item:3640}} {{item:3635}} {{item:3647}} {{item:3631}} {{item:3642}} {{item:3630}} {{item:3633}} {{item:3648}} {{item:3634}} {{item:3636}} {{item:3641}}","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-07-05T09:15:35.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are are the Nexus Siege items... how have you not heard about this?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-07-05T09:48:19.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing has been posted on the Oce website or the client? how many websites am i supposed to be checking to get such fundamental news??","replies":[{"poster":"Corehog","date":"2016-07-05T10:25:48.686+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A bunch of youtubers have been doing videos of Nexus Seige, but other than that I haven't really seen any news.\n\nRed Mercy does a gameplay and explanation of how it works [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAVJetzLQs)","replies":[]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-07-05T12:52:02.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you have never heard of this?
