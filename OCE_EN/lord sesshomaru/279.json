It's also possible it wasn't in the patch notes at all, maybe it got missed.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-04-18T09:45:19.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a quick squiz at the patch notes back until 7.1 and couldn't find anything relevant to this feature. Either it wasn't mentioned at all or it was just a single instance (likely ages ago).\n\nHonestly, I'm surprised Riot didn't announce this feature and just go \"we'll be using this to assess reports regarding multiple players attempting to take the same role/position\". Would solve so many problems with insta-lockers, trolls and people who just don't want to cooperate.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-18T11:53:05.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not anything so advanced as that. It's basically just a different way of typing. All it would accomplish would be people typing /me chooses [role] and having it show up in a diff font instead of just typing what role they want.\n\nIt's just a formatting command, not any kind of selection based command.\n\nAt best it's become the 'formal' way of calling a role but then you'd just have people arguing over \"I called first\" \"but I called *properly* first\".","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2017-04-18T18:19:37.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is actually super cool!
