Which makes sense in theory..\r\n\r\nBut _(speaking for myself)_ its not motivating when you get 6 fragments in a day, and then never see one for the next three weeks _(which was my april)_.\r\n\r\nWhy not just make them regular? So you still get the same amount of keys in a month, but have them more evenly spread. So you don&#039;t open 3 chests in the first week and then be bone dry until next month.\r\n\r\nNow that it&#039;s may and the cycle begins again, I&#039;ve only played like 3 games today and already got 2 fragments. So by the end of tomorrow ill have probably 2 chests opened, and then nada until June.\r\n\r\nMaybe its better this way for people who don&#039;t play much? I dont know. \r\nBut when you play as much as I do _(and I&#039;m sure a lot of you as well)_, you power through all the key fragments in a single day and then theres none left for aaaages. \r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n_(to be clear, I&#039;m not talking about the number of fragments to be increased, just for them to be a little more evenly spaced out)_","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-05-03T06:41:48.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The drop rate for key fragments is a curve, not a line.

It feels like after the first few days (which are loaded with keys), you have nothing left to look forward to.\n\nI dont suppose there can be a solution though, not without compromising the number of keys players with limited play time can earn.

However, it doesn't work because the rate at which players receive chests is not the same as the rate that players earn key shards, thus forcing the player to either spend money on the system or grind for keys, the exact thing you are trying to avoid!\n\nMaybe a better idea, would be that the rate a player recieves keys is constant (which is reasonably low), however when they earn a chest maybe the drop rate for keys increases over the next few games?","replies":[]},{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-05-03T07:02:37.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maraudaur,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=AGhKEVtp,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-05-03T06:41:48.953+0000)\n>\n> The drop rate for key fragments is a curve, not a line.
