A true marathon indeed.\nIt made its full 3 laps, from dragon pit, to turret before expiring. \n\nI wish it well in all its endeavours, but am left with the parting thought of: \n_&quot;WTF Just happened?&quot;_","replies":[{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2016-11-07T00:38:33.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"YAY SENTINEL!
