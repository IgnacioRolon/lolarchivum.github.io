Take Swain for example; the greatest tactitan in runeterra, whose only tactic is to sprout wings and run headlong into the enemy.\r\n\r\nBut should there be more lore in game? More high risk high reward interactions like Kha'Zix and Rengar. Some reason to purposefully pick (or not pick) allies/rivals of champs either your team or the enemy picks. To add an extra dynamic to the game.\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat do you reckon?","replies":[]}
