It is like Lee Sin, when he is ahead he appears to have it all, damage, sustain, tank stats but that's only because his build is complete 15+ minutes before it should be _because you let him get ahead_. Normally Lee is just keeping up with everyone else if they all hit full build at the same time.  He's rather mediocre if he doesn't play the get ahead game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrPine","date":"2015-09-06T03:13:50.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rengar is a normal assassin lol...","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-09-06T06:27:14.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"'Normal assassin' so by definition he shouldn't have sustained damage or tankiness.\nan assassins job is to jump in, kill the high priority targets and jump out because after using your burst you are vulnerable.\n\nnot only can rengar jump in and burst down the adc in under 2 seconds, he can then hang around as a busier for the remainder of the fight.\n\nimagine LB jumps into a fight, melts the adc and then turns into vladimir for the rest of the fight.. not so cool aye?","replies":[{"poster":"MrPine","date":"2015-09-06T06:40:01.154+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"lmfaoo LB is ap, compare Rengar to Zed, he goes in nukes adc and then life steals it all back up only difference is zed typically plays mid lane so your team doesn't lose anything but if you're going to play Rengar it's generally as top or jungle so your team loses out on a potential tank.
