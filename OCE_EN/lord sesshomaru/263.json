Even if you decided against it for some reason, you should really still keep us informed on your decision and why.  Thats the considerate thing to do, and only takes a few minutes of someone's time.\n\nCan anyone from this department shed some light?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-05T06:50:10.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Obviously not an official source, but it seems likely he's not problematic enough to gut, and they've gone through many iterations internally that just aren't working out. I can't imagine they want to Ryze it again, especially given that Yasuo's kit isn't actually all that bad, it's just that he's perceived by a lot of players as frustrating to play against.\n\nIt's also possible that the attitude has simply changed over time. I can say I personally don't see Yasuo banned basically ever anymore, but I've also climbed quite a bit higher in those 2 years.\n\nI do agree that Riot's communication isn't always the best or the clearest though.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-10-07T03:33:04.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just asking for followup.  They do this quite often, try to show us that they're 'open' by telling us what they are working on, but then fail to update us when they change their mind.\n\nPersonally, I still don't like Yasuo.  He's far far from being the worst champ in the game, but in my opinion he still gets too many things too easily.  For example his easy last hitting and clear speed are too good for a champ who has easy early access to kills.   And that his kit is just too smooth.  He gets 'hidden power' from things like his dashing, making him difficult to right click, so you end up clicking minions or issuing a movement command instead. Agreed dashing should be a counter to skill shots, and when you miss your laser because he dashed away, that's fair, he outplayed you, you deserve to die.  But when you lose a fight to him because you couldn't just _F*4w6ghing_ right click on him, thats when frustration sets in.\n\nSo personally I'm still open to him getting an ability update to add in more windows of 'oh look I can actually attack him now', even if that means buffing his strengths.  But mostly I'm just after Riot following up on the things they promise, even if it's as simple as \"Yea it didn't work, we aren't doing that anymore.\"","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-10-08T02:30:38.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree in many aspects. Yasuo always has and always will be one of the strongest champs in the game. \nHow-ever, to you're point about dashing. Only his dash to you cannot be dodged. His q and e can be dodged quite easily. Furthermore, just like any other champion his abilities have cool downs. If you're smart you can lure him in just the same as he does when he has low health but people forget his shield. Wait for him to burn his e and dash to you, lure him away from the wave and he has nothing left to defend himself. I know it's easy to say but I'm just saying, if you're smart there are ways around his kit.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-10-08T13:30:39.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His dash is his E, and his dash can be 'dodged' by using a dash/flash of your own to move out of the set distance of his dash. Hmmm Good luck dodging his Q!  Maybe the hurricane can be dodged, but the other casts are instant, and AoE, I personally don't have the capability of dodging those, especially if he isn't using them predictively.\n\nYes, Yasuo has cooldowns.  His Q is 1.33 seconds, while his dash is 0.1 seconds, his ult has a cooldown of 30 seconds _(one of the lowest ultimate cooldowns in the game)_.  So yes, he does technically have cooldowns, the issue is that his cooldowns are just a lot shorter than whoever you happen to be playing against him.  especially seeing as he is a mid laner, and most mid laners rely on big heavy hitting skillshot abilities with long cooldowns.  He just has less windows of vulnerability than other champs.  His windwall is basically a bonus, he functions very well without it, much better than other champions do without their 'fallback defence ability'.\n\nOh yea I agree, there are ways around everyone's kit, you just have to play right.  But personally I believe there are less ways _(or at least the ways are harder to consistently pull off) _than the majority of other champs.\n\nBut my main point here is to ask riot to follow through when they post things like this.  Either update him, or tell us why they didn't, either one is fine.  It'd just be nice to have followup on not just this issue, but many like it.","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-10-09T02:26:53.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">\n> His dash is his E, and his dash can be 'dodged' \n\nYes that's what I meant and I did say in my post all his abilities are skill shots which can be dodged accept for when he dashes on you and e's. Sorry I'm not a Yasuo player and I know how to play against him not how to play with him.\n\n>. Hmmm Good luck dodging his Q!  Maybe the hurricane can be dodged, but the other casts are instant, and AoE, I personally don't have the capability of dodging those, especially if he isn't using them predictively.\n\nHis Q is the same as any other skill shot. Obviously it's not easy to dodge because when he uses it he is on top of you but I have dodged it many times and if you have picked up on the timing of the player you should know when it's coming. Maybe sometimes dps or fps might factor in to if a Yas player hits his abilities or not but I still believe at the end of the day they are all just skill shots.\n\n> Yes, Yasuo has cooldowns.

How-ever I think he does have a high skill cap not for execution but more macro based. Yasuo the streamer is the perfect example of an exception to the rule because he uses all execution variables perfectly. \n\n>He just has less windows of vulnerability than other champs.

Also just for that alone you would probably need a crew of a few people to look after keeping track of forum/general champion requests and relaying info and updates back and forth.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-10-08T19:31:42.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol just delete yasuo. champ can be 0/10 in lane, get three items, and be 10/11 five minutes later.","replies":[]}]}
