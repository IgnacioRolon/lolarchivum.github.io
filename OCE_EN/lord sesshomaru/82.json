A Magic resist item that reduces Attack Speed, there are a few champs now that this could help defend against, e.g.. Azir, Teemo, kayle etc all of which are really strong and don&#039;t have items that counter them as well as other champs do. \r\nit would also be useful in situations where the enemy team has lots of AP but also a Fed Yi and you already have a thornmail and want frozen heart&#039;s AS reduction passive but because of Yi&#039;s true damage and the teams lots of AP you don&#039;t really want 200+ armour in items, so this item would provide the passive and some MR.\r\n\r\n2. Annie&#039;s Passive stun when used on her Q only activates if the Q hits the enemy, if you Zhyonyas or use Yasuo&#039;s wind wall to stop it mid flight, the stun stack is not consumed and she can stun you with the next spell, this provides very little counterplay, and id like to see it that regardless of wether it hits or not the stun is still consumed (like her other abilities) right now you only option is to take the stun straight in the face or hope to god that she uses E and you manage to dodge it. \r\n\r\n3. An AP move-through-units item, right now the unit collision is terrible, you can walk though a line of minions, and then when you try to get back out again your champ decides to walk all the way around, that and other similar situations have killed me and so many others quite a few times. Phantom dancer provides this for ADC&#039;s and for tanks/fighters its not so necessary because perfect positioning isn&#039;t key to their fighting style, plus they have the health/resistances to deal with that, but poor AP champs who are often just as squishy as the ADC and require good positioning, struggle heaps with tho problem, so a good AP item that removes Unit collision would be really beneficial. \r\n\r\n4. not quite a counterplay thing more of a quality of life, but we all know the feeling of flashing out of something thats dealing damage to you, only to die straight after your flash to the thing you just flashed out of, for example rumble&#039;s ultimate, you think you can make it out by walking and you get to the edge and realise you cant and you flash and the animation of the flash happens and your champ ends up out of the ability and then you die (and you check and he doesnt have any DoT items and no minions AA you) you&#039;re dead and have no flash, and its not really fair, if you did die then your flash shouldn&#039;t work, but if you did flash out of the ability the damage that killed you shouldnt apply because you aren&#039;t standing in it anymore. so i think something could be done about that.","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-07-17T04:54:08.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. banshee's veil + Frozen Heart =  profit???\n2. A bug? nah but fk annie.\n3. Hmm this is interesting but I can't see it happening, ADCs get Phantom Dancer because they need it, AP has a rich enough itemisation as it is.\n4. Not sure I follow this, youre saying if you flash out of a Rumble ult and the DoT kills you then flash should not go off? or are you saying if you get killed by something right as you flash, flash still goes off and you die right after. Scenario A would be a hell no, if you flash out of a Rumble ult thats going to kill you then you dont deserve a refund, that was your choice, on the other hand if you flash, say, away from a melee champ who's mid auto, you flash away but the auto still kills you then i feel you are somewhat entitled to a reduced cooldown.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-07-17T07:31:32.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rumbles ult is only DoT if you stand in it, so theoretically it is impossible to die from it when your champion is not standing in it, yet it is possible to flash out but die where you flashed, when that shouldn't be the case.\n\nand yes if you flash away from a melee attack and it kills you that is bs and you deserve your flash back","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-07-17T08:19:33.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually the DoT lingers after you leave it, it just reapplies every tick while you stand in it.\n\nSource: former Rumble main.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-07-17T09:07:18.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont know if it does that or not, but judging from what the ability actually says, it shouldn't be doing that\nits not like cassiopia's cloud which is DoT damage even after you leave the area.","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-07-17T11:36:25.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as someone who follows pro play and has witnessed countless Rumble picks I can assure you Rumble's ult is working as intended.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-07-17T11:54:35.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seeing a bug in pro play doesn't make it not a bug, remember that the pro's use exactly the same game we do, if something doesn't perform right, it doesn't matter in the slightest whether its a lvl 1 or a challenger pro using it, its still wrong. if rumbles ult deals DPS to people standing in the ult, they should not take damage at any point after they have exited the AoE area. if it is dealing damage to people AFTER they have exited the area for any reason then it isn't working as intended.\n\nremember it deals X damage 'per' 1 second not 'over' 1 second.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-07-17T05:24:24.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. this would be a good item to introduce \n\n2. yeah it should get used up if it's blocked like zeds ult it needs some counter play\n\n3. they should take 2% movespeed off ludens and add that instead or lich bane\n\n4. yeah it's stupid if you die within 0.1 of flashing from something that's not a Dot or an aa it should refresh or at least halve the time","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-07-17T05:01:11.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Seems extremely specific counter to certain champions. The reason i'd say this would never happen though, is for those teamcomps that have 3 AP's and an ADC. Imagine building MR while at the same time reducing the enemy ADC's attack speed as a bonus. I guess another Spectres Cowl option wouldn't hurt though.\n\n2. Fair enough.\n\n3. I think this should just be an \"enchantment\" option for boots honestly. Like add this passive to alacrity or captain boots or something.\n\n4. Learn not to flash. Granted it doesn't matter how often you play or how high your rank is, people still do things like this but it's a part of the game. Knowing when to not \"waste cooldowns\" and accept the death.","replies":[]}]}
