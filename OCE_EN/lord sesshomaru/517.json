If you have the higher MMR you will get normal LP gains.\n\nYour friend will gain normal LP gains until his MMR is above his rank division rank. Which should be a couple wins at a higher level of play.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-25T12:00:39.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HOWEVER, you are also expected to win the game at different rates that effect your MMR's.\n\nHe is playing in higher level games, you are playing in lower level games and your MMR gain's and losses are modified as such.","replies":[]}]}]}
