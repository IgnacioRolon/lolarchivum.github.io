Either that, or extreme laziness that will cost innocent players who aren&#039;t as aware of it.\r\n\r\ni have played League of Legends since the end of 2012 and love the game and being a part of the lol community, and i support riot in most things, but this is just plain wrong, and I&#039;m disappointed that they would take advantage of their trusting player base like this.\r\n\r\nit isn&#039;t illegal, and in the merch store there is a US$ sign in the corner, but it is still a sneaky move to catch players unawares, and has affected my view of their &#039;most player friendly company&#039; values.\r\n(even Apple tries to change the currency to be not even region but COUNTRY specific, and they unlike RIOT aren&#039;t known for their customer consideration)\r\n\r\nHowever like all good hypocrites i still bought my figures even though i knew they were in USD and i will continue to purchase RP unhindered.","replies":[{"poster":"Alex Manisier","date":"2015-11-30T22:53:46.276+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Lord Sesshomaru,\n\nPlease believe me when I say that I'm really sorry, and that we're not trying to be deceptive or rip you off at all. If there was any confusion regarding prices, it wasn't because we tried to be sneaky - it's because we messed up. \n\nIf you check http://oce.leagueoflegends.com right now, you'll notice that the subline for the figure fest sale specifies that the prices are in US dollars. However, that subline doesn't appear in the client. So if you never went to the website, you probably wouldn't have picked up on it beforehand. That's my bad - I should have made it clear even for people clicking through from the client.\n\nIt's true that the site currently doesn't have an AUD/NZD option. Currently, there are difficulties displaying those prices since they're subject to exchange rates. We can nail those prices down once we find a way to make getting merch easier for everyone in OCE, but as it stands, we need to display them in USD.\n\nAgain, I'm sorry you had a negative experience with the figure sale. I know it might not mean much, but we're working on ways to make merch a less painful experience for everyone. In the meantime, I recommend you [check out this post](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/L4eGcnT7-merchandising-store-update) from MasterMirkinen for full context on the USD pricing + some questions asked by other players.\n\nThanks for giving us this feedback - it's what helps us improve!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-11-30T23:56:23.648+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Riot Manisier \n\nThank you for saying this, you have fully restored my faith in RIOT :)\n\nit wasn't a huge issue for me personally, my only concern is that people (especially students) who want some merch might allow for it in their budget  but not realising the US dollar price might spend that extra money unknowingly, and then later on when they need it it isn't there. \nbut i do fully understand the difficulties of exchange rates and website coding issues. \n\nthank you again for saying this, it means a lot and I'm glad that RIOT still cares this much about their players ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Alex Manisier","date":"2015-12-01T04:50:22.298+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's really cool of you to flag this issue for other players even if it doesn't affect you directly!\n\nThanks for being patient and forgiving with us :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
