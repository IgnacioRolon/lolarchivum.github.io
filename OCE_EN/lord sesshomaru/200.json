I hate when little things like champ voice lines/animations/particles/the server disappear for seemingly no reason. I'll ask around and see if this is a known issue and if it's OCE only. Do you have a source on it being due to Emotes? I might be out of the loop on that.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-09-18T22:16:41.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does that mean it might be a bug and not intentional?\nThat would make my day!\n\nNo I don't have a source, it's just what other players have been talking about in game.
