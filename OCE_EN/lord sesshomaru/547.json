Truly, they do amazing work!\nBut we see a lot of talk in ask riots and /dev etc. \n_&quot;We don&#039;t pick a champ and say &#039;they haven&#039;t had a skin for a while&#039; and make them a skin. We think of cool themes and turn them into skins for champs that we think work well with that theme.&quot;_ \n\nSo, you&#039;re telling me that out of 150+ champs, Jarvan was the absolute next best fit you could think of for the Dark Star theme?\nNo one in the whole skins team could think of a single champion that was a batter fit?\n\nNot Kench, who literally swallows everything.\nNot Fiddlesticks, who drains the life from people.\nNot Bard, who makes otherworldly wormholes through terrain, and stops time.\nNot Veigar, whose entire kit is themes around black holes.\n\nBut Jarvan.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \n\nWhat about Viktor, with his AoE pull-into-the-centre, or his circular ball of destruction floating in his ult. Even Viktor's mentality of 'turning everyone into something greater' matches Dark Star Thresh's theme of of being almost religious about the black hole.\n\nMeanwhile I can't think of a single thing that likens Jarvan to the Dark Star, his ult and flag actually create things, not destroy them. How was Jarvan considered a better choice than Viktor or any of the others? Like really?\n\nThis rattles my faith somewhat in the process you keep telling us is the way you decide who gets a skin..","replies":[{"poster":"DarkSoul1994","date":"2018-03-03T02:22:52.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can honestly agree with this. I appreciate that Riot finally gave Jarvan a skin (I feel like the last non-esports skin he got was Warring Kingdoms back in 2013).\n\nI got the skin, I like the skin, but there were certainly far better candidates.\n\nEDIT: I think J4 would have been a pretty good candidate for Mecha Skin. He'd make for a great Kaiju-killing mofo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2018-03-02T23:21:12.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they mean the look of the skin and how the VFX work with the champions abilities, not the actual theme of the skin matching with that champions lore and backstory.\n\nPlus Jarvan needed a decent skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-03-03T02:17:42.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the only ability or vfx jarvan has that is remotely 'dark star' themed is his ult (which I can only imagine as being visually quite distracting and a competitive balance issue, if they did apply this theme).\n\nAlso what about Aurelion? he has that one trashy albino skin and that's about it. Also I'd say that whilst Jarvan doesn't have any amazing skins, he's got about 2 mediocre ones (and admittedly alot of bad ones), but overall he's not hurting as bad as some other champions in the skin department.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-03-02T01:14:20.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dark Star Syndra, Dark Star Aurelion Sol, Dark Star Zoe.
