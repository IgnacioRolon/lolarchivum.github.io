And thats not going to change, so they will just keep accruing more and more skins.  While champs with more interesting and specific designs, who because of that don't fit such a wide variety of skin lines, will forever be by the wayside. \nSo where do we draw the line here?","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-05-01T04:14:51.019+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"graves is a far better magical girl than Tailyah.
