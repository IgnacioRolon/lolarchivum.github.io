NOt sure if he is fixed, and even if he was people might not want to bother picking him in case they have to remake due to the bug.\n\nHe has been banned twice. Once by Samsung against Splyce and once by G2 against CLG.\n\nAzir and Taliyah are no shows right now. Its mainly Syndra/Cass/Ori mids.\n\nPeople like stats. Some friendly people have given you all you want here. Nidalee 100% pick or ban so far.\n\nhttp://lol.gamepedia.com/2016_World_Championship/Champion_Statistics\n\nEDIT: CLG just picked Aurelion vs ROX.\nFW picked Aurelion vs SKT.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-10-03T11:22:32.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhh ok thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-10-04T07:50:34.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Azir was banned in the EDG vs H2K game actually, i think that was on day four if i can remember correctly","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2016-10-02T23:10:54.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aurelion sol has been getting disabled a bit due to some bugs with his W being misrepresented on the map.
