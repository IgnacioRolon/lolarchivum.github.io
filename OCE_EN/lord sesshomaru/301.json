If you have some experience on her you can dominate melee picks with range and constant harass, you also have enough mobility to juke when things get ugly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2015-12-06T13:22:56.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play nothing but ap, and my winrate is slowly going up this patch.\n\nJust play bursty champs that have dps aswell, so for example i play alot of kayle and akali both of which have high burst but can still auto you down.","replies":[]}]}
