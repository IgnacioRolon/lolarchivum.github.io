But you aren&#039;t very good at **keeping** us in the loop, especially when plans change.\n\nAo Shin, Magma Chamber, etc. all we hear is: \n_&quot;Look here, there is going to be this amazing new thing! look forward to it!&quot;_\nThen a few years later we get the: \n_&quot;Oh that? yea we scrapped that yonks ago!&quot;_\n\nMeanwhile the community is kept in the dark, holding out for this promised thing, not sure when or even if it is coming.\n\nbefore season 7 started, you said that early in the season we would hear more about an alleged Aurelion Sol rework. The season has ended now and all the Aurelion Sol players are still sitting here months and months later thinking _&quot;Is... is, our favourite champ going to be changed or not?&quot;_\n\nEarlier you promised a Yasuo rework, around the same time you announced Azir&#039;s, Azir&#039;s rework has come and gone now, and not a peep have we heard on Yasuo&#039;s one. Meanwhile Yas players still can&#039;t play draft pick, and non-yasuo players still can&#039;t play blind pick.\n\nWhat seems to be the vast majority of us are unhappy with the current state of the game and many of the meta and pre-season changes. But _(to my knowledge at least)_ we haven&#039;t heard anything addressing or even acknowledging our concerns. Except for pinning some token blue essence onto the first win of the day.\n\n______________\n\nSo in future, could you please spend a little bit of time just to keep us up-to-date on a few of the things you casually mention in Ask Riot and media statements?\n\n_&quot;Yes we said we would look at nerfing Duskblade. but now we don&#039;t think it&#039;s necessary.&quot;_\n_&quot;A while ago, we mentioned an Aatrox rework, don&#039;t worry that is still on the way.&quot;_\n_&quot;We know the current meta is in flux and is unpleasant for some, but we want to let it settle first, before actively inciting change.&quot;_\n_&quot;Update: We decided to scrap Aurelion Sol&#039;s rework. we cant force-fit every champ to every meta.&quot;_\n\nMaybe just like a little pinned boards blog or something, that maybe updates monthly?\nIs it really that hard to once a month just say _&quot;Yep, there is still someone working on Aatrox.&quot;_\nLittle things like that could save players so much grief and uncertainty.","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2018-01-02T23:41:44.372+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, i agree with you here because I haven't heard anything lately about stuff they talked about such as Aurelion and Yasuo rework. Tbh i would look forward to the mini yasuo rework like maybe changing one of his abilities becase imo he either gets destroyed or pops off so I would like to see a yasuo mini rework. But it does annoy me that they say that and never speak again about it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-01-03T05:26:29.580+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"LoL is now in caretaker money raker mode. The original developers have driven off in their bentleys and accountants now run the show. Hence the lack of interest in the community, the reliance on bots, and the player $ farming changes to IP and BE.\n\nThis isnt paranoia, it is legit what is happening if you can be bothered joining the dots of key people leaving, sale of company to tencent, and broken punishment system.\n\nThe game's management has changed hands - it used to be driven by passionate folks who developed the game because it was an awesome game. Now it is driven by executives who want a return on their investment and the best way to do that is to jack up the $ they farm from their players and cut costs at their end.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-01-03T04:52:51.645+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Let's not forget the Tribunal. I mean, it was announced back in season 4 that it was being taken down \"temporarily\" while the overall system is upgraded, and while there have been some advances in certain areas (for example the Instant Feedback System), still no word on the Tribunal itself. Not a single update.\n\nThat said, I honestly don't think a Tribunal-like system would work effectively, but that's another issue entirely. The point is, Riot hasn't told the community *anything* about what's actually happening with the Tribunal, even if they've just decided to scrap the concept.\n\nWe've needed an update for about 3 years now, so where is it?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2018-01-03T14:52:35.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We heard rather early that Magma Chamber was scrapped, Riot outright told us \"it is very glitchy and we can't fix any of the bugs within reasonable time frame\".\nThat went under the radar for most players somehow, probably because Magma Chamber itself was a meme from the moment it was originally mentioned and the meme drowned out everything Riot said on it's cancellation.\nIt took like 2-3 years before people actually believed it was canceled.\nI would not consider this Riot's fault. Pure community issue here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2018-01-03T00:18:51.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIP Magma Chamber.","replies":[]}]}
