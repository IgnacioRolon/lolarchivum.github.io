That would be great! :)\r\n\r\nRiot Axes said that in at least few patches they would have something to show. So i&#039;ve been watching the PBE every day for 3 months now. \r\nand nothing. Every patch day I wait with baited breath, hoping to god they haven&#039;t ruined one of the best designed champs in the game.\r\n\r\nHistorically, Riot is very good at announcing their intentions when they have an idea, however they aren&#039;t so good at conveying when they scrap said ideas later down the track. So we all still end up waiting for something that is never coming.\r\n\r\nAre these Sol changes still in the works or not?\r\nIts been over double the amount of time Axes said they would likely have something to show, so I&#039;m starting to wonder... and hope.\r\n\r\nIf they are cancelled _(and I hope they are)_, I would rather know now, be saved the suspense of waking up and running straight to the PBE changes every morning.\r\n\r\nIf someone in the know could shed some light that would be fantastic ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-04-04T22:53:01.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Found this for you - https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/tcjKBREI-quick-gameplay-thoughts-march-30\n\n> Aurelion Sol\n> \n> Apologies if I've mentioned this before and forgotten, been seeing some questions about it still. After testing a few different directions we concluded that a mini update on Aurelion Sol wasn't something we thought we should do, at least not in the short to medium term. He's still got a couple of issues we'd like to improve at some point (play and counterplay around star use, Q satisfaction). The possible changes we were testing didn't work out as well as we'd hoped in game though, creating an experience that wasn't more appealing for people who weren't already interested in playing Aurelion Sol and was often felt as worse for those who already play Aurelion Sol. We've cut that work off as a result and are putting the time into other projects that look likely to give more game improvement for the hours spent.","replies":[]}]}
