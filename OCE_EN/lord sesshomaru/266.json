Starsurge is not performing as intend.\n\n2. The champion reveal page is wrong.\n\nSo with respect to your &#039;clarity&#039; Riot, could you please not leave us in the dark as to which thing is wrong? Is Starsurge bugged, or is the champion reveal page misleading?\n\nthanks\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-04-07T03:31:53.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"page is wrong, that said something alone the lines of \"there has to be a delay so he is vulnerable when they get into melee range\" or something, because that is his \"weakness\" and the double tap stun removes that vulnerability.
