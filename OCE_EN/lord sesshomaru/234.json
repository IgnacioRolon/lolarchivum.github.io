It's a work in progress. Sure smite buffs made the jungle more interesting, but they had little to no impact past laning phase. Gromp and Wolf being the notable exceptions, Gromp didn't scale well and Wolf was replaced with the scrying plants which actually do a better more consistent job since they clear vision as well.\n\n_Skins_ come down to the creative process. Creating a skin for Teemo/Ezreal doesn't mean some other champion is missing out, it just means that skin is what made it through the vetting process first. Remember that skins are primarily _art_, and therefore are not something you can put accurate timelines or schedules on.\n\n_The one game_ served pretty much the same function as the 10, since we already had a rank to base it off of (namely our solo/duo). Having another 10 game placements would have caused the people who spent hours playing ranked in flex much more grief, for an overall small difference. Riot did the reset in the least painful way they could.\n\n_They haven't changed everything_ though, and past that, the game has to evolve or it will die. If it was still the exact same game as 10 years ago, noone would be playing it.\n\n_He wasn't banned for playing Singed support_. He was banned for picking 'support' and then going jungle, abandoning his adc and his entire team and roaming the enemy jungle.\n\nWhen an off meta pick like _Brand support_ takes off of course they are going to encourage it, same as Zyra support. They want to encourage this kind of play, but they also have to be careful not to encourage people to be assholes in ranked because they think they can't be banned for it.\n\n___\nRiot heard the community when they said they wanted item sets back, but that doesn't mean they can be top priority when things like spectate, RGM and other big features have yet to be implemented as well.\n\nIt's worth remembering you have one perspective, I have another, and Riot's is different again. Riot also has actual data and statistics to back up their perspective. It's also worth remembering that here on boards noone has all the information, so everything not said by Riot themselves should be taken with a healthy grain of scepticism. It's ALSO worth remembering that just because you can't see why Riot has done something, doesn't mean you should immediately be an ass about it, rather you could consider asking why they have done so first, and plenty of people would be willing to give you their answers.","replies":[{"poster":"Wess","date":"2016-11-16T21:49:42.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=v76ZsQf2,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-11-16T01:12:41.801+0000)\n>\n> _Item sets_ are not being taken away, they just haven&#x27;t been implemented yet: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/230175788-Updated-Client-Open-Beta-FAQ#h2q1\n> \nThank god for that, I still have my item sets appearing in game and thought it was a bug.

Maybe they'll stop playing bloody ranked then, and stop causing other players to lose LP because they are too heavy to carry, and they'll stick to norms until they get their confidence back by getting better at the damn game. \nWin-win-win!!\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} \nhuehuehue","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Somebody not you","date":"2016-11-16T21:22:05.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> throw a random dart that hits a bullseye, would it be fair for you to be ranked up with the professional players just because a random chance got you a bullseye?\n\n\n\nNo, people threw 10 random darts and they were trying really hard to hit the bullseye. If they get enough bullseyes then yeah, they deserve a higher spot. \nAnd then Riot made them throw another single dart that redetermined it all.\n\nMost people, like myself, probably didn't realise that Flex Queue was broken af before it was announced as such. \n\nI didn't know there was an actual issue but figured something was wrong because of the huge disparity in the rankings of the players I was seeing in my own games. But I actually enjoyed it. A lot. As someone who has more game knowledge than skill, obviously because I'm still bronze, it was nice for once to have people other than just myself on my team that understood the importance of objectives and didn't just spend all game randomly chasing the enemy through unwarded jungle all game while leaving lanes, dragon and Baron untouched with the minions getting most of the towers. \n\nThat would have to be my #1 peeve in game; idiots chasing the enemy like coyotes after cats while ignoring the rewards of 4 dragons, 6 towers and a Baron buff or two.\n\nKills wins games!\n\nYeah, right.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-11-16T03:44:11.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well its hard to argue with a lot of your points.\n\nBut while i haven't done the best job of illustrating them, or selecting the best examples, there are a lot of decisions that riot makes, that the majority of the player base finds problems with, and ultimately in the end, riot ends up reverting them. (or worse, just ignoring them)\nso you know what i mean.\n\nI never go into an argument being that ass that never considers why the other party did what they did, I always think about it, but some things are still wrong, even though they have a reason.\n\nand Lee sin is on the list because no Tank should have assassin level damage (or vice versa, whichever class you want to put that champ into)\nhe has too much (highest base move speed, Q is up 3 times in a fight, no mana, ult has too much damage for the CC it provides... the list goes on and on.) and there being 2 of them in every game only magnifies the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-16T06:51:12.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I must apologise, after answering so very many posts about the flex drama I was rather at the end of my string, and so I was definitely more aggressive in my post than I should have been, so apologies for that. \n\nI don't entirely disagree with you, there are things that get done that even with a limited inside look I cannot fathom the reasoning for, though it usually comes down to numbers and stats that we don't see as players (which I must admit, are something I wish we saw a lot more of).\n\nThe best example for a change they reverted/altered I can think of would be dyna queue. Personally, I don't feel it was a mistake to introduce dyna queue. My perspective is that it's a team game, and thus having a team is a mechanic of the game that you would learn and improve on like any other mechanic, so I felt the perceived disadvantage that solo players faced was the same as maybe building a less effective item on x champion or such. I can't honestly say I don't still feel that way, having said that though, having talked extensively to some of the other volunteers who are on the other side I started to understand the desire for a solo or solo/duo queue.\n\nIf it came down to picking one, I'd still say dyna/flex, which is why I don't disagree with that initial decision (though there perhaps should have been an interim warm up period), but I do see the other side of things now. Whether or not OCE can support two ranked queues remains to be seen :P\n\nSome reasons are more valid to some people than others, and some are universally no good. With a game as diverse as League, you're never going to please everyone :P It's hard to tell just from places like boards, since those who are happy with the state of things are much less likely to come and say \"hey, I like this\" than those that are unhappy and come to say \"hey, I don't like this\".\n\nI can't disagree with you about Lee Sin really. Perhaps I wouldn't go quite as far as you in my hatred, but he's certainly high on my ban list these days. I feel if his ult didn't get the extra damage for hitting more than one person, and either his base move speed or Q range was dropped a little he'd be in an alright spot. He's one of those champions whose impact varies wildly between levels of play so he's difficult to balance for.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
