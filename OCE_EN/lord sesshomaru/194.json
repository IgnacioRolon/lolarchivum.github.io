Your champion has to path round entire waves often when there are blatant gaps between the minions _(gaps sometimes wide enough for Blitz Pulls to still get you)_.\r\n\r\nand this situation really takes the cake.\r\n_(i was spamming move commands, and Sol just couldn&#039;t budge for a solid 4 or 5 seconds.)_\r\n\r\nFor a champion whose entire source of damage relies on moving around, this was extremely debilitating, and caused me to enter the battle quite a few seconds late. Had I not been completely snared I could have either Killed or scared off Vayne, and Shen would have lived _(which could have been vital seeming we had an AFK, and every life counts)_, as well as slowed down Rakan so he would be late and more hesitant to enter the battle.\r\n\r\nRiot doesn&#039;t seem too bothered about unit collision atm. They at least haven&#039;t mentioned it, or any plans of changing it that I have seen. Which makes me think that this is working as intended.\r\n\r\n_______\r\n\r\nSo Id like to know, officially:\r\nIs this working as intended?\r\n\r\nIf so:\r\nWhy is this behaviour intentional?\r\n\r\nIf not:\r\nWhen/what plans are there to change it? \r\n\r\n\r\nAlso if people have any other stories/vids it&#039;d be interesting to see them. ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-04-29T08:51:23.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Had it happen about 5 times last Thursday/Friday while trying out Xayah in Coop VS AI.
