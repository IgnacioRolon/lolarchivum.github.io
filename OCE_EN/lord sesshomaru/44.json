(Not insulting, just clarifying).\n\nBtw this could actually make a really good separate gamemode if you removed the rewards for winning challenges and replaced it with buffs, or gold, or items.\n\nAnd instead of been issued by players the AI would start challenges. It actually sounds really fun, and would make it pretty interesting especially for the current RGMs.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-21T11:04:16.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I count many people would buy it just for this, but cocky players who need to prove to everyone that they are the worlds best Yasuo, will get caught up in the moment and spend what they already have I'm sure. \n\nYoure right you know, that would make an epic game mode! we should suggest it.","replies":[]}]}]}
