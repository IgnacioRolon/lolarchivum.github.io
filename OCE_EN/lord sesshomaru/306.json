It will have an early sale where it drops to 975 RP fairly soon I believe (roughly 2 months), but the normal 50% off sale shouldn't be for almost another year.\n\nI find [this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T5h1LKTRCVg3NU9XA3NSlrGS1dF5YO6KfEePIL893SU/) is fairly handy for predicting sales. It's usually accurate to within a few weeks.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-22T04:16:48.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh ok thanks :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-08-22T04:11:35.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Skins typically go on early sale ~6 months after release. Skins that are part of a series, like Super Galaxy, have their early sales spread out with one per month. An example is the Beast Hunter skins, they were released in Feb and went on early sale one at a time in June, July, and August.\n\nSooo, while I don't know when we might have SG Shyvana go on early sale, as it was released at the end of May I would predict it to happen in October, November or December.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-22T04:16:14.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah ok thank you, i didn't know about the spread out part of the sale. Thats perfect news, i shall get him some other skins instead for his bday, and he can get shyv later on in the year, thanks heaps :)","replies":[]}]}]}
