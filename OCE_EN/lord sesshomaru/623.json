As soon as he presses it again, he dashes. As soon as his dash lands he is free to move/use abilities. As soon as he presses W, he&#039;s moving. As soon as he press E he slams the ground instantly, as soon as he presses R, it happens. \nEven his auto attacks are quick, instead of having a big swing like karthus, Nautilus or Camille, as soon as he clicks-BAM! cooldown.... BAM! cooldown... BAM!\n\nChamps like Kayn with his Q, have to perform the ability, and then when it lands, sit and wait for the animation to complete before having access to his tools again.  Shaco has a little wiggle in-between pressing R and it activating, Ezreal has the same with his E.  Aatrox&#039;s E doesn&#039;t cast immediately upon pressing the button, he has to raise his sword up first. All of these little things mean that these champs get access to their damage or escapes, slightly late.  Lee has none of this, you press the button and the ability is instantly active.\n\nAll those times where you&#039;re Ezreal and you E away, but Amumu&#039;s Q catches you in your animation and jumps all the way to you. Lee gets none of that.\n\nHe also has no lockout, he can doubletap Q, cast R the instant his W lands, land his E the micro-second that his Q dash lands.\nMeanwhile Aurelion Sol has to wait before re-activating his Q, Kayn is locked out of all actions while the second part of his Q is animation. Even Riven has to use special animation canceling techniques to gain back these little moments. \n\nTwo players lets say Lee and Aatrox, can fight each other, both players have the same reaction time.  But Aatrox&#039;s auto attacks have a bigger swing-time, so he wastes a couple of miliseconds on that, his ult takes a little bit to become active, his E has a slight delay, and his Q obviously takes much longer to get off the ground.  Meanwhile Lee doesn&#039;t even have to wait for one ability to finish before activating the next, he can cast W while mid Q flight....\n\nSo even though the players have the same reaction speeds, Lee does everything before Aatrox can, and so inevitably ends up making the winning plays before Aatrox.\n\n\n_______\n\nThis is what I think people find very frustrating when playing against Lee, no matter what you do, he always seems to be able to do his bit first.\nHis abilities take less time to throw, he recovers from his dashes more quickly, he dodges quicker because his dashes don&#039;t have cast times. it&#039;s just so frustrating to fight against.\n\nWhy does he not have to wait like 0.5 seconds before reactivating Q or something? Everyone else seems to.  LB for example, she can&#039;t doubletap W anymore, theres a little lockout time between when she lands and when she can cast it again to return.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-07-22T15:06:20.237+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always thought it was because lee has a kit comprised of 2 dashes, an execute, a shield, a knockback, a slow, life steal/spell vamp, and 2 abilities which grant true sight of a target.

His kits give him lots of mobility to outplay his oppent. However there is also counter play vsing lee's kit. For example, Gragas E can interupt Q mid air, same with reksai unburrow. Lee's Q has travel time, so when it connect, it make no sense to have it wait for another cool down. \n\nLee is blance right now, there are many jgler stronger than him out there in this meta. His strong point has always been the use of R; and his kits make it so he can do his R trick. If he is nerft he would be too weak compare to the other jgler, Zac, sej, rek, elise etc..","replies":[]}]}
