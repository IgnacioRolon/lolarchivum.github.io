So i vote we remove it from ranked to stop idiots who cant read the &#039;stay in bronze&#039; written over the surrender button, pressing it.\r\n\r\nthat is all.","replies":[{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2016-04-11T01:41:57.586+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"lmao I surrender like 25% of my games and I still managed to get gold.\nsaying shit like \"surrendering is what keeps you in bronze\" is what keeps you in bronze.\nalso being a trashlord.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Malcolm Trumble","date":"2016-04-11T09:31:57.329+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The surrender button lets you abandon a hopeless game, so you can go back into matchmaking to find another game.\nThat 'stay in bronze' button might save you a good 20 minutes of your time, in which you can go and win a game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"andyMak","date":"2016-04-11T01:24:02.230+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nah","replies":[]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-04-13T01:09:02.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot will never delete the surrender button in ranked, because it is the only way to ensure a loss. I noticed you logged onto your smurf to post this because you realized how dumb it sounds. Not only does it let a team abandon a pointless waste of time in the end sometimes, (which I never do) but it actually is used by the pros to keep themselves in low ELO on stream. They will play well, not intentionally feed but actually wreck so it is entertaining, and then surrender so they don't climb. Surrendering isn't against the rules, but intent feeding is. So yeah, if Riot has any smarts at all they would keep the surrender button.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lil Udyr Vert","date":"2016-04-12T06:34:27.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Scoreboard: 50 v 2 \n\"no dont surrender we can still win this!1!!11!1\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Im a CAT","date":"2016-04-11T23:50:05.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please don't remove the surrender button then I can't enjoy the pleasure of a player spamming surrender in ranked anymore like every 3 minutes or something :'( \n\nAnyways the surrender option can be annoying if a player rages and just keep spamming it HOWEVER sometimes you get one of those games where its unwinnable and you just want to be let free from a tilt game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wohltat","date":"2016-04-11T23:35:42.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"EU-West totally agrees.
