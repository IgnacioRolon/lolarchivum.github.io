He deals crazy amounts of burst damage, and has decent sustained damage too, with a true damage execute ult. AND also has ridiculous CC, not only does he have a aoe knock up but his knock up after its finished slows you so much you basically walk backwards, for a lengthy amount of time, and he has a silence that lasts waaaay too long. \r\ni just don&#039;t get why he needs so much?\r\n\r\nin my opinion if you&#039;re a tank you should have lots of HP/resistances and good lane sustain, also engage or support type abilities which usually involve hard CC, but the trade off is that you lack damage, like Leona or Braum. \r\nand if you&#039;re a Mage you should have Lots of damage, and soft CC, (occasionally hard CC) but the trade off is that you are squishy and lack lane sustain.\r\n\r\nwhy does cho have everything?\r\n\r\neverything has their counter, ADC&#039;s are countered by Assassins and mages, Assassins and mages are countered by tanks, and tanks are countered by ADC&#039;s, Yet cho can QWR assassinate an adc in under a second and not only save himself and get a kill but get even tanker.\r\n\r\nIm not moaning about him and saying he&#039;s unbeatable etc etc because obviously he isn&#039;t. But he does have a lot that isn&#039;t needed  for him to be powerful\r\nfor example the slow on his Q is just unnecessary, if you&#039;re a squishy and get hit by Q its basically a death sentence, and because he is a tank, that shouldnt be the case.\r\n\r\nThis isn&#039;t a &quot;wahhhh i just lost a game cos a fed cho killed me&quot; post, i haven&#039;t even played against him for a while, but that doesn&#039;t change what i think of him.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-10-10T03:09:09.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cho'Gath - Terror of the Void (Enough said... no I'm just joking)\n\nBut, yes Cho'Gath is really over powering especially late game, so it's best to end as early as possible. Now saying ending \"I want to end it early.\" But, actually finishing early is a complete another thing. I normally beat a Cho'Gath by getting a lot of ganks early and shutting him down and being a mage (Orianna - Ahri - Annie mainly raged type mages) Otherwise he will just send you to the Void by silencing you and well a silenced mage is a useless mage. Now in blind pick this won't work because you don't know if enemy is a Cho'Gath or not.\n\nThis isn't really helpful but against Cho'Gath you can't just beat him up and hope you win, you need to be smart.","replies":[]}]}
