We aren&#039;t asking you to reveal the next champion or anything, just want to know why some things are happening and if they are intended or not. :)\r\n\r\n1. The champion select chat block.\r\nSure your computer connected before everyone else and you may have typed &#039;mid&#039; 0.001 seconds before everyone else joined, but is that really worth blocking you from the chat for 10 sec and losing all chances of getting the lanes you want? \r\nwhy is this there? and can we remove it? \r\n\r\n2. Nexus destruction ends chat. \r\nYou&#039;re halfway through writing &quot;GG&quot; or &quot;WP guys, great game&quot; when the nexus explodes and deletes everything you have written in the chat and closes it, then you have a frantic second or two trying to type /all or pressing &#039;shift return&#039; (and usually pressing the wrong buttons in the process) AND trying to re-type what you just typed, and its just not necessary, the nexus destruction doesn&#039;t need to end the chat, so why does it? and can we fix it?\r\n\r\n3. PROJECT: Yi voice volume.\r\nPROJECT: Yi is a legendary skin and we pay around $20 for it, he has one of the best voice overs/filters in the game, and yet you cant hear him because his voice volume is really really quiet (it never used to be like that) So why is it like that? and can we change it?\r\n\r\n4. Sounds don&#039;t correspond to actions (timing).\r\n(this one is a little bit bigger of a problem) But sounds play before the action finishes, it is really noticeable on auto attacks, (lets use Diana as an example, because she is the most recent champ i experienced it with) if you AA something and then click away as soon as you hear the sound of your sword hitting the opponent, it cancels the AA without dealing damage, (it should be that the sound indicates that the damage has happened.) and i have lost many duels because we were both low, i auto&#039;ed them heard the sound and flashed as soon as i heard the sound, and then died because my AA didn&#039;t even hit them and now I&#039;m a sitting duck. The perfect example to show this is Lee Sin&#039;s Q, if he dashes to you on the second part of his Q, if you flash away as soon as you hear the sound of him hitting you, (and it looks like Lee has stopped as well) Lee Sin still follows you, which has also cost me many deaths, you need to have your timing perfect to escape his Q but without getting hit by his next move to auto, and it doesn&#039;t help if the sound (one of the key factors for determining actions) has incorrect timing.\r\n\r\n5. Dashing while under Crowd control at the moment of impact.\r\nFor this example i will use Shen, Morgana fires her Q at Shen, just as its about to hit Shen dashes sideways out of the way, however Shen ends up at his new location but is also snared. By definition this SHOULDN&#039;T happen, if he is snared he CANT perform the dash, and if he DASHES it means he has avoided the snare, so how can he be hit by the snare AND have dashed. Its impossible to have both. (not to mention Unfair to Shen because now he is snared AND his dash is on cooldown.) this occurs on flash as well. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo if someone at riot could comment about these things, and just clarify why these things are happening, if they are intended or not, and if not will they be fixed, or at the very least just promise to at least mention these things to the people in charge of dealing with them.\r\n\r\nthat would be very much appreciated :)\r\n\r\ni know they aren&#039;t major game breaking bugs, but that doesn&#039;t mean we should ignore them. :)","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2016-01-16T06:36:52.625+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd agree 100% with everything except maybe the last one. The auto attack sound tricks me often. Could be because of slight ping change? I know that chronic lag can really change how the game behaves. The chat block is hella stupid. Sometimes you don't even have to say ANYTHING and it'll still block you until every role has been called.
