I'm not a game designer or that good of a player but in my opinion Assassins are better to play against now than before. Assassins are strong in certain scenarios and team comps but they are still niche (needs certain team comps and opponent team comps to be successful) where as I feel like Mages are still the safe go to's for rounded out team comps.\n\nI feel like currently mages are still stronger.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-01T12:42:10.487+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for replying Marauder!\nA discussion sounds good!\n\nFirstly, you say that the first assassin comes in at #18 for midlaner wins, but on the pic you show there, it looks like Ahri is #2?\nand if she isn't an assassin i don't know what is.\n\nIn any case, the 3 mages i main {{champion:268}} {{champion:136}} {{champion:163}} all have sub 50% winrates on lolking _(and those 3 mages will be the ones most affected by this Rylai's change.)_ So you can imagine my salt when i realise that my 3 mains might fall of the board completely just from 1 nerf. \n\nAs for the rest of the mages; most of the ones that have high win-rates are ones with low pick-rates (Ziggs/Xerath/Karthus/Galio. etc.) meaning the only people playing them are the ones who are competent with them. So naturally their winrates will be higher.\n\nWhile every man and his dog and all his dog's fleas, play assassins. \nSo naturally the constant influx of new players will drag assassin winrates down. \n\nYou say that assassins are strong in certain scenarios, and weak in others.\nThis may be true for full assassins like LB and Talon. But assassins that are cross-breed like: \n\nZed (Assassin/Fighter)\nYasuo (Assassin/Fighter)\nLee Sin (Assassin/Tank.... Seriously? they actually allow an assassin/tank hybrid?) \nVayne (Assassin/ADC... also questionable..)\n\nThose champions have very little weakness in comparison, its like a Pokemon that is Water/Fire type, it covers its own weaknesses, while retaining its strengths.\n\nAll of those champs are strong, their winrates might not show it because of all the new players wanting to try out the \"cool\" champions. \nBut a Yasuo/Zed/Lee/Vayne player who actually knows what they are doing, is near impossible to stop. (far more unstoppable, than an Aurelion Sol player with the same skill.) \n\nThis is the problem as I see it:\nThe champions who don't actually need Rylai's to be effective, but still build it anyway, (Viktor, Ori etc etc.) are probably too strong with it, and won't really miss it when it goes. But the champions that actually NEED Rylai's take a massive blow with this nerf.\n\nYou say you play Sol, well as one Sol player to another: Do you believe that he wont seriously be affected by this change?\nHis entire kit relies on keeping the permaslow active (it even pretty much says as much in his champion spotlight), and with movement speed being readily available on a great many items (mainly assassin items) i don't think 20% slow is going to cut it.\n\nFor a champion that relies so much on expert positioning, and is practically useless when someone gets inside his stars (which all assassins can do with ease i might add) he needs the 40% slow just to keep them at bay.\n\nI have a 70% winrate on Sol, so i cant say that he is weak. But he does have huge counterplay, (Hell, accidentally being nicked by a Draven E puts 80% of his damage on hold for 6/4 seconds.) So unlike many other mages, Sol desperately needs Rylai's, because champions like Yasuo/Lee Sin don't have that downtime.\n\nYou are 100% right in saying that mages make a more rounded team comp, I think so as well, which is probably why mages have a higher winrate. (Because most games with assassins have like 3 assassins per team, and so they lose because they lack tanks anyway, they don't necessarily lose because assassins are weak.)\n\nNow we turn our attention to Azir.\nIn an Ask Riot post a while back, Riot stated that they wanted to buff Kalista and Azir (meaning that they want Azir to be stronger than he is currently). The Azir buffs in question are small buffs to the tower (which doesn't really help him in fights anyway... at least not if the enemy team has a brain-cell between them), and 2 seconds less on his W cooldown. \n\nThose are good buffs! 2 seconds is nothing to scoff at! But while Im not a balance designer, personally, I still don't see those buffs being able to compete with **-100 HP -25 AP -20% slow and -15 shield-strength.** In my eyes, Azir will lose power this patch, not gain it.\nI fail to see the logic behind this, they give with one hand and take even more away with the other.\n\n_________\n\nBack to contrasting mages/assassins\n\nOn paper, and according to statistics, mages may have the upper hand. But all it takes to see the real picture is to listen to the community.\nWho are the most criticised champions? Who are the most hated by everyone except those who play them?\n\nIt certainly isn't Karthus, it certainly isn't Aurelion Sol, it certainly isn't Ziggs.\nIs it Yasuo? Yes. Is it Vayne? Yes. Is it Lee Sin? Yes.\n\nWether they win games or not, people despise playing against these champions. \n\n**So i ask you, who is _really_ out of balance?**\n\nThe mages with slightly higher statistics, that no one complains about?\nOr the mildly weaker assassins with the longest list of complaints I've ever seen?","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-12-02T00:33:42.075+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"True Ahri is at #2, I should have been specific about my definition of assassin in the post. I meant specifically the items/assassins affected by the assassin update, as was originally mentioned in your post \"as if mages weren't disadvantaged enough by the new assassin update..\"\n\nI don't think Ahri has gotten any stronger from the assassin update. She is strong =D she can be a kite mage or assassin (or BOTH when super ahead). But I don't think the assassin update is relevant to her, and I don't think rylais users are good against her (probs the opposite). Ahri is also a Rylai user in certain cases.\n\n\nYes, {{champion:268}} {{champion:136}} {{champion:163}} have low overall win rates but they are in a special category of \"difficult\" champions. This means that not matter what when you look at average winrate they will usually have sub 50%. However if you look at more experienced players they usually extend well into the 55 or 60% + win rate (like you and Aure).\n\n\nI don't think just because champions have low play rates means they will have high winrates. That's only part of the equation. Example being Diana, Aure, Vlad, GP. I use those examples because I believe these champions are actually strong WITH low play rates (sub 3%) AND have a sub 50% win rate. If low play rate = high win rate by default then we should be buffing these champions...which I don't think would be good for the health of the game.\n\n---\n\n> Zed (Assassin/Fighter)\n> Yasuo (Assassin/Fighter)\n> Lee Sin (Assassin/Tank.... Seriously? they actually allow an assassin/tank hybrid?)\n> Vayne (Assassin/ADC... also questionable..)\n> \n> Those champions have very little weakness in comparison\n\nI think this highlights the crux of your complaints and potentially the main outcry of general players. In my opinion you are thinking of champions and their strengths or weaknesses in a very 1 v 1 setting or nature. You and a lot of players aren't necessarily taking into account the setting of the game (5v5) and scaling.\n\nOf course it may seem like assassins may have very little weaknesses in a 1 v 1 situation (although I doubt any melee assassin could 1 v 1 a tank with same gold). But that's what they are designed to do. Isolate and kill priority targets. I think champions like, the new assassins, master yi, vayne, noct all have very similar weaknesses. In a game against champions like this there can be a lot of \"BS\" feel when you get taken out, because by the time they are on you its probably already over. We tried to alleviate a little bit of that with the assassin update by adding in bigger windows to dodge/avoid damage. A big part of counter play that a lot of players miss or don't realise is that you can actually play to not get caught in those 1 v 1 situations. Team play actually shuts down champions like that REALLY HARD. I personally think their win rates are lower in general not because everyone plays them (although that is a factor). It has more to do with the fact that League of Legends naturally funnels people into team scenarios (not all the time). \n\nAssassins have generally lower win rates because they have to win the game differently than the natural course of a LoL game. Assassins need to accelerate the pace of the game, create pick opportunities through split pushing or high risk behind enemy lines maneuvers. If they aren't ahead by the time grouping for towers/dragons/barons starts happening (which imo naturally starts happening after the first few towers are taken) then they pretty much lose. If the other team only has 2 glass cannons, then their win rate significantly decreases. If an assassins team can't hold their own 4 v 5 while the assassin contributes nothing looking for the right pick, then their win rate significantly decreases. If the enemy carries are never alone, then assassins win rates significantly decreases.\n\nI think a lot of the complaints around assassins comes from the fact that the counter play options available to players aren't as obvious as certain tactical decisions once a fight has begun. But more abstract like team play, holding cc, positioning, grouping, trading objectives, wave clear and vision.\n\nI actually think when you stop thinking about champions in a sense of which champion can take out which champion, and start thinking more about which champion is better at winning a game of League of Legends (thats how I define strength) you will find that Mages have more tools and options open to them.\n\nYes players criticise assassins, but there is a reason why control mages see significantly higher play in the pro scene than assassins (With the exception of LB cause god damn faker haha). I think there are things we can change about assassins to make them complained about less (like the changes we made to Talon and Rengar) but I don't think they need to be nerfed.\n\nEverything I have said is a broad look at assassins vs mages. Obviously you seem more concerned with your main champs, so I will dig into them a bit more. Once again all just my opinion, I'm not a game designer. I just play this game too much haha.\n\nI think we do expect to make adjustments to champions off the back of this nerf to Rylais. But what it really allows us to do is instead of balancing champions around Rylais it lets us balance the champions themselves.\n\n\"We've tended to create more balance issues than we've addressed by trying to pre-emptively compensate for cases like this in the past. Plan is to make the Rylai's change and then see who does/doesn't need work as a result of it. - Meddler\"\n\n{{champion:268}} - I think Azir is definitely in a tough spot right now and it sounds like we do want to bump him up a bit. The problem with Azir is new or mediocre players struggle really hard with him while players that understand him can do really well. (on champion.gg he has a 59% winrate when you look at players that have 15-50 games with him). When he was perceived as \"strong\" by the general public you could see how oppressive he was. I think Azir just has too many tools available to him so balancing him is extremely difficult. Potentially you would need to take time to rethink some of his abilities vs just adjusting numbers. He's one of those champions that is just down right oppressive in high level play or current situation where imo a lot of players underrate him but the true azir specialists still do find good success with him.\n\nA Champion with multiple escapes, anti flank tower ability, long range, persistent, bursty damage sounds extremely hard to balance. IMO we would probably need to take away some of his tools before buffing his numbers.\n\nRylais change will hurt him, but I think reducing his ability to become everything he is + a slow bot as well will open up more areas to buff.\n\n\n{{champion:136}} - I want to keep this one short. I actually think Aure is too strong atm. He can usually burst squishier champions in 1 rotation of GLP, stun, passive , ult. After that he has significant sustained damage with W. He is generally a little bit durable thanks to Rylais and GLP. He usually has higher movement speed with storm raiders surge and swiftness boots. Actually think Aurelion probs doesn't need too many changes after Rylais nerf as 20% slow + his movement speed + stun + GLP + ult still leaves him with more than enough kiting tools.\n\nAlso lets not mention his wave clear and roam potential because that really puts him over the top haha\n\n\n{{champion:163}} -  The biggest issue with Taliyah imo is the lack of ULT damage. I think she's probably okay right now as experienced players have 57% win rate on her. I don't play her much so this wont be too long. But her zone control and roam potential are high. Potentially GLP might be added to her core build (maybe instead of RoA?). I expect her to need small buffs but its not going to significantly impact her power level imo.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-02T02:00:01.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well everything you say makes sense in terms of numbers.\n\nThere are a couple of things i will pull you up on though:\n\n1. Ive seen Assassins 1v1 tanks at full build, Yasuo/Vayne/Lee are good examples (although Vayne isn't melee). Assassins shouldn't be able to put out both burst and sustained damage. This is where combining classes (Assassin/Fighter) (Assassin/ADC) (Assassin/Tank) comes crashing down. It gives assassins a lear advantage over classes that should be their direct counter. Ive also seen Zed 1v1 tanks _(the result of giving 'lethality' to every item he buys)_\n2. You say that its the team situations that bring assassins back into balance. Yet Zed's burst happens so quickly, there is nothing stopping him from jumping headlong into an enemy team, ulting the ADC, and firing off his whole combo (which takes no time at all).\nIf he lives long enough to press R a second time, then he lives and still poses a threat. If he dies, then he has still done his job and made it a 4v4 without the enemy carry. Its a win either way. Yasuo is also someone who isn't make weaker by team situations, a good multi-person knockup from himself (or someone else), pretty much annihilates the enemy team. Team situations may stop people like LB, but LB isn't really a problem anyway, after the assassin updates, she is about as balanced as I've ever seen.\n\nI think part of the problem is that we both define 'strength' in different ways. You say the a champion's potential to win the game, is what makes them strong. I would disagree slightly. Winning the game is only the **secondary** objective of league of legends. The primary objective _(and the reason why most people below diamond play it.)_ is having fun. \nSo i believe that Yasuo is more powerful than Swain (despite Swain having much better statistics) because he just just so much more fun.\nAs a result there are tons more Yasuo's than swains, so therefore Yasuo directly affects the game more then swain does, despite Yasuo having a lower winrate than swain.\n\nIf a champion had 80% winrate, but only 3 people in the world played them, they wouldn't be much of a problem. (at least not until it got into pro-play level) But if a champion has a 50% winrate, but 90% of players wanted to play that champion. It would be much much more of a problem, and would make the game significantly less fun for everyone. (You hear overwatch players moaning about Hanzo and Reaper all the time, purely because they are so sick of seeming the same champion over and over and over again.)\n\nTherefore, the Primary objective of the game is being affected more negatively, by the champion that is statistically more balanced, than it is by the champion that is unbalanced.\n\nVirtually, no one has a problem with Aurelion Sol, (or many of the other mages), but so many people have problems with Zed and Yasuo, and Vayne. \nSo in my opinion, Zed/Yasuo/Vayne etc are the problem champs here.\n\nI want to be clear, that I'm not saying this purely because i main Sol and the others. \nI am bias towards Sol obviously, but that doesn't make me wrong. I play my fair share of assassins just like everyone else.\nKassadin/LB/Talon to name a few, And Fizz/Yasuo were my first mains. \nSo I'm not an anti-assassin protester or anything.\nIve just played against Yasuo/Lee/Zed/Vayne so many times, and they may not win every time, but in every game theres always people who get really frustrated with them (sometimes its me, often its not.) And that doesn't happen anywhere near as much, with other champions. Theres bound to be a reason for that.\n\nSo in my opinion:\n**The champions that are bad for the game, are the ones that everyone despises, not the ones that are 1% or 2% more likely to win than another.**\n\n_________\n\nI agree that nerfing Rylais is a good idea. I Disagree that the slow is what should be nerfed. \nYou have to look at Rylais in one of two ways:\n\n1. Its either a damage Item that gives too much HP and Utility.\n2. Or its a Utility item that gives too much HP and Damage.\n\nI personally see it as a utility item, (if you want damage you should go for Ludens, and if you want HP you should go for RoA or the hextech items) so that leaves Rylais as the main utility item for mages. Therefore isnt it the extra stats like HP and AP that should be nerfed? Not the actual utility of the item? Seeming the utility is what people buy it for?\n\n________\n\nWhile I do care about my mains, they aren't the reason i made this post.\n\nI agree that Sol is too strong and should be nerfed, but i don't think that removing the slow is the answer.\n\n\nI personally don't think Azir needs to be buffed either. He is a champion that you just don't play if you're a beginner (just like Garen is a champion you don't play if you're a pro) Its not fair, but its the way it is. As long as there are skill differences between players, nothing balance-wise will ever truly be 'fair'.\nId rather have champions that are balanced for bronze, and too weak for challenger, and having champs balanced for challenger, but too weak for bronze. Than to have champions that meet in the middle, and are all too strong for bronze and all not strong enough for challenger. \n\nAzir was a monster early in the year, and i will fight tooth and nail to keep him from becoming that menace again _(i actually didn't play Azir for most of that time, purely because I was against him being so strong)_. But I also don't think that nerfing Rylais slow is the best way to tackle that.\n\nAzir is a tricky one to balance its true, and he has a LOT of tools. So if I were Riot. Instead of taking away the tools in order to justify the damage, take away the damage in order to justify the tools!\nAzir has lost so many fun tools (Placing W on towers, Passive CDR, E Knockup etc etc.) and has gained what? A couple of months in the sun before he was nerfed back into the ground.\nWhy not abandon his damage and make him a utility mage? That would be so much more fun than the damage/poke machine he is currently. Reduce his damage and give him back his tools.\n\nTaliyah is perfect as she is, i reckon. She provides enough damage and utility to pick up kills and help the team out. But not enough that the enemy team cant do anything against her. \nChanging her (either buffs or nerfs) will just run the risk of throwing her out of balance. \n\nI know that my opinions wont change anything in the decision making at Riot, so i don't even know why i have these discussions tbh.\nI just want everyone to have fun, and i don't think people are having as much fun as they could be having. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-12-02T03:41:21.459+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh I see the distinction you are talking about. \n\nFor the purposes of this discussion lets make the distinction between the below\n\nChampion strength/power - How much can it contribute to a win\nFun to play as - interesting mechanics, how true it delivers the fantasy, play making options, perceived strength\nFun to play against -  Ability clarity, opportunities for counter play\n\nI'm sure there are many more factors but those are some just of the top of my head.\n\nI'm glad we can make this distinction to describe what causes player frustration. League of Legends has a large and diverse player base, and fun is a extremely subjective thing. For example what an ARAM player finds fun might not be what a Ranked player finds fun. League of Legends is at its core a team based competitive game. For it to truly succeed at this we need to do a lot of different things right. \n\nI think it is clear that even when we talk about fun, what you find fun differs to what I find fun. What I find fun, is mastery of League of Legends. Team work, champion mastery, objective decision making, rotation decision making, vision control, strategic team compositions, sportsmanship, mental fortitude and leadership hopefully all culminating in a very satisfying win. Every game I try to learn and improve at my mastery of League and that's what I find fun (winning adds to it of course). \n\nOne of my most satisfying games in recent memory is this - http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/156003805/592592 \n\nI'm learning Cass right now and got 3 man ganked a few times in lane phase. This got Kat to like 3-0 I think and quite ahead. It was at a point where Kat was able to jump on me and pretty much insta kill me with Gunblade. But I was able to keep my head down, focus on the game. Stop the bleeding mid and safely extend the game. Then work with my team to use all of the more abstract aspects of league to overcome the enemy team who felt like they had a huge lead. (they happened to have 2  fed assassins which feels super relevant to this discussion). That was tough, i felt bad when I was feeding to a kat that could insta kill me but it was fun because I could exercise my mental fortitude to not tilt, not talk back to my team who were frustrated and continue working together to pull out the epic come back win.\n\nFor me fun is definitely why I play LoL. But fun in LoL to me means making the right play as often as possible, playing a clean LoL match, closing the match out when we are ahead or holding out for a sweet sweet comeback. It's not about extending won games to pad stats or try make more big plays, I don't find fountain diving that fun nor do I like it when others BM at the nexus.\n\nThis is where the discussion becomes super nuanced. Of course it's definitely easy to see that there are champions people complain about, usually assassins. But there are also a lot of players that \na) love to play them and find it fun\nb) dont mind playing against them\nc) enjoy having the strategic option of picking an assassin\n\nUltimately it's a balancing act, is it more fun to have assassins in the game? does it add more than it takes away? I'm not sure to be honest, but I personally love the strategic option of picking an assassin and I actually love the counter play style against assassins.\n\nIt's important for us to always listen to what is causing player frustration which is why we did rework a lot of assassins, they weren't fun to play against. But now, at least in my opinion, assassins have WAY more clear counter play opportunities and extended damage windows. I think this is much healthier for LoL overall than not having Assassins at all.\n\nAs for Rylais, I think persistent slow is just not good for the game. There's no counterplay and its not fun to play against. I actually think Rylais and Frozen Mallet could potentially be removed from the game so that we can think of better utility solutions over all. \n\nIt's great that you want players to have fun, personally I think a lot of players could have way more fun if they just learnt how to play against it instead of complaining =P","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-02T05:54:03.705+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I suppose thats it then isn't it.\nSubjectivity.\n\nWhat I find fun is a fair game, not a game where Vayne is 43/5 and Riven has 6 moba boots.\nThe best part of the game for me (apart from the in-depth diverse characters) is coordinating with my team mates (usually my friends, because they can actually hear what I'm saying.) and pulling off awesome team strategies by coordinating positioning and abilities.\n\nBut what i do not enjoy, is playing the same game over and over and over again. And when champs like Vayne and Lee have 35%+ pick rates, it starts to feel that way.\n\nSo wether assassins (or any class for that matter, but i pick on assassins because they are the only optional class.) are actually strong, or wether they are perceived as strong, doesn't really matter. It causes too many people to play them, and no one has fun vs the same champs again and again. There are over 150 champs in league, theres no reason why we should have the same 4 champions in every game. \n\nIts interesting that you brought up that game (congrats on the nice win btw!) becasue to me it seems like the assassins were the ones doing well, and that no one could do much against them, but its the mage that won the game?\nWhich relates to how people think assassin are more powerful, but the mages have better stats.\n\nMany assassins do have way more counterplay now, its true, but some that the assassin rework missed (Looking at you Zed and Yasuo.) still have far less counterplay than other assassins. \n(Also I'm still hazy on how giving Rengar another dash and making him immune to CC gives him more counterplay? He still kills you in the same amount of time from what I've seen.)\nBut Kat and LB updates are amazing, i never thought either of those champs could be balanced.\n\nRylais is only a perma slow on a select few champions, the majority of mages run out of abilities long before the slow becomes permanent. \n\nIts true that people would have more fun if they learned to play against what they found hard, rather than just complain (Myself included)\nBut that isn't always the case, I can play against Yasuo/Zed as well as the next man (I wouldn't have such high winrates on Sol and Taliyah (not so much on Azir tho) if i couldn't play against champs that are in every second game)\n\nBut even though i can play against them, I (like so many others) hate every second of it.\n\n________\n\nI suppose the whole crux of all my arguments is this single point:\n\nEverything is fine in the right doses, Yasuo is fine, as long as there isn't one in every single game. Rylai's is fine when it's used by champs who were built around it (like Sol), but not fine when every mage in the game wants a piece of it.

Personally I think it's because they are all extremely fun to play and when you play as them you feel the power fantasy being fulfilled.\n\nNerfs to champions like these don't affect pick rate too much imo, we need to find more ways to bring up other champs to their level. I would rather us continue to rework and introduce new compelling champions that equal or exceed those 4's \"fun factor\". I don't want us to remove fun champions from the game.\n\nOnce again fun is a balancing act right? The fact that those 4 champs are picked so much means a tonne of players have fun playing them.\n\nThe people that play against them either think;\n\nSame champs every game gets boring like you\nthey dont mind\nThey enjoy playing against high mechanical champs\n\nSo I think we agree there is a problem. But our solution is not to subtract 4 great champs, but to raise other champs to their level of fun. It will never be perfect as maybe the LoL player base just has more aspiring kung fu masters and samurais than aspiring vikings or wizards. But hopefully as reworks and new champions are released we can slowly chip away at that number.\n\nWould love to see your match history and understand if you personally are seeing those champions more often than regular or if there is a bit of negativity bias at play =P","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-03T00:55:07.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea its a good discussion ^^\nthe ones i have with you always are so insightful! :D\nthanks for taking the time to talk with me btw!\n\nYea those champs have always been high pick rate champions.\nBut it has to be something other than just 'fun to play', its partially to do with difficulty as well\n\nAll of those champions Lee Sin, Yasuo, Thresh, Zed (with the exception of Vayne) are all champions that LOOK really tricky and complex, but aren't actually that difficult to play. (Talking about playing to a decent level, not mastering. To master them does take skill of course.)\n\nSo its really bang for your buck, you get to look flashy and pro, while actually doing very little.\nYasuo for example, you just spam E through some minions, and no one can tell wether you're a retard, or a 500,000 mastery point Yas main, because you look tricky and pro doing it.\nLee Sin gets praised for his amazingly tricky combos, but its not actually that hard to flash in front of someone, Q them and then kick them back, and Q to them, (i know because I can do it and i hardly play lee at all.).\n\nSo while i cant deny that they are all really fun champions to play, i think their 'perceived vs actual' difficulty plays a large part as well.\n\nIf it didn't, champions like Azir/Kalista/Elise etc would all be highly played as well. But because those champs ARE as difficult as they look, its not worth it for most people, they could just play Zed and look pro without putting in as much effort. \n\n(Im not saying Zed doesn't take skill, i know he does, but you CAN just put your cursor on the enemy and Press RWEQR, and still get a kill while looking skilful. (speaking from experience))\n\nSo while I'm sure more people want to be a Rogue Samurai rather than a Undead General on mission of vengeance. \nThe difference between Kalista's 1.8% pick rate, and Yasuo's 21.7% pick rate can hardly be summed up as simply as \"More people like playing as a Samurai.\"\n\nKalista is in my opinion, the most fun, and certainly the most interesting ADC in the game, but no one plays her.\nand it cant be because of her theme (she's a zombie.. who doesn't like zombies?). Admittedly she is less powerful than Yasuo, but if nerfs don't affect the pick rates of 'fun' champions like you say, then theoretically it shouldn't make a difference. \n\nThere has to be something other than \"the fun of being a samurai is greater than the fun of being a zombie\" at play here, and I personally think that what it is, is \"greater rewards for less effort\" Both Yasuo and Kalista can carry a game, and both look f*ckin badass while doing it. BUT more effort needs to go into playing Kalista than it does for Yasuo.\nThat is my theory.\n\nSo rather than remove Yasuo from the game (which is a terrible solution), I think either increasing the skill it takes to get high rewards, OR decreasing the value of the rewards he can get with the level of skill he has atm, is the solution.\n\nWhile I am a full supporter of releasing new champions that can rival the popular champs in terms of \"fun\".\nThat has failed to happen for a long long time. \n\nOut of the last 17 champions released, only 3 of them have have been universally popular (Jhin, Ekko, and Yasuo.)\nnow that isn't such a great return rate. (the ratio is even worse if we include reworked champs like Taric and Yorick)\n\nSo while I'm all for releasing new champions, at the rate that 'popular' new champions are released, i think its more likely that Yasuo/Vayne/Lee/Thresh/Zed get eventual re-works before theres enough new popular champions that can rival their pick rates. (Lee sin is ancient enough for a re-work anyway.)\n\nThe champions that have been released this year are fantastic in mu opinion (Obviously Sol and Taliyah, have become my mains, and Iven is starting to rival kindred as my favourite jungler.) But a lot of people don't see it that way.\n\nI would love to get my hands on the statistics of:\nHow many people play the popular champs VS how many people cant stand playing _against_ the popular champions VS how many people don't care.\n\nFrom what i have gathered in game and on the boards, the majority of people who don't play the popular champions, really don't like them.\n\nSo while you may say \"We don't want to decrease peoples fun by making Lee/Yas etc, less fun.\"\nMaking them less fun may infact give MORE people more fun, even if the Lee/Yas mains don't like it.\n\n\nAs for my match history, its mostly ARAMs atm _(cos my friend doesn't have good enough internet for normals, and he doesn't want to ruin peoples games if he suddenly gets lag)_\n\nBut the ones that arent ARAM are as follows:\n\n**Taliyah:** vs Zed + Lee (9/8/10)\n**Aurelion Sol:** vs Yasuo (10/8/21)\n**Azir:** vs _no problem champs_ (10/3/17)\n**Lux:** vs Yasuo (1/13/21)\n**Azir:** vs Yasuo + Vayne (13/5/10)\n**Lux:** vs Lee Sin (11/11/17)\n**Ivern:** Vs Zed (7/11/20)\n**Azir:** vs _no problem champs_ (6/2/4)\n**Lux:** vs _no problem champs_ (1/9/5)\n**Azir:** vs Lee Sin + Vayne (3/1/2)\n**Nocturne:** vs Vayne (11/4/3)\n\nSo out of 11 games that aren't ARAM, only 3 of them didn't have at least one of the problem champs in it.\nSo while i do have a negative bias, it is clearly not without just cause. \n(excuse my bad Lux games, the skin was just so shiny, i couldn't resist playing her when i got support, and i have never really played her before :S)\n\nSo as you can see, I vs these champions A LOT. and i still do _relatively_ well, so I'm not just moaning about champs that i get stomped by.\nits just so brain-numbing to play against the same champs again and again, and coincidentally happen to be the same champs that receive \"/ALL BS!\" calls more than any other champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-12-05T03:38:36.323+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What gets a champions play rate up is a multitude of factors\n\nPerceived strength (IMO why perceived is important is because players tend to over exaggerate)\nFun mechanics (big plays potential??!?!?!??!?)\nChampion fantasy (in terms of how many people want to be this champion)\n\n(there's probably more but these are 3 major ones I would say)\n\nUsing your example of Kalista and Yasuo.

But more importantly for us it would be to raise Kalistas perceived strength (and actual). \n\nKalista needs some bigger changes first though (she has too much in terms of hopping, rend AND save support every time). Once we clean up her identity we can then fix her numbers.\n\nBut in general we don't want to reduce a champion's fantasy or their fun mechanics. Changing perceived strength without affecting actual strength is difficult imo. But what we definitely should be doing is raising perceived strength and clearly defining a champions identity to help raise low play rate champions popularity. \n\nUnfortunately my point of view is even IF we had ideal balance and all champs were fun to play there will always be those champions you are played more than others. I truly believe champion fantasy plays a big role.\n\nEven in a perfect world I think there are going to be more Lee Sin players than Urgot players.

Perceived strength is a powerful factor.\n\nand I agree totally about champions fantasy playing a big part.\nand personally its a huge part of why I play champions (Hence Azir and Aurelion Sol.)\nBut don't think its as powerful as you think (Why are there more Annie players than Azir for example?)\nif I had to rate those two on the scale that you rated Kalista on:\n\n{{champion:268}} \nPercieved strength: 4 _(currently... lets not remind ourselves of earlier in the year)_\nFun mechanics: 8\nChampion Fantasy: 9\n\n{{champion:1}} \nPercieved strength: 7\nFun mechanics: 3\nChampion Fantasy: 3\n\nimagine putting Aurelion Sol and Garen on the same scale as well, the fantasy of being a Star Dragon vs some random Knight, doesn't really compare (especially seeming Sol has half an hour of voice lines. and Garen practically only says 1 word.)\nSo while champion fantasy is a large part, there must be more than either of us are considering. \nOr perhaps the definition of \"Fun mechanics\" is different to both of our perceptions? (Maybe the majority find easily landing a 900 damage annie Q, more fun than Shurima shuffling into an awesome play?)\nWho can say. Without surveying the whole population, we will probably never know quite what constitutes statistical 'fun' mechanics.\n\nI guess we are both basing our understanding of \"fun\" on what the two of us find fun, but maybe we are exceptions to the majority? Perhaps Jumping straight in as Jax or Xin is more fun to more people than skipping around as Kindred, or kiting as Kalista.\n\nIm not sure, maybe I've been looking at this from the wrong perspective...\n\n_________\n\nI think from now on, ill just play the game as it comes, ill play the champions I enjoy, and use the experience of playing against lots of Yasuo's and Lee's to just better my ability at playing against them!\n\nIll miss Rylai's but I'll live, all 3 of my champs have made sacrifices in their lore, maybe its my turn to do the same and not fight a battle that was pointless to begin with xD\n\nIt may not seem like it at times because of these posts, but to do trust you guys at RIOT, There are some rough edges for sure, but the vast majority of League is just such a brilliant game, one that I have played for over 4 years and one that I intend to continue playing for as long as i am able. So thank you.\n\n__________\n\nAlso, just my 2 cents on Kalista, (I'm lvl 7 and she is my main ADC.) her numbers are fine IMO. Kalista's essence is a kiter, and as of late she has been unable to do that job as well the perception of her advertises.\nWith high movement speeds creeping into a lot of champion's kit/items, and with slows becoming very powerful (hence the nerf to Rylais i suppose) Her Kiting is left wanting. Jhin, with his movespeed, slow and snare, seems to be better at Kiting than Kalista in her current state. Lucian and Ezreal both, also give her more than a run for her money. \n\nTheres no point buffing her damage, she will never out-damage champs like Jhin and Miss fortune, so why even try to make her compete? Give her back her own unique advantage, which is unparalleled kiting.\nI think that allowing Kalista to hop at normal speed, even while slowed, would be a huge buff to her.\nIt would allow her to kite more effectively in this meta riddled with perma soft CC, and means that would wouldn't need to adjust her numbers at all.\n\nI can see why you made slows slow her dashes! (being partially immune to slows is a huge deal.) but it still doesn't make much sense in terms of the larger context. (no other champion is slowed while dashing, so why should physics stop just for her?)\n\nanyway, thats my opinion, for what its worth.\n\nThis discussion has been incredibly fun, and very eye opening for me, thanks so much for taking so much time to talk this out with me :)\n(I know from experience that writing takes a lot of time..)\nI really appreciate it Marauder ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-12-05T20:51:06.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries mate! always happy to talk and discuss, although at times it is difficult because it gets busy.\n\nP.S.\n\nI rate annies fun mechanics a bit higher because she has BIG PLAY potential with tibbers ult on team.

Also these champs' late game have amazing 1v1 potential due to their HIGH mobility and crit burst (these champs are known for being able to 1v1 really easily). \n\nZed has that initial burst but lacks a huge portion of his damage without his ult and when he does ult it leaves him vulnerable to cc immediately as he comes out of shadows. a well timed silence, stun, nuke is enough to kill him. \n\na lee sin can be flayed out of his q or hop and if that happens he is very very very dead (IF he is building as an assassin, tank is different, he shouldnt have that overwhleming feel if hes a tank so i wont talk about that here)\n\n* I guess what im trying to say is that these champs have very distinct weaknesses in their kits (squishy and if they use their mobility; are wide open for an attack) and not knowing when these are and how to deal with them, makes them feel huge. I get that. Mobility is annoying, especially for skillshots (HI SOL). On the other hand they are very weak to point click abilities or low cast times (veigar ult, annie q/r, thresh flay, blitz ult, auto attacks, etc.)\n\nTank yasuo and ekko was cancer. and new rengar is too, level one a single auto+q does 1/3 of rivens hp in 0.1s. empowered q q deals 3/4 in 0.1s. literally no counterplay to that. when olaf runs at my adc with ult and ghost then just pounds him into the ground in a couple hits it really feelsbadman. similar to the new rengar :) thanks IMMUNE TO DISABLES (LETS MAKE AN ASSASSIN THAT CANT BE CC'D, IT WILL BE FUN THEY SAID xDDDDDDDDD)\n\n2. the above champs are overplayed\n\nthis is because people like to play a fast highly mobile game (assassins!!!!). champs with jumps are million times more likely to be played than those without simply because people like an extra flash or to be able to move around quickly.\n\nanother reason is that these champs are highly unique in their abilities, combos and interactions in dealing with other champs. also have a fair amount of versatility in how they are played.\n\nHell, i play riven because she is hard to master and just needs that many games to get better, every first riven game of the day is sloppy. After playing league for 5 years its hard to find annie or garen challenging (mechanically), also theres a long standing joke about riven mains (which is why she will be my only level 7).\n\nTLDR; assassins are weak against a team that is organised simply because they are squishy and get demolished by any cc which is why trying to find an opening in a 5v5      fight can be very difficult, but when it is found, your carry is dead.\n\nside note, I used to play lots of kalista (back when she was pick/ban and then for a while after. after the nerf that made slows also slow her auto attack she pretty much became obsolete as other champs were just more consistent/did the same thing and far easier to win with.\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\nback to mages, rylais being a core item on EVERYONE is/was dumb. Playing orianna and just dragging my ball through people for an obnoxiously high slow only to hit them with my w when it finishes, then q again is just not okay. the fact that mages who were already strong when they are being chased (ori, viktor) being able to kite even easier was way to oppressive. The stats were just too high.\n\nYou gotta realise that there are different tiers of items, low cost, mid cost, and high cost. low cost items are usually support items with the exception of wits end (who needs a lot of love because it doesnt scale into late that well)\n\n**maybe wits end builds into guinsoos?** <<-- HELLO @ RIOT <<--\n\nRylais being a high cost item just means that building it means that you will scale into late with it (high stats). while zhonyas, abyssal etc have lower stats they have a specific role in what they do (i.e. specialised items). specialised items often sit around mid cost, providing a decent amount of stats (which is not why you buy them) plus a really cool unique effect (which is why you buy them). stuff like ludens, rabadons are high cost with really good stats but lack niche situational utility. RoA is really cool in the way it works because you buy a mid cost item but after 10 mins it turns into a high cost item, much like tear upgrades.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-06T04:11:15.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea they are awesome!\nOne of my friends has the summoner name \"Rock Lee\" too (its a waste that he isn't a Lee Sin player haha)\nPain and Itachi are my faves tho.\n\nOh wow, not going to lie, that has made my day!\nI always thought her Q counted as AoE, not multi hit (thinking multi hit was like Fiddlesticks' E) and the wiki did say 40% slow too\nOf the 3 champs, I'm glad she is affected the least as i think she is in the best spot of all of them atm.\n\nthanks for that! :D","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2016-12-02T03:48:29.893+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maraudaur,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=FLu8wkIl,comment-id=000b0001000000000001,timestamp=2016-12-02T03:41:21.459+0000)\n\n> It&#x27;s great that you want players to have fun, personally I think a lot of players could have way more fun if they just learnt how to play against it instead of complaining =P\n\n\nThis made my day.

The prime differences between a mage and an assassins is assassins are high mobility burst champions who can kill anyone they set their eyes on. Their kits have been made so that the can focus one target. Mages **trade** mobility **for** long range burst. There is some balance between them. Why an assassin can go in and get a penta? It's the way the player builds the champ, not the kit of the champ. The kits of an assassin have moderate cooldowns to stop them from spamming but many players build CDR and assassins are known to scale well into the late game. Mages deal heavy long range damage, mind you. Vel'koz can do up to 800 **TRUE** damage if he procs his passive on the target (pretty easy, honestly). As for Sol, He does have his windows of weakness, and it's the assassin's job to exploit the weakness and kill him","replies":[]},{"poster":"Corehog","date":"2016-11-30T09:00:21.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing with mages though is that most of them already _have_ a slow.\n\nThe health isn't super important as most mages do burst damage and aren't within the immediate circlejerk that is teamfights.\n\nAs for the AP, sure it's a bit of a punch in the gut, but AP generally scales massively compared to AD (AP buff from Infernal Drakes and Elder Dragon, Baron Nashor, Blue Buff (which I just found out is called Crest of Insight?), Elixir of Sorcery and Rabadon's Death Cap)","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-11-30T09:37:21.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Champions like Azir, Aurelion Sol and Taliyah, need that 40% slow (especially Sol) in order to maximise their damage, their existing skies are for different purposes.\n\nPlus they are taking the AP scaling away from blue buff anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Corehog","date":"2016-11-30T12:50:47.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really.\n\nTaliyah's slow on her E has a base of 20% plus an additional 4% per 100 AP\n\nAzir's slow on his Q has a base of 25% plus an additional 25% per extra soldier.\n\nA.

Now usually the enemies try to get out of that zone as quickly as they can. Thus nullifying the slow. Plus you can only use the boulder field every 16/8 seconds, and a small slow every 16 seconds really isn't that big of a deal.\n\nAlso think about Taliyah's playstyle, she does damage by keeping parallel to the enemy while moving, (so she can land all 5 rocks on her Q)  Rylai's is what allows her to do that properly.\n\nRylai's is also what she uses to kite and chase. Having an enemy running at you, but keeping them at bay with Rylai's slow on your Q is a huge parti of her playstyle.\n\nAzir's slow is just as pathetic as his shield. You have to hit multiple soldiers for it to do anything, and even then, you can only hit a maximum of 2 (unless youre attacking a fully stacked cho'gath) because the soldiers spread out when you use Q.\nRylai's is what he uses to, chase/kite, and keep people in his Soldier zones.\n\nSol doesn't need a slow?
