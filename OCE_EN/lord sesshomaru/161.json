Graves’ attack is a cone of 4 bullets whose AD ratio scales up by 33% over game time. The first bullet does 0.75-1.1 tAD (by level); extra bullets deal 33% of that. Each bullet can apply On Hit Effects, but only once per target. Graves’ crits fire more bullets (8 normally, 10 with Infinity Edge), empowering him at close range to burst a target and long range to deal AoE damage.\n2. Graves stores two bullets at any time. After using them, he must reload. Reload has a longer delay and is reduced only slightly by attack speed. Graves’ time between attacks otherwise is reduced dramatically by attack speed.\n3. Unlike other basic attacks, Graves’ bullets hit the first unit they collide with.\n\n\nif graves hits all 10 bullets in a crit :)\n\nR.I.P\n\n250% x (110% + 9x33%) = op\n\n(though im just assuming his bullets can do critical damage, they may not and the extra bullets serve as the crit)\n\nwhat more could you ask for :)\n\nEdit: now i think about it, would riot actually let someone have 1000%+ crit damage?\n\nremath!: 1.10 + (0.33 x 9) = 407% (more likely)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hynnil Magnus","date":"2015-11-08T10:59:48.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maraudaur,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=BcuB17WA,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-11-06T12:19:07.316+0000)\n>\n> We are literally doing a rework of adcs and adc items soon? come on man =P\n> \n> Have you seen the changes a bunch of adcs changed + a tonne of item changes too!\n> http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/2016-season-update/preseason.html\n> \n> We have listened and agreed thats why we are making ALL these changes\n\nExcept this is not helping diversity in all lanes.
