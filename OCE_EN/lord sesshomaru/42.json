We had Irelia, Xerath, Ekko, Jhin, and Nami. \nEkko even went SO ham on her, he hit EVERYTHING, and she killed him and came out of the fight with the same amount of Hp she had at the beginning. \n\nShe had a good kda but was far from fed. Ekko and Irelia went in first, she destroyed irelia, by the time irelia died, Xerath was there helping Ekko, he died near instantly, as he was dying Jhin and I turned up and threw everything on her, Ekko was just dead at that point, both jhin and I just evaporated, then she waited for Jhin&#039;s GA, and killed him before he could get even 1 AA off. \n\nSeriously, no ADC should be able to do that... no CHAMPION, should be able to do that.\n\nSeriously life steal items should be like support Items, you can get ONE of them. \n\njust notice how most of the 'problem' champs are all attack-speed/lifesteal ones..","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-09-05T14:23:30.433+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like how QAPLA is over 75% of the comments and then goes \"most people disagree with you\".

I'm sorry you don't know how to play against a Vayne. That's not our problem. In fact, there isn't a problem here at all.  You just don't know how to play against a Vayne and you've decided that the reason being is because of a particular item. Steraks gage is more defensive than offensive because the lifeline passive is life saving in fights where you're likely to be blown up by assassins and whatnot. Try playing ADC for once and you'll understand what I mean.  Vayne is a LATE GAME scaling champion. If you let her get to that point in the game then she will absolutely destroy you if she has good positioning.
