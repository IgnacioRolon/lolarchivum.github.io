I know it lets you buy all of the tier 3 runes and some over, but I'm not sure how many, so anyone who buys tier 2 runes may have to ticket support to get some/all removed at some point.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-06-26T09:41:00.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rune limit is 3 quints and 9 of the other types of the same runes if thats what you meant?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-06-26T09:57:29.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Negative, seras is referring to the hard limit imposed on the total overall amount of runes you can have on your account.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-06-26T10:11:25.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-06-26T05:57:18.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"0.33%","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-26T05:59:36.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oops my mistake, good catch.
