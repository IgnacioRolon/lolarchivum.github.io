His mechanics are good, he&#039;s an ADC main, he plays every ADC very well, and he picks his champions entirely based off allied and enemy team comps. Also, unlike me, he actually bothers to learn about the finer points of the game to try and get ahead.\n\n\nHe&#039;s been playing for around 7 years now, and just like every other season, he just got placed bronze 5.\n \n\n#The students best the teacher\n\nHe taught me to play, Ive worked _(side note, NEVER &#039;placed in&#039;)_ my way up to silver every year for several years now, _(and I play shit-all ranked.)_\nHe taught another one of out friends to play a year or so ago, that friend got placed silver\nHe taught someone that I introduced into the game, and that friend got silver 2 in a placements once.\nHe finally convinced his girlfriend to start playing _**a**_ _**month ago**_, she just got placed silver. She only plays 3 champs...\n\nBut every season, no matter how many wins he gets in placements, bronze 5.\nJust because the very first time he played ranked, when he was still new, he didn&#039;t do well in his placements. So every year afterwards, because you always get placed lower, he always gets slapped right back at the bottom. \n\nHe has said many times to me that he doesn&#039;t mind being placed low, it just makes the climb more interesting and satisfying. \nBut i&#039;ve seen his games, and because he&#039;s always at the bottom, he gets matched with the most special souls... bless them.\n\n\n#it shouldn't be: Improvement OR Ranked.\n\nAnd seeming we play tons of normals together _(my normals games number way over 4000)_, we have much more accurate mmr in normals, which I think is gold level _(or at least I hope so, seeming there are golds in all our games all the time)_, and he goes from that level of play which challenges both of us, to having his support spend the whole fight walking back and forth deciding wether go in or run away, and failing to do either.\n\nI&#039;ve been in bronze 5 before, and I don&#039;t care what anyone says, that shit is wayyyy harder than anything i&#039;ve seen in silver, or at gold level. \nIt was hell of a lot of work, completely overshadowed by pure luck, that got me out of it. And its not like its &#039;challenging&#039; hard either, its just &#039;pointlessly frustrating&#039; hard.\n\nSo it ends up just defaulting back to normals eventually once the fun has long since drained away, and he&#039;s done all he can to climb and gotten nearly nowhere, and fair enough, because when you&#039;re playing to have fun, why would you choose to play at that level, instead of a level where you can function as a team and improve yourself?\nNo one improves when you&#039;re not playing against people of your own level. It&#039;s like going back to pre-school, it doesn&#039;t matter how good your grades are, you&#039;re still not getting any smarter.\n\n#Your mistakes forever haunt you...\n\nHe made one mistake like 6 years ago in placements, and is still punished for it every season. Meanwhile his Gf who has been playing for just over a month gets placed higher than he&#039;s ever got. And we are all very proud and happy for her of course, don&#039;t get me wrong! and she&#039;s pretty good too. But those where his placements too, he put in just as much effort as she did. But he gets bronze 5 as per usual, just because of the weight of previous years constantly dragging him down, all because he didn&#039;t have a caring partner to help him through his first placements years and years ago.\n\nWhat is the point of the system when someone whose skills are clearly more advanced, can&#039;t make any headway. When others have higher ranks just dished up and served to them, purely because they happened to have a few good games the first time they played.\n\n\n____________\n\n#Conclusion\n\nSo my point is, either placements should mean dick-all and you just get placed at or around your existing rank, so you can just continue the climb from where you left off and don&#039;t get your fingers stamped on at the top of the cliff every new season, **OR** they should mean pretty much _everything_, and the start of each new season gives you a second chance at being placed.\n\nObviously this post or any like it will change nothing, this system is more convenient for our holy _&#039;lords-and-saviours&#039;_ at Plat + level, and god-forbid anyone other than them should matter, but it still makes me really annoyed seeing him constantly get this end of the stick, so I just had to say something.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2018-01-27T09:49:31.385+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Last year's placements put me in bronze 3/4 after winning 8-2, I climbed to silver V over the season. Then gold V over end of season/preseason, hovered in very very low MMR (silver 3-4) for a very long time (but my rank was protected because my MMR has to be faaar lower to go back to silver)\n\nThis year I went 4-6 and got placed silver 4.\n\nNorms MMR is not representative of ranked at all, I've gone vs plats and won because they're intentionally on off roles, off meta or first timing a champ. In my time in gold elo they were far more skilled.\n\nI'd like to believe that if I started a new account my MMR would somehow be better and I'd play well, but that just isn't true. I've seen streams of pro players being placed in plat or gold after placements, which was where faker was placed when he got so good at norms the matchmaking couldn't find anyone better. And clearly not every pro player gets challenger MMR in norms before moving onto ranked\n\nFinally, and most importantly, people are bad at evaluating the skills of themselves and those above them. Maybe your friend really is a bronze-low silver player. We don't have replays or anything, and it's easier to believe that than the system somehow being programmed into screwing you over.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jason","date":"2018-01-27T03:59:40.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just curious, you're posting this from a level 10 account?\n\nConfused a bit","replies":[{"poster":"Evelynnie","date":"2018-01-27T08:59:53.746+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is their Boards account.

He is not punished for his mistakes (to an extent), he is punished because he is not good at the game and can't climb out of bronze. Yes, it is special territory (I was bronze 5 0 lp at one point rip) but it's definitely climbable and is easier than other divisions, it just depends on _how_ you play. You say he plays in roughly gold mmr norms and does well which is good, it doesn't mean he's a good enough player though or that level. \n\nBronze is a rank where it's just filled with players who have absolutely no clue of anything. It's where 11 year olds will be found, people who don't play that much/try that hard/very new etc... or mentally disabled people (no flame).\n\nIf you have any game sense you would realise that they will do everything wrong. No mechanics, no macro, will do things for the sake of it. Yes, the 4 players on your team will fall into that, but the 5 on the enemy team also will (assuming no smurfs). Which means, if you just play  to carry it's easier than the other divisions. Win your lane or jungle (even as support, just play zyra/brand or something) and keep running down botlane until you get their inhibitors. They will forget about you, they will fight your team, they will try to kill you and fail. Yeah, 4v5's might be hard but you won't get them every game. It's just a matter of carrying bad players and if you can't do that you will never climb. \n\nIf you try to get better and eventually reach gold + level of skill and actually think about how to win games, specifically in bronze you will climb very, very easily.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2018-01-27T00:50:10.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Jailey Bay","date":"2018-01-27T01:13:34.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I completely disagree, I had the same issue as mentioned above, I was placed B3 my first ranked season a  few years ago, and because of Riot's system, I was forced to get placed lower for a few years in succession","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2018-01-27T04:36:11.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ToroidalBoss,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Y0nFvcfc,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-01-27T01:13:34.648+0000)\n>\n> I completely disagree, I had the same issue as mentioned above, I was placed B3 my first ranked season a  few years ago, and because of Riot&#x27;s system, I was forced to get placed lower for a few years in succession\n\nI was placed Gold 5 (fresh account) because I'm good at the game.\n\nIf you're hitting bronze off your promos, you're bad at the game.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-27T04:42:13.190+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean, it's more of a roulette if your bad at the game, you can easily hit silver as a bad player.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-01-28T11:44:41.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with JasonWazza on this point, \nWe all have both good and bad games, it doesn't matter how good you are.\n\nIf you just happen to have a few bad games when youre in provisionals, you suffer all season _(and beyond)_ because of it.\nLikewise, if you're a terrible player, but happen to get awesome teams, you'll get placed higher than perhaps you should. \n\nPerhaps your internet went haywire during your provisionals (it happened to me one game in my flex placements this season), and maybe that gave you a loss you didn't deserve. \n\nThere are too many factors in play to warrant these 10 games affecting your rank so harshly.\nMaybe if placements where over 30 games they might be more accurate.
