His E being manaless and ignoring 60% armour while being able to crit is garbage without even taking into account the rest of his kit. If they took away the armour pen and gave it a mana cost( even something small like 30) I would consider him in a good spot. Historically when a mana using champ has been given 0mana skills in their kit it has never ended well, leading to spam of the skill and abuse. Remember Lucians dash on release?\n\nTF is broken and heavily banned at most elos and competetive play, so much power in his ultimate +wave clear.\n\n\n The rest of the list seems fine.\n\n Surprised Trundle isn't on there, I would consider him to be historically one of the most balanced champions in the game of all time. I wouldn't say Gnar is OP at all either as a top laner, can't recall either of these ever being complained about before.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-08-31T10:52:05.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soraka isn't op if you take her out of the laning phase really early so instead of targeting ADC, target Soraka and she will have trouble till late game.","replies":[{"poster":"BadMrFrostie","date":"2015-08-31T12:24:43.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Put her in a comp that has a beefy front like(tanky top and jungle) and she will make them gods.
