(which is illegal)\r\n\r\nRiot publicly stated that we would have Draven heads/minions for 4 days, i count 2 and a half.\r\n\r\nSo unless Draven returns to the rift, Riot has not only broken the law, but broken its trust to the consumers (us) whats to stop them in the future going back on their word on sales or legacy skins or limited edition icons/wards etc.\r\n\r\nDon&#039;t give in to a few butthurt people who cant deal with an april fools joke Riot, don&#039;t break your word to your fan-base just to keep a few idiots happy.\r\nits only 4 days.\r\n\r\nsome of us enjoyed the comic relief of the Draven heads.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-04-03T01:04:20.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well yeah it was funny, but only really for the first few games. Then it just kinda became unnecessary and annoying. The skins were cool, but Riot realized that people literally refused to play their game for 4 days, and people have the right to not play the game. People have the right to complain that they don't like it. But in my opinion it's kinda dog to not bring us URF then cancel Draven Mode just because it's not exactly a hit. That is only because in contrast to URF Draven Mode didn't change much. \n\nIt's not as much disliking Draven Mode as much that it didn't change much about the game as URF did. It would be better if the faces didn't look like they were photo-shopped in in the last 15 minutes, and maybe said stuff and moved around. Draven Mode isn't bad, but you can't make a tradition of the biggest game mode in history then switch to a minor April Fools joke and expect fans to not be disappointed.\n\nPersonally, as a Draven main no less, I'm pissed that they disabled the Draven Mode. But what made me the most disappointed was if your not bringing URF, you have to bring something big, and if not, you can't just disable it like it never happened.\n\nBtw, new to this Australian Government vs. Riot Games law lock-in. How is them against the law to cancel a game mode because everyone hates it?","replies":[]}]}
