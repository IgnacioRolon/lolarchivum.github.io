They are the only team to ever get a ward skin with their championship team skins. _(even the teams afterwards didn&#039;t get a ward.)_\r\nAnd then when they get new skins for winning again, Riot makes them, then completely re-does them all to a standard thats way higher than any other championship team skins just because some of the community wanted them to, (yet they don&#039;t listen to the community in regards to improving other skins like Bloodmoon Yasuo before release). Not only that, but instead of the usual 5, they made 7 skins _(admittedly though one of which is not being released)_, but thats still an extra skin, also all the skins get new particles and recalls, unlike all the other team skins _(with the exception of SSW Talon, where he has mildly different blades)_ \r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nSo whats the deal? Yea SKT are crowd favourites, but should that entitle them to better rewards? \r\nIts kinda stink for the other teams, who gave it their all as well. \r\n\r\nAlso it was really really stink for Sivir mains: \r\n_&quot;Heres a cool skin for you guys.... **PSYCHE!** hahaha omg! You should have seen your face Sivir!&quot;_\r\n\r\nPS. Not that I&#039;m complaining about the new skins, they look awesome and I&#039;m a huge fan of improvement and progress, I just cant help but think it is kinda a little stink for everyone else.\r\n\r\n{{champion:12}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:15}}","replies":[{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2016-08-15T02:32:48.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason for the extra skin was for easyhoon it's not special treatment it's giving an amazing play the recognition that he deserves","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-15T04:03:21.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yet no one else has ever received the same recognition.
