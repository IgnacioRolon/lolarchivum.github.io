Your team always screams \"FOCUS JINX\" \"WTF GUYS FOCUS VAYNE\" etc. what if in order to focus the enemy ADC you have to walk straight through all 4 of the other team while they are attacking you, do you:\r\n\r\na. wade through the opposition and hopefully reach the ADC before you die \r\n\r\nb. focus the closest highest priority champion while putting yourself in the least risky position as possible. \r\n\r\nc. get out of the fight as quickly as possible \r\n\r\nd. (insert own answer) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 2. in a 5v5 fight the enemy champ that does the most damage (usually ADC or whatever) has a guardian angel do you:\r\n\r\na. focus them to pop the guardian angel even though they will still be 5 afterwards \r\n\r\nb. focus the next highest priority member of their team that doesnt have a guardian angel to give you the numbers advantage then focus the GA user\r\n\r\nc. ignore the GA user entirely as you cant kill them anyway and should get rid of the rest of their team \r\n\r\nd. (insert own answer)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 3. you are playing Azir, and you are being attacked by their team, 2 of them are in range of your soldiers but the ADC isn't and your Q is on CD do you:\r\n\r\na. attack the 2 low priority targets, that your soldiers can reach because you can do the most damage that way\r\n\r\nb. ignore the low priority targets within soldier range, to basic attack the ADC (high priority target) even though you don't do much damage \r\n\r\nc. get out of the fight \r\n\r\nd.

If you do wish to fight, what you do depends on your role. Generally\nADC: can hit whoever is closest.\nSup: Peels for ADC\nTanks, Some bruiser and mids: Engage, either cc enemy or force them to split into bad positions.\nBruisers and Assassins: Trying for a priority target, their kits are built for getting in and out of back lines. \nMages and anyone else; judging the situation, should aim for a priorty target but can assist with peeling before moving to squishies. \n\nIf their teamfight is much greater than yours focus on out-rotating, spliting, objective control or setting up picks.\n\nQuestion Two:\n The GA shouldn't be too much of an additional factor, play the teamfight like any other.   Ideally, kill them first, then focus others, have 2 - 3 in range of the GA zoning out enemies for the cc and dmg as soon as they revive.  If you can't do that, you can't do that; 5 people tunneling onto a GA kill for nothing is clearly not worth, so use your better judgement. Always best to pop a GA where your team can follow up and their can't. \n\nQuestion Three:\nThere are very little circumstances where a mid should stand in AA range of an ADC aaing them! You will die instantly.\nIn the case mentioned, getting he most damage off with soldiers to low priority target is better than AAs on the ADC, particular if you can deal dmg to both with a single solider.  Any dmg better than no dmg, esp if you're about to die. \nWhile c is the closest, you shouldn't \"get out\" but try to re-position yourself till you have cds to focus the ADC, and soyou can be protected by the tanks/bruisers. \n\nQuestion Four:\nA over B although once again specific team comp and scenarios could change this, for instance if the ADC themselves isnt that good, and you can kill an tank who engaged before the team fight erupts I'd say go for it. \n\n\nI don't know if this helped. A lot of things are situational. \nMy general advice, before each encounter/fight;\n1. Have a plan; what are you going to try a do\n2. Have the fight\n3. Could you stick to the plan? If no, go 4. If yes, go 5.\n4. Why not? Vision or not accounting for something. Go to 8.\n5. Did the plan work? If no, go to 6. If yes go to 7. \n6. Why not? Where did it go wrong? How can you change what you do to avoid this next time? Go to 8. \n7. Can you make it better? Work on perfecting!\n8. Redvise an even more amazing plan and repeat.\n\nHope this helps\nSkyprus","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-20T02:04:01.320+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm by no means highly skilled but I'll try my best to help out.\n\n> Question 1. Your team always screams \"FOCUS JINX\" \"WTF GUYS FOCUS VAYNE\" etc. what if in order to focus the enemy ADC you have to walk straight through all 4 of the other team while they are attacking you, do you:\n\nI'd say it depends what your role in the team is. As a tank you'd be in the front lines, peeling for your carries, which doesn't leave a lot of room for focusing the other teams carries. If you've got a gap closer, some CC and a reliable team then it is probably a good idea to do so as long as the other teams carries aren't too far behind their front line. As a carry you're obviously going to want to hit high priority targets, but only if it doesn't put you in a bad position. Basically closest high priority target (b).\n\n> Question 2. in a 5v5 fight the enemy champ that does the most damage (usually ADC or whatever) has a guardian angel do you:\n\nI guess it depends on the situation really. If the person with GA isn't that big a deal probably focus someone else to get a numbers advantage (b) but if they're the heavy hitter of their team probably focus them to get GA to pop and switch while they're reviving. I am unsure on this, I don't encounter this very often.\n\n> Question 3. you are playing Azir, and you are being attacked by their team, 2 of them are in range of your soldiers but the ADC isn't and your Q is on CD do you:\n\nAttack the ones in range of your soldiers. It's no use going 1v3 to basic attack their ADC as Azir.\n\n> Question 4. you are playing a champ like garen (i dont play him but he is useful for this example) his ultimate deals damage equivalent to missing health which means that at a certain percentage of HP you can execute any champ regardless of how much maximum hp they have, in a team fight do you:\n\nI'd say depends on which target gets to low enough health first. If your team is focusing the enemies tank while looking for an opportunity to engage effectively and the tank gets low enough, do it. That will give you a numbers advantage and probably get rid of the enemies only peel, making it easier for you to reach high priority targets. If a carry gets low before a tank/sup then I'd say it'd be better to do it and get rid of their damage dealers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Addicted To This","date":"2015-03-24T18:01:13.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Question one: \n\nIf your team is expecting only you to kill the ADC then i would suggest baiting your team.. \nLet your team take all the focus, all the instant stuns and slows etc and then you will be more free to kill ADC\nTeam fights can last a while and you don't have to do everything in the first 10 seconds. let them all become engrossed in the fight while you stand back and wait a  little bit.. you will have a clearer mind and can make right decision easier. \n\nQUESTION TWO: Take GA out first If it's on an ADC. ADC can really ruin your whole team if you don't get rid of them quick. And when they res it is with a small amount of health, and while they are waiting to res you have about 2-3 seconds where ADC can't move or attack. In all practicality GA Gives ADC a 2 second stun when 3/4 of their health is down and after the stun fades they have 1/4 HP left. \n\nTHREE: Just poke them as you run. \n\nFOUR: If the tank is on low enough HP to be executed I wouldn't bother with it. Something has already taken away 80% of it's life so it is probably dead soon anyway. Tank is usually last to die and so if tank is very low HP then most of his team are probable dead or have ran away and your team can just bully tank. Get rid of the High Priority One faster. Total Damage to team doesn't matter so much.\n\nand i think this is irrelevant but i will tell you anyway:\n\nA hero with %1 health can still do 100% damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-03-20T21:37:13.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much everyone, i have a much better idea of what to do in these situations now! a few of these have tripped me up in the past and now I'm more confident about what to do, thanks all :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-03-20T04:37:45.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Question 1. Your team always screams \"FOCUS JINX\" \"WTF GUYS FOCUS VAYNE\" etc. what if in order to focus the enemy ADC you have to walk straight through all 4 of the other team while they are attacking you, do you:\n\nGolden rule of thumb is to play smart. Whilst the general idea is to focus the ADC. If the act of doing so directly threatens your own immediate lively hood opt out. By this, I do not mean run away from the fight entirely. What my point is to position yourself and play smartly. In teamfights situations, ideally the enemy team will have a tank line limiting pathways to the carries. If it's possible, try to reposition that tank line and look for a clean line to the carries. Alternatively reposition yourself entirely into a clear line towards the carry. Note, you do not always immediately have to delete the enemy carry. If your team has any sense of coordination they too will play smart. Look at your composition look at there's. Poke, get that harrass. Get the enemy low with minimal dmg to yourself and your team. So that when their option to all out team fight becomes limited and then using this advantage to take objectives such as pushing a turret they will not be able to defend or securing bazza/dazza. \n\nQuestion 2. in a 5v5 fight the enemy champ that does the most damage (usually ADC or whatever) has a guardian angel do you:\n\nUsually, when a person buys a GA they are concerned for their own well being and theoretically are easy to take out. With that in mind, If, with minimal risk to yourself and your team are able to A, pop the GA and then proceed to pop the second spawn go for it. The key to killing someone with a GA is in my opinion the second spawn. During the time it takes to respawn from a GA you and your team should be able to position yourself so that their escape is impossible. This is similar to a Zhonyas. Both have roughly 2.5 seconds before you are able to target them. Use this time. \n\nQuestion 3. you are playing Azir, and you are being attacked by their team, 2 of them are in range of your soldiers but the ADC isn't and your Q is on CD do you:\n\nWatch your cooldowns and mana. Ideally you will have mana to pull off full combos. Look at where you are on the map. Look at where the enemy is on the map. Micro manage the cooldowns on your abilities with Azir and position yourself so that by the time your abilities are active you will be able to close in on the ADC. Think outside the box. By this I mean, think about possible pathways that include positioning from inside the lane to outside the lane to back inside the lane. e.g. You are in the lane. ADC is in the lane. You have X and Y in between. Move into the jungle then re approach the ADC from the jungle. \n\nQuestion 4. you are playing a champ like garen (i dont play him but he is useful for this example) his ultimate deals damage equivalent to missing health which means that at a certain percentage of HP you can execute any champ regardless of how much maximum hp they have, in a team fight do you:\n\nPlaying as Garen ideally you are a tank. Therefore there will be sufficient damage dealers on your team as well. Use your tankiness to get into the face of the enemy whilst the rest of your team hopefully capitalizes this initiation. Always go the carry if it's available to you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-03-20T03:23:29.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just looked at your match history, I highly recommend looking up builds and skill orders, that alone should help you out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spawnpk","date":"2015-03-20T03:07:33.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotta say I'm impressed with this guy.\nIf you want to run a few games I might be able to help.
