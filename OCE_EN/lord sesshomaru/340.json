This post was indeed inspired by the recent lunar revel skins, Warwick and Nasus in particular are just awesome skins. I am not Nasus&#039; biggest fan, but I can still appreciate how godly he looks wreathed in golden fire. \nThe look of the skins are great, which is obviously important, but what what really makes modern skins great (imo) is the immersion they have, putting players into the story of the skins, so you&#039;re not just playing a gold Nasus, you&#039;re playing the godly dog guardian of China. Previously this was only properly achieved with legendary skins, but now even normal skins are giving off this vibe. And for people like me who are really into stories and atmosphere/universe, this roleplay-esq approach to skins really enhances the fun of playing.\n\nSo credit where credit is due, 100%!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\n_(just waiting for year of the goat now, for my precious Kindred skin :P, and of course waaaaayyyyy in the future, an Aurelion Sol dragon one :P)_","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2018-02-10T06:28:26.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Skin quality has always been improving however I think these days we hardly get enough 975rp tier skins. I remember somewhere reading a Riot post saying they'd make sure that didn't happen yet here we are with the new standard price being 1350rp. Back then you could get a skin with a new model and new abilities for 975rp. That was a nice thing. Nowadays we get that but they also throw in a recall animation and/or dance and boom now its 1350rp.\n\nNot saying that adding in a new dance and/or recall animation doesn't make it worth more but I have two issues with them. First, whether a new dance and/or recall justifies the nearly 40% price jump from 975rp and secondly that having 1350rp be the new standard is really annoying because the 975rp skins both felt really good value for money as well as being easier to buy because 10 dollars of rp would cover it. Now you need to get more than 10 dollars at a time. Not a big issue but still annoying.\n\nAs for the whole skin \"thematic and lore\" parts to them I kind of just don't like it tbh. Not that there is anything inherently wrong with giving skins lore or their own universe but more the issue that it seems so many skins these days get released in \"skin lines\". I don't like having 15 Project (see young teen edgelord bait skins) or 10 Star Guardian (see anime garbage weeaboo bait skins) skins in the game. I feel like it means Riot brings out less original concepts (beyond the initial first set). I would like for every skin line to max out at 5 so they have to change it up. And frankly to have more solo skins because then they can really push the theme of it as far as it can go and specifically mould it to the champion it was made for.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-02-10T08:08:26.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree that there should be a fairly even spread of skins from affordable to expensive.\n\nThe price of the skin itself doesn't really bother me, I'll happily pay a little extra for a more interesting skin. What annoys me is all the little extras that get tacked on and really rack up the price like loading screen borders and limited chromas etc.\n\nIt does make it really annoying for collectors. Before you could pick up the whole lunar revel bundle for like $25, and it'd come with the 3 skins and an icon or ward. Now you literally can't pick up the whole lunar revel affair for less than $100+. (If you want the limited borders/red chromas/some of the golden chromas etc.) and not only is there no bundle to make it cheaper to buy in bulk, the new skins are also excluded from the hextexh crafting orbs.\n\nLoad screen borders used to be a little nod to people who bought the skin when it came out. Now if you want it, you have to buy a whole bundle of chromas (that you don't really want) and pay for the border itself. \n\nSo that's a little stink In my opinion, but at least the quality of the skins are so good. And the chromas themselves are actually decent and often change more than just the colours.\n\n-----------------\n\nI don't mind big skin lines as long as the champions fit within them thematically  (battlecast illaoi does NOT fit the battlecast skin line, neither does Star Guardian Jarvan etc.) but agreed it is good to have great stand alone skins too.\n\nWhat I do like about big skin lines is that you can make teams out of them and thats hard to do if they only have 5 champs and those champs may not even be the right roles (like pentakill)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2018-02-10T02:10:23.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Annie should get more skins.
