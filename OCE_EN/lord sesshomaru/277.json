But we gave them a hell of a good run for their money! \r\n\r\nWhen its so even like that i don&#039;t mind losing, it means that no one won because of stupid reasons like AFK&#039;s or broken champs, and it was just a straight up good game. But this loss tastes sour because if we had played that well against people our own level (Bronze and Silver) we would have won! But because we were against people who obviously had the skill to play at a much higher level, our good playing was wasted.\r\nI just cant help feeling kind of robbed.\r\n\r\nIm pretty sure that the plat player wasn&#039;t boosted either _(because I think they were actually a Rioter.)_ and people don&#039;t play worse as time goes by, (at least not to the extent that a Plat would drop into bronze.) So i wonder how it is that the system placed us together?\r\n\r\nMy friend was ADC that game (and is Bronze 3), and he told me that the Caitlin played far far better than the normal players he was used to vsing, and the matchup wasn&#039;t unfavourable either. (my friend is a very good ADC)\r\nThe plat and gold were also duo.\r\n\r\nI know that nothing will come of this post, but it still feels unjust. \r\ni dont know.. pointless post really.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-28T09:48:36.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rank does not mean nearly as much as your MMR does. If you are vsing them it's because your MMRs are similar, whether that's because yours is high or theirs is low it doesn't matter. They are in your games for a reason.\n\nThe meta shifts, one trick ponies lose their high ground and people who haven't played in a while get reset lower. So what if they were plat x seasons ago? They are in your games because they are of your approximate skill. In fact your post proved exactly that, because despite them being ranked higher you had a \"good even game\" which implies that your skill was similar.\n\nIt would be more unfair to put those ex plats/golds in a plat/gold only game if they are playing with a bronze/silver MMR. This is matchmaking doing it's job and doing it right, not screwing you over.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-28T10:13:23.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I know that, what I'm trying to say (quite badly) is that there is no real place for them.\n\nIf they aren't as good as other platinum players, then you cant put them there obviously, as it ruins not only their games, but the games of the other plat players.\n\nBut you can't really put them in bronze either.\nIts like how you wouldn't pitt an EX SAS solider against a 10 year old girl in a paintball fight. \nEven if they are \"EX\" SAS, (they WERE in plat, but aren't now) they've still done all the training and have performed at a high skill level, and while they might lack the 'edge' they once had when they were in the service, they don't suddenly forget how to be stealthy or \nhow to aim a gun. \n\nThis means they have a technical advantage over bronze players (who cant even remember not to 1v5 most of the time), but don't have the honed skill and reflexes required for platinum level games.\n\n(What if Faker came back to league after taking a few years break, would it be fair to match him against bronze players, just because he didn't have the 'edge' he used to?)\nYou cant justify putting Faker in challenger anymore because he wouldn't have the edge, but put him any lower down and his innate knowledge and experience will just stomp whatever elo he is in.\n\nThis just means that wherever they go, it causes trouble.\nIm not saying I have the solution (or that there even is a solution) \nbut I'm saying it is an issue.\n\nim not saying anything can or should be done about it, but I'm saying it is a factor.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LetsTwitch","date":"2016-12-28T08:54:15.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I expect less from these players.\n\nIf you were gold+ and are now vs'ing me in Bronze you clearly aren't that good. I've yet to see anyone who \"was\" ranked higher than me do better. It's pretty hard to drop down from Silver 5 0LP, so if you were gold and still did it anyway, I assume you're trolling or playing purely for fun, with no care for the game.\n\nMostly, if your friend lost, then instead of saying \"Whatever it's just because they're a higher rank\" they should focus on improving themselves. Imagine how easy the games will be if you were as good as plat players, instead of being content with beating those of equal rank.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-12-28T06:33:46.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"* good even game\n* playing against higher ranked players\n* not a total 25-3 by 20 minutes stomp like most games were the matchmaking system obviously failed.\n\ncherish it","replies":[{"poster":"FerrousOxide","date":"2016-12-28T08:50:46.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CHerish.\nToo often in my experance the Utomatcher puts 2-3 great players on one team and 2-3 complete scrublords/trolls on the other.\nI have been on both the winning an losing side of this automatch failure and  its not fun either way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-28T07:47:25.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, I suppose you're right. xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-12-28T12:23:17.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Boosted ring a bell","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-12-28T11:44:36.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean given what you said, they were probably boosted accounts that have since been slowly deranked during the seasons.","replies":[]}]}
