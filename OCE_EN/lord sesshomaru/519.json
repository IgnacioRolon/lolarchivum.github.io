(appreciation for the little things)","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since the removal of green wards, the only way you can hear the sound effect of your ward is by buying a pink or sightstone, (but unless you&#039;re a supp you probably wont get sightone and pinks are hard to buy once you run out of space for items) so most of the time you just hear the Trinket &#039;ding&#039; sound even though trinkets are &#039;normal&#039; wards now. and even if you have purchased a ward skin you still cant hear it, and seeming that trinkets are 90% of the warding you almost never got to hear your ward sound (and some of them have really cool sounds)\r\n\r\nbut now this has changed (as of this last patch i think) so thanks riot, its just a small quality of life change, but it is nice and makes ward skins that much better.\r\n\r\nGJ\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}
