Nothing Shen could have done could have saved Brand, short of falling on his knees and praying to whatever deity might listen for Ekko&#039;s computer to glitch, and there was nothing Brand could have done to avoid the situation, neither player was at fault, Shen couldn&#039;t mia because Ekko died and had just re-spawned, and teleport gives a pretty fair warning that someone is on the way. And brand wasn&#039;t out of position because he had just won a fight with Ahri (so he cant be expected to engage in a fight, win by the skin of his teeth AND end the fight with perfect positioning against a 2 man gank with champions with dashes at the end of it.) and had no way of knowing that Xin and Ekko would both converge on him.\r\n\r\nSo literally no-one made a mistake, so why is there the need for Brand to blame anyone when its so obviously no-ones fault?\r\n\r\nI just don&#039;t understand some people&#039;s thinking.","replies":[{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-04-26T04:45:46.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not sure why this post is downvoted. maybe the brand and xin read and downvoted this thread.\n\nanyway.. up you go +1","replies":[]},{"poster":"Im a CAT","date":"2016-04-26T04:06:24.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is never our  own fault, always blame  everyone else beside yourself.
