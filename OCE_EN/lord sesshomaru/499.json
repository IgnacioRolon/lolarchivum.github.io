I'm pretty sure he is anything but chilled. No all comedy aside, dragon cannot be affected by crowd control so of course it would be intentional for him not be able to be chilled. So next time you make a post like this take \"bug\" out of the title and just say possible bug because you may confuse people.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-07-07T12:36:01.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being 'Chilled' is not crowd control, the slow effect that comes from the 'Chilled' is crowd control. The dragon is still affected by Diana's moonlight and so Diana'a R gets to be Re-set, Gangplanks 'grog soaked blade' still works on the dragon I'm sure, its just the slowing factor that is removed, why isn't it the same for Anivia? Being 'chilled' and being 'slowed' are not the same, its the 'chilled' debuff that causes the slow, just like gangplanks passive. what i think has happened and why i think this is a 'Bug' is that the dragon's immunity should have removed the slow, but because the only effect 'chilled' has is the slow, the dragon's immunity has accidentally removed the whole debuff,\n\nremember that the 'Chilled' debuff is specific to Anivia alone, her E only does double damage to 'chilled' targets not 'slowed' targets, this means that while the 'chilled' debuf causes a slow, it is not a slow itself.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-07-07T08:08:31.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cos the dragon is not chilled k.\n\nThe dragon is always serious.","replies":[]}]}
