From what i was able to deduce over the years _(and I&#039;m no sherlock holmes)_ ARAM gives you a random champion too...\r\nits just as equally unfair in ARAM when the enemy team gets bliz and kat and all the pokey champs, and you get all the melee ones. Yet we all still play ARAM from time to time with no complaints. So why are you only complaining about AR URF and not about ARAM?\r\n\r\nYou can hardly complain about one and not the other, seeming they are pretty much the same.\r\n\r\njust because AR URF was released for the first time in history, and has been out for two days, doesn&#039;t in any way mean that old URF will forever never ever never be coming back, theres no need to be all protective.\r\n\r\nSo ffs just put a sock in it. \r\nDon&#039;t play the game modes you don&#039;t enjoy, and wait for the turn of the game modes you do enjoy.

That's what aram is, a quick, one lane match with random champions. AR URF is URF where you are forced into a random champ, whether you want to play him, or like him which is most likely than not weak in this game mode and you're stuck in a 20 minutes game of feeling horrible because not only are you getting smashed, you also have a champion you don't even want to play, and URF is ruined. URF was fine, people played whatever they wanted, even if you were losing, it was still fun, the current version is just a horrible 20 minute one champ carry.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-09-24T09:28:39.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yea.. no. its still the same as aram.\n\nIts quick\nIts random\nIts one champ carry\nYoure playing a champ you've never played\nThat champ sucks in that game mode\n\nyup.... sounds pretty identical to me\n\nAnd no, this hasn't ruined urf... its a different game mode. _(just like hexakill summoners rift and hexakill TT are different, and the two one for alls are different)_","replies":[{"poster":"Buttsubushi","date":"2016-09-25T10:25:57.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The power gap between good and bad champs is much worse, that is why people hate the random aspect.\n\nAlso we won't take you seriously if you post on the boards with a level 9 account.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-09-24T13:00:27.286+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"and yet you are complaining about people complaining lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-09-24T22:42:15.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yea.. but i never said that was wrong?\n\nThis post is about people complaining about AR URF, I'm not doing that.\n\nYour point?","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-09-25T02:24:40.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just don't see the point in you complaining about some people complaining about the game mode lol.
