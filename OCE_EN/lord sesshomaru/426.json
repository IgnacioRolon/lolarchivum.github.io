It&#x27;s really frustrating.\n\nI think I've got 3 or 4 games with her and the only time I do badly is if I'm versing someone like Katarina who has insane mobility and can just jump straight on me. I could have sworn Azir countered Orianna due to his better trading and zoning, but you just never know. I had no luck with Taliyah, either.\n\nThe recent AP item changes just made Ori so much worse to deal with.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-11T13:18:27.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea but champs with high mobility and damage like Kat kinda counter most champs anyway. :P\n\nThe thing with Azir is that he has to stand relatively still for his poke (WQ +2 autos), because he needs to auto.\nWhere as Ori can tap QW and then move away, and her spells will automatically activate when they reach the target location.\nThis means that she can move away from Azir's poke with no repercussions, but Azir cant really get away from hers without sacrificing his own damage. it's the same with champs like Ziggs and Xerath, anyone who can match his level of poke from a distance gives him grief, because he is a stationary target while poking, while all they need to do is chuck and run.\n\nObviously the longer the fight goes on, the more of an advantage Azir gets, as he is one of the few AP champions to be able to trade autos with Ori effectively. But she has so much damage the fight doesn't last too long.\n\nIf I had to vs Ori, as one of my mains, I would rather it be Taliyah, she is the one I'm best with _(probably because she is easiest)_ she is tanky enough to survive the first QW combo occasionally, arguably the most mobile of the 3, and her damage output is much burstier than Azir and Sol, so she can get rid of most of Ori's health before the next QW barrage.\nBut I still have trouble. \n\nYea, I despise that Banshees Veil gives AP now. I think that was a huge mistake, it gives power to all the wrong champions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-05-11T03:48:08.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play Syndra.

Tell him to focus on other lanes and get them ahead and just play safe. Bad and generic advice, I know, but that's how you deal with Heim. He can easily 1v2 early and mid game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2017-05-11T06:27:15.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He hasn't been picked anywhere internationally as far as I'm aware.
