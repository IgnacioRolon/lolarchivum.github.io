(serious point though)","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"The &#039;Dodge if you don&#039;t lock in&#039; system isn&#039;t working. We all see what you were trying to do, but lets face it, it wastes far more time than it saves.\r\n\r\nlets take a look at the maths:\r\n\r\nPeople tend to lock in with about 10 seconds to go. which means 100 seconds is saved per lobby. (thats 1:40)\r\nand a dodge happens every 2nd or 3rd lobby, which means between dodges around 3:20 is saved, but when someone does dodge, 10 people are placed back into the queue for around 3:00 each (if you have short queue times,) plus the wasted champ select time which is around 3/4 minutes each, that actually adds up to 1 hour of time wasted between the 10 people.\r\n\r\nand i know that you&#039;ll say &quot;its just temporary don&#039;t worry, once people are used to it, there wont be any dodges.&quot;\r\nWell it takes 3 weeks to break a habit, and 1 week to create a new one, and over a month has passed since this began, and accidental dodges are still commonplace, in other words: If people were going to learn, it would have happened by now.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nIt also affects other things like the bans, say the bans are blitz, Malphite, Zed, Jax, LB, and Lux.\r\nthen someone picks Udyr, but later on someone forgets to lock in and everyone goes back to square 1.\r\n\r\nthen in the next lobby, Someone realising that the Udyr picking summoner isn&#039;t on their team anymore and comes to the conclusion that its likely that they are now on the opposing team, decides that they don&#039;t want to play against that powerhouse of a jungler, and so they ban Udyr instead of LB.\r\nthis is unfair on 4 levels, 1 its unfair to the guy who wanted to play Udyr who now cant through no fault of his own, 2 its unfair for the guy who was on Udyr&#039;s team and now isn&#039;t, 3 its unfair for the team that had Udyr and now doesn&#039;t and its unfair to the team that banned LB but now she is open.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantages of the lock or dodge system wayyyy outweighs the advantages.\r\nTalk to the people who have huge queue times, I&#039;m sure they will all tell you that wasting 100 seconds in champ select, is far better than risking that 20 min wait again. (also if we factor the people who have 20 min waits into the maths, the amount of total time wasted goes through the roof)\r\n\r\nIts time to face reality, yes it was a good idea in theory, but in practice it just isn&#039;t working, and i for one would rather have 100 seconds wasted in champ select than 6 minutes wasted waiting again.\r\n\r\nSo lets admit to our mistakes, and think about retiring the system. Theres no use beating a dead horse just because you don&#039;t want to admit you shouldn&#039;t have swapped your old horse for the dead one.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nTL;DR:\r\n\r\nFor every 3:20 saved by the &#039;lock or dodge&#039; system, over 1 hour of time is wasted.\r\nthis isn&#039;t good.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-22T23:54:47.682+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not really about saving time, they're experimenting with shorter timers to do that. The lock in requirement is more about promoting engagement in select.\n\nIf you aren't engaged in select you may overlook the enemy or allied comps, you may forget to change summoners or runes/masteries. The sort of mistakes that result from people being afk/checked out in select. Being engaged in select also promotes teamwork and other positive behaviours because people will actually talk to their teams and pay attention.\n\nIt's about having better games. And really it's just one button to press. (Or two if you're banning).","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-02-23T05:08:50.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The sheer number of people dodging because they havent locked in a champion is proof that they arent engaged anyway, OR that they are so engaged that they forget to lock in their champion, either way the system doesn't work.\n\nyou will probably be more engaged if you don't have to sweat about being dodged because you left it an extra 5 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-02-23T10:19:55.961+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you still forget to lock in your ban or champion at this point in the season, there's something wrong with you. Plus, like Seras said, it's better for people to get engaged in the game ahead of them. There have been too many times where people in my games (including me) have forgotten to change their Runes and Masteries. This keeps them alert and ready for the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-02-23T23:56:49.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well there must be something wrong with a heck of a lot of people then because every second or third game is a dodge. I haven't yet forgotten to lock in myself, but I've been kicked from far too many lobby's because some other innocent person forgot to press a button.\n\nYou Say it keeps them alert, yet there are sooooo many accedental dodges still, that kinda proves that they aren't alert at all.\n\nAnd everyone has forgotten their masteries or runes occasionally, it happens, if you play 2000 games and for 20 of them you forgot masteries, that's not actually a big deal wouldn't you agree?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-02-23T13:06:28.950+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"End of the day either people learn or they lose LP.\n\nIt's not about efficiency it's about forcing people to participate in champ select instead of tossing on a champ and walking away.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-02-24T00:02:52.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well I'd say there's a lot more people losing LP than learning.\n\nAnd is forgetting to press a single button worth losing LP? Actually think about it for a second, you are certain to lose LP if you forget to lock in, but are not certain to lose it if you feed the shit out of your lane. Does that make any sense to you?\nYou are punished for looking away from your screen for 10 seconds, but only have a chance of being punished if you play really really badly. Is that really the game you want to play?\n\nRanked worked fine before this and it will work fine again after its gone. All it does is waste everyone time for no good reason when someone forgets to lock in.\n\nAnd you can't just toss on a champ and walk away, you still need to wait your turn to pick, and if you want to walk away those people will just lock in straight away and then walk away, it doesn't stop the walking away.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-02-22T23:21:33.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought it was something more along the lines of it takes 24 days to form a habit and only 7 to break it.
