I feel it's a deserved QoL change that we will have to get used to but one that we will be better off for in the long run.\n\nAs for the cast range, it aligns his E better with other mobility skills like Flash, Kha'Zix or Trist jump and also tends to make more intuitive sense. If you need to get the hell outta dodge but your screen isn't centred you don't want to have to be awkwardly running some more (time in which you could be damaged and lose your chance) before you actually move. If you're using it for engaging then you should have that extra second to ensure you are in range of where you want to end up (smart cast without indicators defs not recommended here tho).\n\nThat's my feelings anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Human Ryze","date":"2016-09-15T04:53:34.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cos balance.","replies":[]}]}
