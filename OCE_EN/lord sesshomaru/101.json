So I propose we (RIOT OCE and all of us) start thinking about how to grow our player base. Perhaps hire a few billboards in a few of the major cities, maybe a tv advertisement. \r\nI don&#039;t know about in Aussie but in NZ we have this really annoying &#039;Game of War&#039; advert campaign showing every 5 min&#039;s, I personally haven&#039;t had an interest in it, but it must be working otherwise they woulnt have the money to advertise, \r\n\r\nI&#039;m in my last couple of weeks of a graphic design degree, and I&#039;m sure there are lots of you that have similar skills, maybe animation, advertising, design, illustration, voice talent etc. so we as a community could create our own amateur ad campaigns for minor things like university/school magazines, or player made documentaries. \r\n\r\nAnd If RIOT wants to help out, perhaps something more proffessional for tv/billboards. It doesn&#039;t even need to be something new, some of the champion teasers would be perfect for drawing people in (after all drawing people in is what they are made for) ones like Tahm kench/vel&#039;koz/kalista/Azir/bard are perfect length for a tv ad, and all that needs to be added are the LoL/RIOT logos and a &quot;unleash the spear of vengeance on your enemies, you can download the game for free here:&quot; message at the end.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not sure how much a TV advert costs to run or how much a billboard hire is. But if RIOT OCE has those funds to spare for growing the player base then that&#039;s awesome! But If they dont then perhaps a community fundraiser could be an option,\r\nIdeas I have for this are:\r\n\r\nHave several OCE related skins on sale, outback renekton/veigar greybeard/cosmic reaver kassadin/pool party ziggs, And the proceeds go towards funding an ad campaign.\r\n\r\nAnd/or \r\n\r\nEnabling twisted treeline, draft pick, dominion, for a few days each, lasting a couple of weeks in total and having the battle boost random skin for your team button avaliable for each game mode with the proceeds going towards a TV ad.\r\n\r\nOr doing an oceanweek style thing where each win in that game mode gains points towards a final goal, with an icon or something on the way. \r\n\r\nThe way I see it, it&#039;s a win win situation, the community grows which means we get 3v3 etc and RIOT gets more players which means more money. \r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR: let&#039;s grow our community so we can play other game modes, through advertising league of legends on TV/billboards, and any smaller community created campaigns. \r\n\r\nLet me know what you guys think, and hearing from RIOT would be great! :)","replies":[{"poster":"LemonHunter","date":"2015-10-20T23:11:38.157+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"So my brain is still foggy from an operation, but I'll attempt to string some words together in the attempt that they will make sense. Bare with me.\n\nThis is a great idea and it is awesome to see more and more people in the community like yourself who are so passionate about League. There are quite a few things to keep in mind though when you start talking about advertising the game, and here are a few stand out ones.\n\n- When looking at Game of War (and yes, it's all over TV here in Australia too) it is a VERY different business model compared to League of Legends. Those kinds of games thrive of micro-transactions and time based gameplay which can be bypassed with micro-transactions. The monetary side of League is, to the most part, purely cosmetic. Those micro-transactions are usually quite heavily pushed in the casual, pick up put down game style of Game of War, and you would be surprised just how many people throw money at those mobile games. League is again very different, and since they don't push to have that type of money coming through, they don't necessarily have the advertising budgets like games such as Game of War have.\n\n- Keep in mind Riot's company  beliefs. Many companies, including Riot, don't put $$$'s first. They put players first. Mobile games like Game of War is purely a money making business. Don't get me wrong, every business is in the business of making money, or else they wouldn't be around, but it may not always be a top priority for all. Also, I know multiple companies who simply do not advertise through standard media or traditional methods because it goes against the company values. They may not want to spend time, effort and money on getting a higher number of people downloading the game, they may wish to put their time, effort and money into increasing the value to current players and leaving it open to people coming in on their own accord, not swayed by standard marketing techniques.\n\n- Sort of tying into the previous points, Riot have built a solid business model, and it clearly works. I personally would hate for them to change that way of thinking to go towards marketing through old media and by having a large advertising budget. When I buy skins (Gentleman Cho FTW) I want to see that money go towards awesome things like opening the OCE server, the epic OPL event in Sydney, the Worlds viewing at Hoyts that Riot have organised and to supporting the awesome Rioters around the world that put in such hard work every day.\n\n\nI would love to have a 3v3 ranked queue, I would actually play that seeing as I don't play 5v5 ranked. And again, internet high five to you for being so passionate and proactive in the community, it's people like you who make the community great. It's the community that will grow the community. I know when I first got into League of Legends, it's because a bunch of my friends were playing it on my old TeamSpeak server and they finally talked me into giving it a go. Showing people the game, showing how passionate you are and what the community can do is how more people will come to the game. This means, and yes I know it's obvious, but trying our best to do away with the stigma of the league community being toxic. That's another novel for me to write one day though.\n\nIt's obvious you want to help the community grow and that you have some awesome talents such as graphic design. Show people what you can do and what you're passionate about. Make some awesome League fan art! Put together something that shows why you love League, then share it with the internet. Who knows, you might just convince a few new people in OCE to join up to the server, getting us one step closer to that 3v3 ranked queue :)\n\n\nNow, remember everything I said is just my views, of course I don't know about the inner workings of Riot, but as a business owner, marketer and huge fan of League, that's what I think :). Thanks for reading my novel, hope it made sense.\n\n\n\nTL;DR\nGame of War focuses on only earning money, Riot focus on taking care of their players with awesome events. They have a business model which works and it would be terrible to see them change to having $$$'s their #1 priority. Talk to people about League, show your passion through your skills and get people to see exactly why League is such an awesome game.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-10-21T01:55:19.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea you make very good points there, some of which i hadn't even considered, thanks :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MasterMirkinen","date":"2015-10-21T00:38:38.636+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Lord Sesshomaru,\n\nfirst of all, thank you for this post, growing League is of course one of our priority for the exact same reasons you have mentioned (better matchmaking, potential more game modes...) and seeing post like this, makes us wanna do even more for you guys.\nAlso big thank you to LemonHunter who already touched some of the reasons we do not do TV advertising (some are correct some a bit less but really appreciate the advocacy for Riot being player focus and not $$ focused)\n\nSo, we agree that growing the playerbase is one of the priority we have in Riot Oceania (not the main one though, we still want to put 100% focus on the existing League players with activities like the one LemonHunter mentioned). What I think it is important to note is \"how to grow\".\n\nImagine you and 5 other friends are playing Soccer and you need 22 people (11 a side). You have tons of option to advertise your search of new players, some are more appropriate than others. Let's take couple of options:\n- Flyers at the supermarket\n- Flyers at the school\n- Flyers at the community centre (let's suppose there is a soccer field there)\n\nWhich one do you think has the chance to bring better players?\nWhich one you think it is more expensive?\nWhich one do you think it is more effective (number of players found divided by the cost)?\n\nThese are the kind of questions we are asking our self as well.\n\nBut this is just part of the reason we don't want to go to a broad media like TV.\n\nOne of the objective for our acquisition is to avoid having an influx of players that do not understand gaming at all. This would have a terrible impact to our community because players  like this would frustrate our existing players (feeding, not understanding how serious gaming is therefore afking...) and at the same time, not being hardcore gamers, these players will more likely leave league sooner. \nSo not only we would invest in players that won't stick to League but we will also have the potential of upsetting our existing players and they may leave as well. I believe this is what TV and Radio advertising would do.\n\nQuite the opposite would be focusing on media where both existing LOL players and other gamers are.\n\nHope this makes sense.\n\n-MM","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-10-21T01:54:30.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi :)\n\nthanks for replying to this, i completely understand all you have said, and i do see the merit in that, so if big media advertising is not an option, is there anything you can recommend that we as a community can do? obviously something to hit the right demographic that you are seeking.\n\neven if its just designing a few posters to put up in the game design building at Universities, it would be something for our community to come together to do. for example, i cant draw very well, but i can design a poster for a good drawing to be shown on, so perhaps if a player somewhere else in the region can draw well, there can be a collaboration and then we both have posters to put up at appropriate locations, the same could be done with people with animation skill, they could find a youtuber that has a bit of a reputation and could collaborate that way, these are just ideas, they probably aren't that useful, but it would be nice to see the community coming together for a common cause.\n\nthanks for the reply :)","replies":[{"poster":"MasterMirkinen","date":"2015-10-21T02:18:24.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think there is a lot we (Riot) can do to empower community advocates like you.\n_RiotConquisidor _and his team is working on this right now.\n_GeneralCoxy _is working on growing the playerbase from an advertising point of view.\n\nI'll try to ping them an see if they can be more specific.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-10-21T02:55:07.542+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Conquisitor","date":"2015-10-22T01:38:43.626+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Lord Sesshomaru\n\nIts great to see how passionate you are about the LoL Community, we're currently having a number of discussions about how we (Riot) might best support advocates like you.

Trying to get subs is like opening a new burger joint and trying to get customers from macs to buy your burgers... you might get a couple, but never enough to sustain.\n\n2) People who watch streams are mostly the people who play the game itself. They want some entertainment, learn something new or just another troll place from them to be. \n\nWith OCE being rather segregated from the rest of the world, I believe we have a large population of talent who is dying to be noticed. The ocean reef project is a good proof of that. The community was proud to be part of something special which the rest of the other LOL regions didn't have and the turn out was great! \n\nIf Riot could find a way to hold weekly tournaments for the community and stream it via twitch, youtube, in-game client this might help make the community more lively. Tournaments can be 5v5, 3v3 or Howling Abyss even. \n\nMechanics:\n• Weekly tourneys are based on sign-ups\n• Each week, players can sign up with XX amount of ip/rp for spots in the tourney\n• On designated days, the tourneys are held and winning player/team gets percentage prize pool.\n• Tourneys can be knockout format where each player/team progresses to the next round\n\nTourneys played can be broadcasted via in-game client/youtube/twitch depending on your budget for media.\n\nDoing this might help boost participation in the game as there is a reward system. Will also make the community more interactive as they watch and comment on the matches. Sure there will be trolls and toxic gamers but the chance of that will be lessen if they know they are being broadcasted. \n\nI believe that being the first region to create a reward base weekly tourney will draw more attention to LOL as well as players to the game.\n\nCheers,\n{{summoner:6}} Back to my search for caffeine...","replies":[{"poster":"Conquisitor","date":"2015-10-28T21:41:50.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Coldie\n\nYou raise a number of interesting points here: I'm not a tournament expert so I've shared your thoughts with the eSports Team.

I don't know about Australia, so I won't comment, but back when I studied at University, everyone was into online streaming. Heck, as a fellow New Zealander, you yourself would be aware that TV2/3 have On Demand services, which cater toward T.V shows that young adults find more attractive to watch. Therefore, I would imagine a LoL advert, aired on T.V wouldn't be hugely impactful. \n\nIf I really wanted to hit a target demographic, or start advertising, I'd look toward the University's first. It's where your demographic lies, its (I imagine), a demographic where steaming and so on is more popular anywhere else, it's a direct pathway into the \"Pro\" scene, and so on. If I really wanted to go \"all out\" on advertising, I'd try and establish a link between League of Legends players ---> Shared Interests and attempt to \"piggyback\" off that. Expo's like Armageddon (IIRC the Australian version is PAX?) is a good example of this.  \n\nEDIT\n\nWhoops just realised LITTLEMISSCHEEKY largely covered this :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"littlemisscheeky","date":"2015-10-23T00:41:48.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Lord Sesshomaru,\n\nThank you for your post! As I read it, I could see the passion you have for the game :) And the fact that you're being solution-orientated demonstrates your genuine motivation to see Oceania grow.\n\nSome of the guys here have already mentioned some very relevant points on how we approach problems/opportunities. And along with it, the types of questions we ask ourselves. In this post, I'm not going to try and respond to all the points you've mentioned, but rather share with you my personal experience as a \"former\" graphic designer. \n\nI went to uni (many years ago now) and graduated with a design degree majoring in graphic design. What I learnt coming out of uni was that it taught me the skills to take a brief and create a graphic solution based on set requirements. But what I wish it taught me was to ask important questions like:\n\n* Who is this actually for?\n* Is what I’m creating actually the right solution for the types of people it’s meant to be for? \n* Are there actually other solutions out there (beyond my job as a graphic designer) that would actually be more effective and impactful in achieving the project’s goals?\n* If I’m designing a flyer, does the audience I’m designing for even look at flyers?\n* If I’m to do advertising on radio, TV, a billboard etc. Have I asked, where does my audience actually spend most of their time? Do they even listen to the radio, watch traditional TV, or look at billboards? I’m personally not a big fan of traditional advertising as majority of people are spending less and less time on these mediums, and rather more and more on their mobile phones\n* Is anyone even asking these sort of questions before I get my brief?\n\nIn saying all of that, your experience could be very different from my own. But after the first few months coming out of uni, I realised that my job as a designer should start much earlier than when I open Photoshop if I wanted to make an impact.\n\nSo looping back to your example of “Game of War”, we could ask ourselves, “What is it about that game that makes TV advertising an effective medium for it?” \n“Does League of Legends fall into that category too?”\n\nHope that all made sense! \n\nP.S. Best of luck in the final weeks of your degree!","replies":[{"poster":"LemonHunter","date":"2015-10-23T01:55:54.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Out with old media, in with new media!
