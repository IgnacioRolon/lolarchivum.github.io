There are also a few gaps in your reasoning:\n- Veil is only going to stop the first ability. So, it will only stop Yasuo's ult if it has prevented his Q from landing, and if you don't get knocked up by other means.\n- This also means that the ability it would have prevented was Thresh's hook, not anything else.\n- You might get Armor/MR, but other people might have penetration.\n\nWhat champion were you using? What teammates did you have?
