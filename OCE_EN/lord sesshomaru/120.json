That is the utopian team.\r\nYou can then mix it up a bit, maybe take away the support and add another tank if they have a lot of burst damage, or take the mage away and put an assassin in, if they have a lot of sustained damage. Maybe play it risky and have no tank and 2 fighters and try end the game early. \r\nThat is strategy.\r\n\r\nBut picking 3 assassins (even more if you have vayne ADC)  just because that class is just straight up better than all the others, is a pathetic way to play the game.\r\n\r\nFizz should NOT be able to take a tank, just like ADC&#039;s should NOT be able to take Fizz. \r\nZed should NOT be able to 1v1 Illaoi, just like Janna should NOT be able to 1v1 Zed.\r\n\r\nevery class needs a weakness, Assassins currently have none, their armour pen shreds tanks/fighters, and the passive damage they get from items alone is more than enough to destroy any squishies on the map.\r\n\r\nBut it turns out that Fizz CAN take tanks with ease, as well as destroying ADC&#039;s in under a second.\r\nZed CAN 1v1 illaoi as well as killing Janna instantly.\r\n\r\nRengar legit just jumps into battle and spams Q as fast as he can until everyone is dead.\r\nFizz has so much AoE damage, he doesn&#039;t even need to select a target, he just throws all his abilities into the fray and takes whatever he gets.\r\nAnd Kha&#039;Zix is literally impossible to fight in 90% of situations.\r\n\r\nI am legitimately begging, please, please, please, can we just have a normal game.\r\n\r\nLike pokemon! \r\nFire counters Grass, Grass counters Water, Water counters fire. Its a circle.\r\nEveryone has a strength, and a weakness.\r\n\r\nThere is no fuckin circle in league! \r\n**Mages** counter ADC&#039;s, but are countered by Tanks, Fighters and Assassins.\r\n**ADC&#039;s** counter tanks, but are countered by Mages, Fighters and Assassins.\r\n**Fighters** counter Mages, ADC&#039;s,tanks, and counter the occasional unlucky assassin.\r\n**Assassins** counter ADC&#039;s, Mages, Supports, Tanks, and sometimes fighters, and don&#039;t really have a counter except for a few fighters.\r\nThats a little lop sided if you ask me.\r\n\r\nAnd the line between assassin and fighter is so blurred now that i bet even RIOT no longer knows the difference.\r\n\r\nWhy not make Assassins = Charmander, Mages/ADC&#039;s = Bulbasaur, and Tanks = Squirtle? \r\n\r\nPokemon, an 8 bit game from the 90&#039;s has more balance than league.\r\n\r\nIm a mid-lane mage main and its just a one sided slog against assassins every game.\r\nThe only mages we see in league now, are the few that faker played in words... \r\nThat it. Its just sad.\r\n\r\nEven the powerhouse mages like Vel&#039;koz, Lux and Brand, we don&#039;t even see anymore, they are just outclassed by the assassins.\r\nAre you genuinely happy with the state of the game?","replies":[{"poster":"NoMoreChillies","date":"2016-11-22T10:26:50.679+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Good points\nAssassins need a weakness","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-11-22T15:42:11.405+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"They have a weakness.\n\nCC.\n\nLiterally every single last one of those \"opie op\" assassin champs that people bitch about are shut down hard by well cc.\n\nTake akali before she got nerfed into the ground, i have almost 1000 games with akali so i like to think i know her ins and outs, and quite frankly she was always a super strong pick into teams that have no hard cc, but if i saw a lux or a morg, or hell a nautilus on the enemy team? i was almost scared to pick akali into a team like that (again before rito nerfed her till shes unplayable, still waiting for that passive reversion rito, you can keep all the other nerfs just give us back our passive) because quite frankly one morg q and it didnt matter how far ahead i was 9/10 i was dead if the enemy team followed up on said morg q.\n\nHell even the argument of \"well how can i outplay it if i die instantly\" simple, dont put yourself in a situation where you can die instantly, surround yourself with your team, if there is one thing assassins hate more than anything its having to traverse a mine field of CC just to reach their target.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-11-22T22:40:53.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"\"Hmmm i know how to counter them! we stop them from being able to attack or move!\nsurely thats a **_unique_** counter for assassins.

Basically, if you are in range to attack minions, YOU ARE AT RISK OF DYING.\n\nAlso i have no idea what your bitch about alkali is, I play alkali just fine now, and Im not even an Akali main. \n_(remember her purpose is to burst down a SINGLE target, not to jump into a fight and get a pentakill, she's an assassin not a fighter, and if you cant burst down an ADC or mage as alkali, theres something majorly wrong with you.)_","replies":[{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2016-11-22T22:58:02.332+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assassins have unique weaknesses that we, the players, need to exploit.\n\n{{champion:84}} : Tank Akali nerfed, so you can just kill her easily\n{{champion:245}} : Avoid Timewinder and predict where his zone is going to land and play safe when his ult is up.
