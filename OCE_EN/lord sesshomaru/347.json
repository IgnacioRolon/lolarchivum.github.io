I think that somehow _(likely with the installation of the new client, i would guess)_ this system is no longer functioning correctly.\n\nI think that its a real problem, but with such an easy solution.\nIt has been fixed before, It shouldn&#039;t be too hard to take another look at it now?\n\nas proof that the system is no longer working as it once did, I have attached a picture of my champion select chat in a couple of recent games, accompanied by my friend&#039;s chat in the same 2 games. \n\nMy friend called jungle both games. In game 1, he called jungle first on his screen, but on mine it said that the other person had called first. In game 2, he called jungle first, and it didn&#039;t even register in my chat at all. \n\nSo i thought id bring this to attention here. Is anyone else experiencing similar problems?\nWhat are your thoughts on the problem?","replies":[{"poster":"BlazedTornado","date":"2016-12-20T07:44:32.317+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This happened to me as well and it is really aggravating not getting your role and the chat is filled with spam copy paste of the chat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-12-21T12:24:24.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This wouldn't be an issue if we just had FUCKING NORMALS DRAFT NOT FUCKING BLIND PICK NO ONE LIKES","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-12-20T11:04:13.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">It has been fixed before, It shouldn't be too hard to take another look at it now?\n\nThere's no point looking at it.\n\nJust give us normal Draft (or whatever new champ select is) instead of normal blinds and it will fix the issue.\n\nThe only issue that is occurring is that blind pick exists.","replies":[{"poster":"Derikay","date":"2016-12-20T11:47:11.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Valor Carrys,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=eLQgA141,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-12-20T11:04:13.099+0000)\n>\n> There&#x27;s no point looking at it.\n> \n> Just give us normal Draft (or whatever new champ select is) instead of normal blinds and it will fix the issue.\n> \n> The only issue that is occurring is that blind pick exists.\n\nRiot has removed normal draft from most servers.

Anyway, I believe (keep in mind this is my own opinion here) that it is partially to do with the delay between peoples computers and the server, no matter what chat function you use your messages will often come up first on your screen (this is because at the time your device doesn't know of the possibility of the other message). Then upon receiving the message it will change the order after a while according to the servers timestamps (not your own), however League doesn't do this thus having people argue over calling roles first. Doesn't explain the missing ones though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-20T04:49:21.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To add an anecdote:\n\nI was in a dispute recently over a lane. It clearly showed on my screen that I got it.\nBut this other guy kept insisting that he got it, I lost the game of chicken and grudgingly switched to support before the timer finished. \n\nI was unimpressed, and for the first few mins did internally hold a grudge, But this guy's actions were not that of the typical lane-stealer _(Locking in Riven, no communication in champ-select, spews out some illegible 'teenage english' in /All chat on first blood, spams lvl 7 mastery all game, and never speaks or pings again.)_\n\nHe wasn't like that, he was an upstanding player, complimenting and advising the team, admitting his own mistakes etc. And he did say later on in the game \"Im sorry Taric (me), I truly would have gone support if I thought I didn't get the lane.\" I told him of course that it was ancient history and all was good.\n\nSo I am now convinced that we both saw our names first on the call _(which isn't supposed to happen)_. I did honour him at the end for being an upstanding player, and on top of it all managed to get my 2nd lvl 7 Taric token, as a bonus to a great game. \n\nBut I have seen so many lane disputes recently definitely NOT go as smoothly as that. Double jung has been a frequent occurrence, on top of countless requests to report certain players for stealing lanes, and inter-team fighting. \nJust because of a small loading error in champ select.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2016-12-20T10:07:01.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the moment I read \"Taric (me), I truly\"\n\nI thought it would say \"I am truly, truly, truly outrageous\"","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-20T10:45:18.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A missed opportunity! xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-12-20T05:59:00.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's worse when people rage at getting autofill in ranked and hold you to ransom over the lane you got.
