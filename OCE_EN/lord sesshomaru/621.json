This isn&#039;t the first time its happened.\r\n\r\n(also theres the age old Syndra bug (which still hasn&#039;t been fixed i might add) where her ult CD doesn&#039;t have a timer, just the number, which is incredibly misleading)\r\n\r\nIn the picture, you can clearly see me holding the spheres (meaning my W is active as we speak) you can see the duration of the &#039;sphere holding&#039; period in the buffs/debuffs section, and you can see that my W has been on cooldown the whole time and still has 2 seconds left, as well as seeing the ultimate CD timer.","replies":[]}
