Sorry for the repetition but I believe the community has a right to know why they are being charged extra.\r\n\r\n______________________________________________\r\n\r\n**Why is Karma's bundle more expensive than other champions?**\r\n\r\nKarma's bundle:\r\nKarma\r\nSkin (1350)\r\nIcon\r\nBorder\r\n\r\nPrice: 2000\r\n\r\nNidalee's Bundle:\r\nNidalee\r\nSkin (1350)\r\nIcon\r\nBorder\r\n\r\nPrice: 1900\r\n\r\nYeah, it's for charity, I know. Cool, that's really nice. Very generous.\r\nBut why is it more expensive?\r\n\r\n100% of the proceeds are going to charity anyway, so why does it need an extra charge? Are we paying more for the privilege of it being a charity skin?\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, of course I'm happy to support charity with my purchase, I think thats great! (I've bought every charity skin/icon etc. to date, even the ones I didn't want and don't use.) But I still do want to know what I'm paying for.\r\nWhat is that extra 100 RP for? If there is a valid reason for it (I.e. covering the cost of transferring the money to the charity, or legal fees etc.) I'm happy to pay, but if it's just randomly tacked on 'just cos we can get more than usual from you cos it's charity.' then that's underhanded and goes against the principles of charity in the first place, and I'm not so comfortable supporting that kind of attitude.\r\n\r\n(This is not a rhetorical question btw, I would really like an answer here please. What is the extra 100RP for?)\r\nThank you","replies":[]}
