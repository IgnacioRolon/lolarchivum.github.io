A proper lane where no-one burst down the other in 0.1 seconds, or shadow-dashed to safety from a &quot;guaranteed&quot; tower-death. But instead just thew spells at each other, traded damage, took CS, denied CS, fought, retreated, engaged, killed, and died.\r\n\r\nit was glorious! \r\n\r\na lane where for once, making a small mistake didn&#039;t cost you your life, a lane where when there was a full on fight, both parties still had enough HP to continue with the lane afterwards. A lane where no BS was called from ether side.\r\n\r\nPower vs Defence!\r\n\r\nAP vs MR!\r\n\r\nNew vs Old! \r\n\r\nDragon vs Golem!\r\n\r\n\r\nI just wish others could take a break from the constant monotony of Crit swordsmen, and Shadow assassins, and experience the bliss of a true uncorrupted mid lane, the way it was meant to be!","replies":[]}
