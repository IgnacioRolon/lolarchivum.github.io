It comes down to one very simple thing: using the spell with the constraints I put on it in the interest of game health proved too frustrating for too many people. I made a bet that most players would be able to accept these constraints (particularly the lock-out delay), and I was wrong. So we're changing it!\n\nBut yeah I'm no the expert here and you can find full reasoning and context there.\n\nAlso @ IndianGamer - \"Let’s be clear on one thing: removing this lockout is really powerful (like, Taliyah’s probably crazy as a result). Having witnessed some of the resulting shenanigans during testing, we’re taking pre-emptive measures to soften the best-case of her now much-more-reliable ‘Seismic Shove + Unraveled Earth’ combo. Things might be rocky for a while, but we’re confident that smoother Stoneweaver gameplay paves the road for a balanced Taliyah in the long-term.\"\n\nBy making W Vector instead of having the lock out players are now able to cast W and then E giving their opponents even less time to react to the ability (before you had to cast E first). Because of this increase in strength and reliability of hitting the abillity we had to reduce the damage on the W into E combo.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-13T04:02:26.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Question for you Maraudaur, do you know how long enemies are actually gaining vision of the W cast?\n\nI feel this is an important question, because i feel like in higher elo's you have actually removed a metric shit ton of Taliyah's counterplay.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-07-13T04:09:01.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not actually sure atm.

I'm the gameplay designer who worked on Taliyah. It would have been reasonably easy to make a vector cast that allows for knockup if you didn't move your mouse too much, but I was worried about false positives here; I'd need to give the spell some leeway (as in, you never move your mouse exactly 0 units) and that might screw over people who are trying to push enemies in a direction but don't move their mouse too much.  So I'd be worried about that.\n\nBut on a higher level, the knockup was very much an artifact of the old cast type. I asked myself \"what should happen if the player does not press the button a second time?\" and knock up seemed like the safest way to go (I considered knock-away too). Now that that's no longer a thing, I'm happy to not have the knock up on the ability anymore. It makes it clearer to learn playing against Taliyah as well. W will always shove you in a direction; that makes it easier to grok what options she has.\n\nThat answer your question?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-07-15T23:37:47.713+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi ZenonTheStoic\n\nFirstly congratulations on Taliyah! I think she is a fantastic champion! Keep up the good work ^^\n\nOk do i see what you mean about different people having larger or smaller mouse movements, that makes sense. \nNow that you explain why the knock up existed in the first place, i can understand it not being there anymore, i think its a shame that there should be less Variety of options in her kit however (_Much like how Azir over time just keeps losing all his interesting features and utility [Attack Speed CDR passive] [E Knockup] [Ult Duration] [W damage on turrets] etc etc. in favour of just becoming a sheer damage machine, which is so much less fun_) \nAzir is my main with Aurelion Sol and now Taliyah close behind, and i would hate Taliyah to head in Azir's new direction, (so you can understand my hesitation on the removal of the variety on the knock up) but now that you explain it, it puts my fears at bay a little.\n\nI still don't think vector casting was the right move, I believe you were right in the first place, I like many others quickly accepted the lockout and became very fast and accurate with her W and id love to see it return. But I think after all the fuss about changing it to vector, its unlikely it'll be changed back now.\n\nI will always be the first to ask for the old W back (and I'm hopeful theres enough overall feedback to convince you), but if it is 100% not coming back, would there be the possibility of adding a 'particle size' indicator to the new vector cast system? Just having a small directional indcator coming out of nowhere feels weird, it would be great to have a circular indicator (like the old w had on its first cast) from which the directional indicator originates from. \n(_and or, making it so casting it outside of max range causes it to be cast AT max range. instead of making Taliyah path to the position you cast it at in order to make it in range, that would make it so much faster, and be so much less frustrating._)\n\nIn any case, thanks so much for taking the time to explain it to me, i really appreciate that!\nand congrats again on great work developing The Stoneweaver!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-07-15T01:42:10.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So in your example it sounds like it would be better to shift them towards the arrow (get stunned slightly faster while removing their ability to flash away...if you hit W)\n\nSo it looks like it was an intentional change.
