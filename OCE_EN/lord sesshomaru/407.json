Having to use both means he has to be in the battle for more than a split second, and that just leaves too much of an opening for those pesky immobile champs to escape. \r\n\r\nI think the jump is fine though, no need to change that. \r\nMaking sure that his long range gap-closer engage is also his escape, works pretty well. I mean it&#039;s a bit clunky as you do actually need to get a kill or assist for it to reset, which is real hard when you can 1-hit tanks, but i suppose can live with that disability, for now at least.\r\n\r\nHe should be tankier too, I mean he&#039;s a damage champ right? So it wouldn&#039;t really be fair if he was squishy as well, I feel like that&#039;s something meant exclusively for mages and ADCs, and I wouldn&#039;t want him to steal their uniqueness. Better add even more defences and life-steal to his kit/items to make doubly sure he doesn&#039;t get mixed in with that lot.\r\n\r\nIm also really glad that red wards cant see him anymore, what a relief, it was just so oppressive to his playstyle! Just like Shaco, That 3.5 seconds of passive invisibility can&#039;t possibly be used for ganking, so I&#039;m glad it classifies as &#039;in-combat invisibility&#039; now. \r\n\r\nSo can we see some love for Kha please? \r\nIm sick of having to share the enemy jungle with the enemy jungler, it&#039;s too much of an inconvenience having to kill them instantly whenever I run into them, sometimes I even have to jump over walls to get them after they use flash to escape. Such a time-waster...\r\n\r\nAnd don&#039;t get me started on having to wait for my Q cooldown when fighting them alone in their own jungle, so frustrating. Ugh..\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-12-26T22:40:22.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I’m getting a vibe that you don’t like kha","replies":[]}]}
