Previously it actually had a much longer and faster dash that could go through walls and had a shorter cooldown and even though the damage was less, it was super overpowered. I feel a damage nerf and maybe a cooldown increase is the way to go now since the dash isn't actually that impressive as it is.","replies":[{"poster":"Eimer Troll","date":"2016-11-01T09:21:36.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like they will be nerfing the damage for multiple bolts hitting the same champion.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-11-01T00:53:21.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"protobelt is overpowered, especially in korea where it's on literally every build. I feel the biggest issue with it is it's flexibility, since it offers 'gapcloser', 'waveclear', 'another spell worth of damage', and 'decent stat efficiency'. All of this on an item active that's actually pretty short cooldown of 40s.\nI love this item but I also feel that it's way overbuffed and so long as the mobility and decent stat efficiency remained I would still buy it sometimes.\n\nInterestingly enough, though I haven't seen any nasus mains running it; I love to go:\n{{champion:75}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3152}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3111}} \n\nThe protobelt active bypasses alot of nasus's lategame weakness of being kited and lets nasus get right into your face. Thanks to his increased mobility he can also use the randulins active really well so that he can just rush through enemy lines to delete the squishies. The protobelt also offers him some cdr though it's from the kindlegem component so it makes the build path awkward to not stack with spirit visages kindlegem. Also even though he doesn't really need it, the ap makes his spirit fire hurt just a little bit more during teamfights and it still offers a decent amount of tank stats. If your team needs a hard tank, then maybe this build isn't good but if you get a passive laner and you can get ahead early, then nothing is scarier to that immobile carry than a 1000 stack nasus WITH MOBILITY. Also the Protobelt does alot of base magic damage in of itself with it's own ap factoring into it's damage scaling.\n\nAssassin Nasus, It's a troll build but it's a fun troll build.","replies":[{"poster":"UseIess","date":"2016-11-01T07:53:25.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well i guess you havent seen sirchez's protobelt DCANE. hes been doing it since release of the item.
