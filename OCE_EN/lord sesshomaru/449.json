Almost no hesitation. _(i honestly don&#039;t know where the mana came from)_\n\nShe would average like 7 - 8 spears a minute I kidd you not, and very time she threw one, as soon as it left her hand, she&#039;d instantly transform into cougar mode in preparation. _(often looking rather foolish and overconfident in her throws, when they didn&#039;t land)_\n\nShe would also sit in the bush most of the time _(often missing farm)_, because she knew that missiles coming out of the bush aren&#039;t visible until WAYYY after they have left the bush _(should probs be fixed btw)_.\n\nBeing GP _(a fast champ)_ and a mid lane main _(used to skillshots)_ I was able to fairly easily dodge the vast majority of them.\n\nBut on the odd occasion that one did hit: instant **FLASH + POUNCE + EVERYTHING = DEAD!** Instantly!\nLike not even enough time to press W for my oranges. Legit _instant_ death. Despite being ahead, having more farm, and better items.\n\n100% hyper-agressive, focusing on nothing else _(her first kill on me was under my tower and she threw the spear from the bush, and burst everything even summs (while low) to get me, just to give me the tower kill seconds after)_.\n\nIt was incredibly frustrating, managing to dodge 95% of her spears, and then get absolutely demolished when finally one hits.\n\nSo lane phase ended, I had like double her farm, and I couldn&#039;t do a damn thing.\nSo frustrating, I didn&#039;t know what I was doing wrong. :S\n\nend of narrative xD","replies":[{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2017-05-16T07:30:48.994+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being a GP main [you'd know ;)] it's kinda essential to remember that you're a squishy. If you build TobiasPlank, you'd go TriForce, IE, Ghost blade, PD, Statikk Shiv and a Last Whisper item. That's basically no defensive stat whatsoever.Your build, you had TriForce, IE and Statikk Shiv. \n\nNidalee's kit is all about hunting, correct? So, thematically, it made sense to give her abilities that made her feel like a hunter/duelist champ. If I'm correct, her Cougar Q is Takedown, an ability that literally deals more damage to low enemies. Her spears deal more damage with range. She can lay down Teemo-Caitlyn traps (don't we all love that?). And she has a sustain. Honestly that seems quite unfair ESPECIALLY when she's meant to be a Jungler, not a top laner.\n\nAnd last off, let me lay down some GP advice (i know i was sub-par those games, decent at best but hear me out). Always run Thunderlords, better burst more damage. Always go Ghost blade second (Caufields first) as you need the CDR and the AD + Lethality is a nice bonus. Don't be afraid to pop barrels for the movement speed boost as you can kite with it. Barrel bushes for surprise chains (and vision). Use Ult to 'assist' teammates.\n\nYour boosted pal, StealthVortex88","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-16T09:01:17.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the good advice! I must admit I was more familiar with the old gangplank than the new, _(but I did binge play the new one to lvl 5 when he came out XD)_, but I have my eyes on his Dreadnova skin, so I'm trying to get my playing up to scratch in order to warrant me buying it xD haha\n\nYou were on fire that second game if i remember correctly! haha \n\nI think why I was surprised was because I'm used to the mid lane, where _(unless your name is Fizz)_ you have to trade some skillshots first before going all in for the kill. So I was caught off guard when did could 100-0 me ten when behind haha. xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-05-17T23:45:27.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who still loves to play nid mid. I can somewhat understand how frustrating those spears would be. A lot of her damage is based around the spears and the mark those and the traps give. \n\nYou usually have to be careful with her mana though. Was she building mana items? I imagine the top bushes were a pain in the ass\n\nI haven't played against a nidalee in ages but I can tell you what tends to work against me when I'm playing here. Which is stay among your minions to ruin her aim with the spears. Once she's throws it, if she's misses trade aggressively. A ton of her damage in cougar comes from the mark empowered q, without it you should win the trade. If it hits get the fuck outta there. If she's running ignite (which i always do) a good spear + cougar combo + ignite will kill you. The other thing is mobile champs. Ez drives me nuts when I'm Nid. So the reason you probably had so much trouble was that gp isn't great at either of those things.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-17T23:58:15.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats good advice! thanks \n\nI don't think she did build mana, she rushed ludens.\nMaybe mana runes? i dont know.\n\nyea I was usually behind minions, but sometimes (like when vsing blitz) there isn't much of a choice when theres only half a wave of your minions left and the enemy can just come round in the bushes behind you and zone you, so you either take a spear (or pull) to the face, or you miss farm.\n\nYea GP's lack of dashes might have been a big problem for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-05-18T00:08:23.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup and that's where I get most of my kills when people are trying to be clever with only a couple of minions to protect then. That or they stay to long and get sniped. \n\nI think you could have gotten away with one or the other. But gps weak early trading and low mobility will make it difficult. I'd say your only real choice is to farm under tower and ask the jungler for help. Once you do good damage you'll be fine, as long as you don't take the spear. She needs that mark to blow people up really, unless she's mega fed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HaveYouSeenMyCat","date":"2017-05-17T09:38:37.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dude if you think that's frustrating try going up against a nid support that only builds dmg. one second you're passively farming minions next one spear chunks half your hp and have a cougar up your ass not even having a chance to kite, then if you manage not to die you have to back incase another spear comes out of nowhere.\nlike i get shes an assassin but the spear range is too damn far.","replies":[]}]}
