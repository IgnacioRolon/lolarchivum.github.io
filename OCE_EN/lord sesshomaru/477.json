This exact scenario has happened to me many times now, along with other similar ones like for example failing to land the Q slow to save a team member because the soldier veered out of the way.\r\n\r\nI have included a video illustrating my point, in the first instance 2 soldiers are on the field and then the third is summoned in front of Azir and Q is activated right on Lee sin, The soldier closest to Lee (and the last one summoned) dashes on an angle to allow room for the other soldiers to come in and as such misses Lee altogether and Lee sin simply walks out of the way of the others which take longer to arrive which means that having multiple soldiers on the field actually disadvantages Azir, The replay in slow motion is to demonstrate that the closest solder stops movement before Lee Sin even starts to move and you can tell by its range circle that had it gone where the curser was it would have struck the killing blow on Lee, The second scenario shows the same thing but with only 1 soldier (and lee was already running from the start) and you can see the soldier reached him and killed him due to it not moving out of the way for the other ones. this shows that having multiple soldiers on the field can be a major disadvantage which doesn't seem right to me seeming he depends on them so much, he shouldn't have to regulate how many soldiers he uses during a fight just so he has the option to chase afterwards, he should have to regulate them because of soldier charges and mana but not because he can't chase with multiple soldiers.\r\n\r\nIt seems common sense to have the closest soldier to the destination take the middle (optimum) position, but seeming that isn't the case there must have been a reason that wasn't implemented that i am unaware of\r\nand i was wondering what that is? but if there isn't a reason and it turns out that it was just an oversight or a bug could it please be mentioned to someone who could consider the change?\r\nthat would be much appreciated thanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2014-12-24T03:19:57.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wouldn't logic tell you to adapt to the mechanic?\n\nI mean you clearly know it exists as you made this massive ass post on it, just adapt to it and send your soldiers wide.","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-24T03:22:22.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"which soldier goes where changes, from when i tried it.\n\ni do think its first to a spot goes on the right tho....","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2014-12-24T23:16:40.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When i'm home from putting up with family on christmas i will test it, i would have thought the logical order would be that it's spawn order right to left.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2014-12-25T05:25:48.736+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would think logic would dictate that first to a position takes the middle (like it does with just 1 soldier)","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2014-12-25T14:47:16.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really, from a programming way of doing stuff, that would be more complicated then right to left.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2014-12-26T01:46:44.371+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We aren't talking about programming issues we are talking about Logic \nIf you have a triangle shaped container and drop 3 marbles into the container at different times the first one in takes the middle position closest to the point of the triangle. its up to the programmers to make that happen, if the game was based around what is easiest for the programmers then there wouldn't be much of a game.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2014-12-26T04:53:17.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because these are totally marbles going into a triangle, fact is this how it works, play around it.\n\nThe logic of right to left in spawn order makes sense to me, and is easier to program, having it be closest in the middle holds no logic because then we go into logistics that are horse %%%% (2 are the same distance, which goes where.)\n\nI'll agree for convenience sake it's not a good thing, but it wouldn't be that hard to play around anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2014-12-26T06:47:40.565+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the first to a position goes to the right, why does it not go to the right when there is only one soldier?

Obviously\nbut the logic is the same, the first marble finds its way closest to the point (using the laws of physics) so why doesn't the soldier work the same?\nthe first soldier to the finish line, goes closest to the aiming point? that makes sense to me. (difficulty in programming, shouldn't matter, they overcame putting the whole champ into the game, whats a few tweaks?)\nand anyway i have done a small little bit of programming myself and if you cut big corners like this just to make it easy for yourself then you aren't really committed to the final result are you?\n\nand yes its not hard to learn around it (and i already do to some extent) but he is complex enough already without having to judge this as well, its just un-nessasary, when it could work like his normal WQ combo. \n\ni see your reasoning but it doesn't make sense in my mind, millions play this game and hundreds program it.\ndoes it make sense to make it easier for the hundreds or the millions?\n\nyou mention that 'if two are the same distance away where do they go?'\nwhen it comes to programming this complex a situation with such large numbers the two soldiers are almost never going to be EXACTLY the same distance away down to a decimal point value. the chances of that are astronomically small, and even if they did happen to be exactly the same then the closest one to the left goes to the left or vice versa. its not too hard to imagine.\n\nhow exactly are the logistics horse %%%%? you make a statement but don't give evidence to back it up\n\nif you are running a race and you are first to cross the line are you going to veer off to the right and cross the \nline there??","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-01-07T22:42:22.231+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think these changes have now made their way to the PBE\nim not sure if its official but hopefully it is and will make its way into the patch.","replies":[]}]}
