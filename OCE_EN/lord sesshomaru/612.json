Through leveling up all I've earned so far is a bunch of champion shards for champions I already own and other random champions that I don't want or are too expensive to turn into permanent shards. The amount you get from disenchanting is bullshit, a 3150 BE champion can be disenchanted for 1350 BE, and a 6300 BE can be disenchanted for 3150 BE. I've gotten 1 6300 BE champion so far, that was the ONLY time I earned a decent amount of BE from a level up.
