Also like many players unfortunately Im not exactly oozing positivity when it comes to the current state of the game. Thats my bad and I regret that, I don&#039;t mean to add negativity to the boards, or make anyone uncomfortable. So Im probably not everyone&#039;s favourite volunteer :S\nand I sincerely apologise if I rustle any feathers with this post, however I feel it is important to make a serious post like this at this time, considering the current vibe and theme of the boards.\n\n_______\n\n#The Hot Topic\n\nThe theme of course is the player behaviour system, and its impact on the game. The boards have been rife with talk about the apparent and drastic increase in severity that people have been feeling when it comes to the harshness of punishments. The community seems fairly split, taking different sides when it comes to the _&quot;That offends me, stop it.&quot;_ and the _&quot;Suck it up, it&#039;s the internet.&quot;_ discussion.\n\nWe have had lots of posts, some heated, some not, many with very different viewpoints, and all with good points to make.\nBut thus far I don&#039;t think we have talked about the underlying principle behind the whole topic, and what it actually means for the community and for league. So that is what I am wanting to talk about here.\n\n_______\n\n#Security or Freedom\n\nThis is essentially the subtext of the whole player behaviour conversation, and the point of this post.\nWe all want to feel safe and secure, free from prejudice and criticism, and we all want the freedom to do what we want without restrictions. This is even more true on the internet, a world where we want to, _(and can)_ be pretty much whatever we want. Unfortunately the two are completely inverse of each other. Greater security comes at the loss of the freedom, and greater freedom comes at the loss of the imposed restrictions of greater security. \n\n**Quite simply, we can&#039;t have both.**\n\nYou cant put a heavy roll cage on your car, AND make it faster. \nNo matter what you say or how mildly you meant it, there will always be someone who takes offence to it. And there will always be people who enjoy the often witty and intelligent /All chat banter. By definition, you can&#039;t keep both parties happy. Either you sacrifice the security of the people who want to enjoy the game without critique, or you sacrifice the freedom of the players who want to engage in banter.\n\nIt is a contradiction.\nThe internet provides both freedom, and safety in its anonymity. \nBut the two are opposites and will always clash.\n___________\n\nThis all seems like straight-forward stuff you&#039;re probably thinking; why is Sessh spelling it out?\nBecause I want to make sure it is clear to _(to both sides)_ what we are actually asking for when we make our posts.\n\nWhen you make your post saying _&quot;You MUST report people for using gay as an insult!&quot;_ you are infact arguing to forfeit your own _(and everyone else&#039;s)_ freedom of speech! and that applies not just to whatever word or phrase you take offence to, but to every possible word that causes people to feel uncomfortable. You can&#039;t say _&quot;Don&#039;t call me gay, but it&#039;s okay for me to call you autistic.&quot;_ if you take offence to something and take a stand against people using that word, by your own logic you must abide by everyone else&#039;s insecurities as well, whatever they may be.\nSuddenly, not using _&quot;gay&quot;_ turns into not being able to use _&quot;fuck&quot;_, _&quot;shit&quot;_, _&quot;crap&quot;_, _&quot;egg&quot;_ or _&quot;Holy fish-sticks Batman&quot;_. \n\nAnd the opposite is true of course when you argue for lesser restrictions, your freedom of speech means that you forfeit your own right _(and everyone else&#039;s)_ to feel safe and secure in the online sphere. You have to endure whatever is thrown your way, that is the cost.\n\nNow we all have our own preferences, some don&#039;t mind having every insult in the book thrown at them, and will brush it away like water off a duck&#039;s back. Meanwhile others are quite happy for not a single word to ever be said in the whole game and for everyone to sit there and play in absolute silence. And Most of us find ourselves somewhere in the middle.\n\n____________\n\n#Our Choice\n\nUnfortunately, there is no perfect solution. People are different, they always have been, and unless Sci-fi horrors become reality, they always will be.\nThe tough truth is that some people will go unhappy. The only thing we can do is reduce that number as much as possible.\nAt some point we have to draw a line, the line can be at either end of the spectrum, or somewhere in the middle, but a line has to be drawn. And in the end, we have to decide where we draw the line. Because it is us that draws it, not Riot.\n\nWe have to look at what really matters to us. Is it really worth sacrificing that top lane sass with Susan, just so someone can&#039;t use &#039;gay&#039; in slightly the wrong context? Will you really cry yourself to sleep if someone makes a black joke? If not, then perhaps you should re-cosider your stand on how badly you want to see those people banned. Likewise, do you really care if you cant say N%%% or KYS if it means you can still keep the sassy /All chat war with Yasuo going?\n\n________\n\nPersonally, I think that things have gone way too far when real world words, whose true meaning has nothing to do with insults have become taboo:\nhttps://vimeo.com/249999712\n\nDoes it really cause you so much pain to hear the word cancer? if not, then perhaps you shouldn&#039;t have reported those guys for saying it, because now no one can say it, even you, in any context. Fight the big things, fight true homophobia and racism, don&#039;t waste time and effort getting the guy banned who said _&quot;Oh thats gay.&quot;_ when he died.\nThats my view on it anyway.\n\n______\n\n#Conclusion\n\nThe point of this post is to illustrate that the argument is deeper than: _&quot;That hurts my feelings, ban him.&quot;_. and _&quot;Why did I get banned for that?&quot;_ and that we have to think hard before we decide where we personally want to draw out lines before adding our voice into the mix.\nit is a human right to have freedom of speech, and it is a human right to feel safe. \nUnfortunately those two are contradictory, thats the way it is.\n_(the fact that human rights are just imposed social constructs and not actually a given &#039;entitlement&#039;, is a whole other discussion entirely, but that is irrelevant for this particular conversation.)_\n\nIm not telling anyone what their stand should or shouldn&#039;t be, I just want to create discussion and understanding about the underlying issues behind why this is the way it is, and where we can go from here. Im saying, you can&#039;t believe in freedom of speech and then demand someone gets banned for saying something that offended you. and that is something we all need to look at ourselves and think about, what are the values that we believe the internet is about?\n\nShould the internet be a sphere of freedom? Yes, No? \nPerhaps it shouldn&#039;t be? I dont know. I think we all need to ask ourselves these questions.\nDoes being gay, or black, or whatever, mean so much to you that you&#039;re willing to give up your own freedom within the internet just so someone can&#039;t use the word in the wrong context?\n\nWe draw the line, and now we have to look at ourselves and decide **where** and just as importantly, **why**.\n\n____________\n\nSorry for the super serious post guys, but with all thats happening behaviour wise, I thought might be the time to talk about this.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-07T19:36:57.805+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's where I stand on the issue personally:\n\n1) Harden the fuck up (it's the internet), but it's really **not** that hard to remain ban free.\n\n2) Offense is taken, not given.\n\n3) Automated chat bots giving bans is a terrible idea.

We don't get one or the other. It's really not that hard to be an asshole. Riot also has no obligation to protect our free speech in the same way that twitter doesn't, that's a choice they make but I would like to point something out and that is that **freedom of speech does not protect hate speech and hasn't for a very long time**.\n\nI get the argument of \"what if it's just a joke\". But even in the frankly quite rare scenarios where it is completely 100% a joke, it perpetuates that attitude. It says to other people that hating on people because of x thing that's different is perfectly ok.\n\nTaking a no tolerance policy involving even a sophisticated bot has it's problems, but I would much rather have an innocent person person have to appeal a ban every now and again (really how often do you accidentally type kys) than allow these people to continue to spew their garbage.\n\nI pretty much agree with QAPLA, except for number 3. If you don't agree that words like slurs or the like shouldn't be allowed that's fine, but this is the stance that Riot and the majority of the community has taken, knowing that it really shouldn't be that hard to just not say a handful of words when you're losing your shit at someone.\n\nAs for the automated part, I have yet to see *anyone* who got an escalated punishment post logs that weren't blatantly toxic, so clearly it's either not happening anywhere near as much as some people would like to claim, or they are all getting handled in a timely manner through support or otherwise to the point where there is no reason to come to a forum to complain.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-01-08T00:31:15.656+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not black or white, as Camille would say _\"But a delicious shade of grey.\"_\nbecause we can't have either black or white, we need a compromise between the two, one that suits the majority.\n\nAnd Riot only makes that choice because it is what they perceive as being beneficial to their interests _(in this case, keeping their money flow happy)_, the problem is, they only hear one side of the story, they only hear the big twitter Social Justice Warriors campaigning over the smallest infraction. Because the other side of the argument doesn't bother to make themselves heard.\n\nWe only hear the 1 in 20 _(made up statistic)_ people come out and say _\"So and so hurt my feelings.\"_, we dont hear the other 19 people come to the boards and be like _\"yea I had some great enjoyable banter today, and totally added the Thresh after the game.\"_. So naturally the community seems to Riot to be one sided, when in actual fact I doubt that is the full truth.\n\nI don't mean to say that freedom of speech does or should protect hate speech.\nBut I do think what a great number of us consider 'hate speech' is actually just our own intolerance towards critique.\n\nfor example _\"KYS You fucking N%%% c*nt\"_ is pretty clearly hate speech. It shows genuine aggression towards someone based on their racial profile. But using the word 'gay' in the wrong context is not hate speech. Yet some people campaign like it is the worst thing you can say.\n\nLike this for example:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYsUKPoW-Qo\n\nThats a serious NZ advert, telling people to stop saying gay cos its \"our word\" and \"you cant use it for anything other than what we want it to stand for\". When Gay is a word that has had several meanings in the course of its life, the most recent one being slang for something going not quite as we want, I think we need to think more carefully about where we draw the line of what we consider offence language.\n\nAgreed, in a perfect world no one should be mean to anyone, but it isn't a perfect world, if we enjoy our anonymous freedom on the internet, we have to accept that other people might use their freedom in a different and more antagonistic way. We have to find an acceptable compromise between the two, enough freedom to be worth being on the internet, but enough restrictions to keep people from too much harm.\n\nI can't comment on the automated system, I know little about it, but regardless there has been an escalation on the boards, and what in the system that is attributed to I cant be sure, but I doubt it comes completely out of the blue. It probably isn't as bad as people are making it out to be, but it is making a great deal _(of even completely non toxic people)_ avoid using the chat entirely which does affect communication and gameplay.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-08T00:42:24.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">Agreed, in a perfect world no one should be mean to anyone, but it isn't a perfect world\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl3H4vMqYNo","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2018-01-08T01:11:22.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=j9carvN4,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-01-07T23:53:37.508+0000)\n>\n> **freedom of speech does not protect hate speech and hasn&#x27;t for a very long time**.\n> \n\nlol hate speech is free speech tho","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-07T14:24:42.708+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":">So Im probably not everyone's favourite volunteer :S\n\nIf this is what you strive for, you will never reach it.\n\nBut hey, your one of my favourites.\n\n>Quite simply, we can't have both.\n\nPersonally my argument is that the 14 day instant bans are shit, and that being banned off 1 word is shit, not that the bans themselves are justified, just that the system has begun to nazi up and do too much too quickly and punish everyone way too harshly.\n\n>Because it is us that draws it, not Riot.\n\nNo it's not \"us\"\n\nTribunal would make it us the collective deciding, Riot doing this nazi shit makes it Riot drawing a line, that a potential minority want's.","replies":[{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-01-07T14:58:35.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=j9carvN4,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-01-07T14:24:42.708+0000)\n\n> Tribunal would make it us the collective deciding, Riot doing this nazi shit makes it Riot drawing a line, that a potential minority want&#x27;s.\n\nYeah, and then the people who are siding with riot say \"the teammates in your game made the choice to report you, there's no point of a tribunal if the community is already making the judgement\". One person and a bot/IFS simply isn't enough. \n\nI've legit wanted tribunal since we've had to move from NA. \n\nThere are certain circumstances such being explicitly racist, not just saying the N-word. I could say it all the time and I might be black myself. It's similar to saying that's gay when I could also be gay myself. When it is truly meant in a negative way and I mean very racist not just, typing lyrics from a song that has the N-word in it. Or, \"_that's gay, dude._\" it shouldn't be a punishable offense, but that's not the state we're in atm. You did make a fair point of being a hypocrite saying one thing to offend someone else then reporting that person when you've said something equally offensive.\nThe report system never used to be like this, It would take a lot to flag it. While it has improved in the sense of some no tolerance words such as \"kys\". It's good they made a change but they've taken it too far.\n\nI'd rather get permanently chat banned/restricted than to be perm banned. lol Isn't this what runescape used to do? After all that's the problem right? Everything involving chat is the only punishments I see being dished out. Minor cases, Some cases don't even have problems but will get told to use the chat more constructively instead of defending yourself or even replying as it's considered arguing with team mates and creating a negative environment. You can pretty much communicate entirely with pings, Even being chat restricted you get a few messages which will force players to use their messages more conservatively.\n\nHonestly, being permed or even two week banned, doesn't help much and for some people this penalty is too harsh mainly because there's only 4 tiers of penalties you can get. If you skip the first two and receive the third, you're basically out of chances.  The people that int/grief, maybe not 2 week ban, but depending on the situation a fair time period of a ban could be a useful system to them as chatting shit isn't their problem, **It's their game play.**\n\nI believe there's a compromise but Riot isn't willing to play ball as it's less $ in their pocket. \n\nPeople spend Hundreds even thousands of dollars on their account and lose it because they lose their temper in game using chat. If it was a perm chat ban, both parties would be happy. They don't feel like they wasted their money, get to keep their progress on their account; Riot will have 1 less toxic player due to the perm chat ban. Which seems to be \"so important\".\n\nI think even a perm chat ban is a bit far lol. Can't agree that 4 warnings is enough, it depends on the issue. What riot have made it clear on is that there's no tolerance on hate speech (racism, homophobia, self harm encouragement). These types of reports could be instant medium-long length penalty worthy. If penalties started from 1 day chat ban to 2 days etc keeps building up for the more minor issues. This idea has been thrown around a few times in different ways. Anyway, there's my 2 cents thanks lel\n\nEdited the post twice: \nThe bots in this game are a whole other story. The bots in this game get no punishments. Third party programs should ZERO TOLERANCE but they aren't getting punished for it. I played with a bot and I'm quite certain that everyone reported it. I've checked its match history and it's still managing to queue for games and feed its ass off running up and down top lane. Third party programs + cheating vs chat abuse. These bot accounts will be sold for money from someone who is permed and then the cycle repeats. You can see why the system is futile. \n\nThere are much larger issues than just flaming and arguing with a team mate(s).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CritTheClit","date":"2018-01-09T20:25:29.464+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"WHY CAN'T WE HAVE A TRIBUNAL?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-10T03:05:31.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Insert BS riot reasons here that make no real sense*","replies":[]}]}]}
