Evidently that didn't pan out. _(clash too has a thin hold on life right now)_\r\n\r\nWhat I want to know, is what assurances we have that the same fate won't swallow TFT? Or more specifically what happens to the content we buy for it, should it go the way of the Titanic?  Especially seeming the 'Little Legends' look like a large money sink for those committed to the game mode.\r\n\r\nYes they appear in ARAM in a big way too, but clearly not to the same extent as TFT. A lot of the features you'd by them for, aren't so evident in other game modes.  Sinking a lot of money into them, only for the game mode to be pulled out from under us months down the track would be annoying to say the least.\r\n\r\n**So my question is:**\r\n\r\nWhat can you give us in the way of promises, that investing into Little Legends, _(and arena skins etc)_, wont just turn out to be a waste of time and more importantly money, **IF** the game mode does crash and burn the way so many before it have?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n___________________\r\n\r\nI will make it clear, that I do really really want this game mode to succeed.  I'm very excited for it. I love the concept of Little Legends, and I'm happy to support that with my RP.  But considering the track record of other game modes _(especially seeming we can't even sustain 3v3 on this server, even in a ranked capacity)_, I'm a little cautious of what that RP will achieve long-term.\r\n\r\nHow we can't support even 1 permanent queue for 3's, yet we expect to support both ranked and normals for TFT indefinitely, raises its own questions too.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2019-06-27T01:03:04.387+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for asking this - its a really valuable topic as we want you to feel like you can fully engage with new mode, and especially its content, without something in the back of your mind about _what if..._  We're pretty damn excited for it too!\n\nThe short answer to your question is - we have every intention that TFT will be around to stay.  If players don't like it and don't engage with TFT, and for whatever reason it doesn't work out, then our intention is to do right by players that have spent money on the mode.\n\nThe focus thus far has been very much on bringing this out though, and I really hope that if it's your kind of thing, that you'll have fun with it :)\n\nhttps://imgur.com/abbQCs4","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-06-27T10:49:59.448+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for answering this.\nAfter you posted this I went and bought some eggs worry free ^^\nThanks for that\n\nI am loving the mode!

That is the assurance.\n\nThe genre is *huge* right now, and doesn't look like it's going anywhere anytime soon, so TFT has a very good chance of success, both as a quasi-gamemode in the client and possibly in the future as it's own game.\n\nIf the gamemode were to fail, I would imagine they would do something to compensate players who dropped a lot of money on it, but there is no guarantee of that.\n\nSo **tl;dr** the ARAM content and the genre.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-06-26T09:18:17.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The genre is huge, but so was Battle Royale when nexus blitz came out. So nothing is quite assured.\n\nPersonally, I do believe this is a keeper of a game mode, I'm enjoying it a lot _(although id love to see some form of 'make a deck' feature, so theres a little bit of strategy we can do outside the game)_. But I'm a sucker for avatars so I know i'll be dropping a fair bit into those little legends. I guess I just have to take a risk.\n\nARAM content is all good, but they become pets instead of avatars, and I don't know if people would pay as much if they knew the avatars would just turn into nothing but mindless pets in the future. _(would you pay 750+ for one of the ARAM poro icons?)_\n\nBut I guess we just have to risk it and take a leap of faith.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-06-26T10:13:05.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, but calling Blitz a battle royale would be misleading. Battle Royal was just one of the mini modes.\n\nI think a deck builder type deal would be a good way to approach adding more champs, since you can't have too many individual units for a game like this.\n\nThe struggle is finding meaningful ways to add the content elsewhere without compromising visuals, clarity, etc. I think something like the clash flags (which need to appear as you get to lane or before not in the middle of farming thank you very much) would be a good opportunity to bring them at least to the rift. I can't see them adding them elsewhere so long as TFT succeeds though. Time will tell I suppose.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-06-26T10:34:59.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't remember where I saw it (maybe one of the older posts about TFT) but it was said that they'd sit on the sidelines of summoners rift and cheer you on.  But it's one of those things where Ill believe it when i see it.\n\nYeah, it'd be cool if there were some champs that could only be gotten through RNG, but others that you could work towards through many games and add to your deck.  I guess we will just see how TFT evolves.\n\nI think it will stay, and one of the main factors is because when you win you get a good feeling. But when you lose, you don't really feel down. _(who knew RNG could feel good?)_.  Unlike regular league when if you win well you wanna play again, and sometimes when you lose badly, you wanna find a hole and go cry in it.  TFT has more ups than downs, _(especially seeming if you get smashed, you can leave the game and don't spend the next half an hour trying not to be a burden to your team.)_\n\nSo for those reasons I think (and hope) it'll stay.\nLike you say though, time will tell.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
