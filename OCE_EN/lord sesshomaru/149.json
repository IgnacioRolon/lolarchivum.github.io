I'm passing this on to the team.  It's not that the wolf is marking monsters in the friendly jungle, but that the mark color corresponds to Kindred's team. Basically, red marker = red side Kindred, blue marker = blue side Kindred.  It will look the same for the Kindred on each team.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-10-14T00:22:18.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhh ok thanks  for that :)\nSo will it be changed to red = enemy and blue = ally?\n\nAlso thanks so much riot for creating these really interesting champs like Azir Tahm kindred etc ^^\nThey make the game feel so much more alive :)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Koalifier","date":"2015-10-14T00:51:57.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm so excited to play Kindred!
