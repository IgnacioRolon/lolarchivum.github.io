No one is invested.  Tons of people will miss out because of this, who later down the track realise they love this champ, but oops, you didn&#039;t know that on day 1 of release, so of course you didn&#039;t throw $40 at a champ that literally just came out.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s bad enough when a champ goes so long with only 1 skin, but now it&#039;ll go so long with a skin that isn&#039;t even complete _(because many future players will have missed out on the border)_.  Thats going to be so stink for so many people.  You&#039;re supposed to be looking after your player base, not making them feel bad.\r\n\r\nWinter Wonder Neeko was bad enough, but at least you didn&#039;t have to throw $40 at it for a champ that just came out. You could earn it, and without too much trouble. _(not that thats much better through, it still sucks for future players of course)_.\r\n\r\nCan we please not be doing this?","replies":[]}
