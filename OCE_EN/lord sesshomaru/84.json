Wind that unique essence into the soul of that champ, theres so much potential there, like there was with Rakan/Xayah. Don&#039;t just pick an existing champ at random that has literally nothing to do with it and beat them with the gay stick to appease the keyboard warriors...\n\nIt&#039;s the same as putting the &#039;token&#039; black man in a film so you cant be called racist. Theres no need, just make good characters and if being a minority enhances that champ, go for it! If not, don&#039;t force fit it.\n\nXayah/Rakan works so well because they were always going to be a couple. It worked amazingly because you made a new champ with that as their essence. The same concept would have failed miserably if you had just reworked TF and Eve to be the in-game couple.\n\nYou play Varus, he has been out for 5 years so we all know him and his cause pretty well, and has absolutely no quotes or any hints at all of ever being in any form of relationship _(heterosexual or otherwise)_, nor is there any mention of him having 3 personalities inside him _(which you&#039;d think would somehow appear in his in-game flare...)_. and yet those are the things that he is supposedly literally all about? Infact when you play him, he&#039;s all about vengeance and death, which is pretty much the opposite to how the comic ended.\n\nand now you cant rework him either to fit him to the story, because you&#039;ve just made a new video about him that cements his current look, so there is no VU for him for a while yet.\n\nWhat you&#039;ve done is make a **really really cool** creation story, and applied it to a champ that has no need of it, and doesn&#039;t really suit it.\nThe _&#039;willingly giving into corruption sacrificing yourself and your morals for a good cause&#039;_ story was good, and it worked well for Varus.\nYou should have saved this love-loss story for a new Darkin or something else like that. It would have been so cool to see this story wound into the in-game essence of a champ, but now we don&#039;t get to see any of that because Varus&#039;s VO or character doesn&#039;t include any of it.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-12-01T07:50:02.194+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My initial reaction was 100%, wow, they are forcing Varus to be gay for no real reason. But then after a while to process it, and thinking \"does it fit?\", the answer is yes, because at no point is he considered any kind of sexuality, so giving him one is fine.\n\nThe only problem I have is that Varus is a 3 in 1 fusion... which was never hinted at.\n\nMy understanding of his old lore was, Varus defended the Darkin Bow from being stolen by Noxians (as shown in the new lore), then due to his village being destroyed and all his family killed, he releases the power in order to get vengeance on Noxus but is consumed by it.\n\nSimple. Clean. Varus, The Arrow of Retribution.\n\nWhat is he now? Varus, The Arrow of Multiple Personalities. I feel like if part 3 of the lore didn't exist and the video simply showed 3 becoming 1, that would have been fine. But showing him arguing inside himself, doesnt make much sense.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jason","date":"2017-12-01T06:00:05.668+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was done in a pretty beautiful, tasteful way. The film clip especially is great at highlighting the love these two had for each other.\n\nI don't think that means that varus is gay though, because varus is the darkin, with the two hunters fused into his body.\n\nSo he's 2/3rds gay?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-12-01T07:40:44.329+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh I agree it was a great story, and somehow it wouldn't have been as heartfelt if it was a girl and a guy (or even two girls for that matter).\nBut why Varus?

Also the way they handled it doesn't seem that new because its a bit similar to Kayn, but instead of two entities there is three.
