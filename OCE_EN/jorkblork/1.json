He's an assassin. By definition an assassin is someone who \"murders for political or religious beliefs\". My belief is the ADC should be dead and my religion is Rengar bitch. Assassin's in any game are designed to deal with 1 high priority backline target to allow leeway for your main force to advance. Rogues in WoW deal with spellcasters, hunters and healers so that the tanks can push up. The spy in TF2 is meant to sneak in, stab someone and sneak out. However, in League, basically anyone can oneshot you. Even tanks. Think about how many things can just kill the ADC with no counterplay. It's a lot, from full tank poppys all the way to other assassins like Zed/Kat. ADCs are meant to be killed by just about most characters. Why? Because if they get more than 2-3 seconds of damage in a teamfight they'll shred your entire team to pieces late game. For this reason we have assassins. Lategame teamfights are decided by which ADC does more damage and, in turn, which assassin can kill the ADC first. That's how this game fucking works, if you think assassins one-shotting an ADC is bad, go play minecraft where things don't oneshot you. If your're an ADC splitpushing alone and see that fucking exclamation mark appear above your head, you shouldn't be able to outplay that. That's not a fight, that's a scenario that just needs to be played out. This isn't street fighter that's fucking chess, you're in the wrong square - you die.","replies":[{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-05-11T06:20:18.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kadius,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=wBKEuaJT,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2017-05-10T11:22:02.734+0000)\n>\n> Okay I don&#x27;t normally get annoyed at comments but OH BOY did this one bug me.

I get the idea Rengar is an assassin and should be able to kill a high priority threat, but I don't think he should be getting some buffs like the post says.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-05-10T07:51:24.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And?\nThat's what's supposed to happen when an ADC fights an assassin.","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2017-05-10T14:44:33.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly, at least Assassins are generally squishy enough to outplay.
