I know there isn't a perfect measure of this, but by making LP dependent on more things, it adds stress (e.g. if a win is imminent, people still have to worry about keeping their scores as high as possible and getting good grades rather than just closing out the game).\n\nIf a new system were to be implemented, it would be trading the ability to relax in-game for more control over player's rankings.

Unless your death will result in a net win for the team (e.g. you pooped on the carry, died, and won the teamfight).\n\nAnyway, I don't think this will change how people naturally play a great deal. I think it will help stop people trolling (feeding, etc).

People can take objectives, protect their team members, push out lanes, provide vision... so many selfless plays that wouldn't show up in the rating. If rating is included in LP calculations, people are discouraged from putting the welfare of the team before themselves. \n\nImplementing a gradings-based system also adds unnecessary stress to games - even if a win is very likely, players would focus on keeping their kda's as high as possible, not taking the risks that are necessary to close out the game. If a loss is likely, a person might completely avoid enemies so that they don't risk dying and making their score worse whilst their teammates are left to defend (and are thus unlikely to succeed).\n\nOverall, the current system works in it's own way - a better player would win more on average than a worse one, so they should be ranked higher.
