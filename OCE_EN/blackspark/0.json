It doesn't make sense that even if I played a really good game and someone else in my team has a bad game we both lose the same amount of LP. Alternatively if someone else on my team plays really well and wins the game for our team I don't feel like I deserve the same LP as him/her. \r\n\r\nI've heard people compare the LP system to the ELO system but that confuses me even more as ELO has been used for individual sport in the past (chess) rather than team sports. As far as I'm aware LP is not dependent on individual performance and entirely dependent on team performance. Is this true? And if it is, surely this is a poor design?\r\n\r\nI can understand the LP system for ranked 5s as it is the team which loses/gains LP but it does not make sense in solo queue. Am I expected to try and single handedly win every game? I can see that a good player might win many more games and still climb the ladder in this system. It just seems like a system which accounted for individual rather than team performance would be a more accurate indication of a player's ability and players would ascend/descend the ladder quicker with it.\r\n\r\nSorry if this seems like a silly discussion, I'm just trying to make sense of the whole thing and if I'm missing something obvious please point it out.","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-08-03T06:51:32.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is the easiest thing to remember:\n\nHigh mmr = More lp\nLower mmr (than your whole ranks mmr average) = Less lp\n\nEz, don't need to remember a whole lot :P\nI know this too well because I'm in Bronze.","replies":[]},{"poster":"demonicslothman","date":"2015-08-02T07:32:20.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just a thought.

Hopefully I can provide some insight on our ranked system for you.\n\nLP is definitely only based on the result of your game. Win and you go up, Lose and you go down. There is MMR like mentioned in other comments which runs parallel to your division/LP. It can help determine whether you skip divisions on the climb or lose. Red Arrow explains that segment pretty well.\n\nYou mentioned that the LP system is like the Elo system and this confuses you because originially Elo has been used 1 on 1 games such as chess.\n\"The Elo system was invented as an improved chess rating system and is also used in many other games. It is also used as a rating system for multiplayer competition in a number of video games,[1] and has been adapted to team sports including soccer (association football), American college football, basketball, Major League Baseball, competitive programming, and esports.\"\n[Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system)\n\n**TL;DR** Teamwork makes the dream work\n\nLeague of Legends is a team game and a big part of performance is based on **teamwork**. Now of course you say solo queue should have solo performance in mind, I argue it does indirectly. If you have more games where your own performance is good (say KDA of 4+) then you will win more games. Your own performance affects wins and losses. But of course KDA isn't the only thing you can do right? Every player in our game can not only affect the game through kills/deaths/assists but there are a variety of \"intangibles\" that each individual player can provide; (including but not limited to)\n\n1. **Lane pressure** - Even if the opposing lane doesn't die lane pressure can keep them from going to other lanes or getting exp/cs\n2. **Map pressure** - Even if you aren't getting KDA you can pressure the map by roaming to other lanes or pressuring their team to come deal with you\n3. **Vision control** - Even if you aren't getting KDA you can provide valuable information across the map to see where the enemy team is, secure towers, secure dragon, secure baron AND set up game winning traps\n4. **Communication** - Even if you aren't getting KDA you can win future fights by communicating where the enemies are, where wards are, when objectives are up, when your ultimate and summoners are up, where your team should be and keeping morale up.\n5. **Tanking/blocking skill shots/peeling** - Even if you aren't getting KDA you could be a big tank soaking all the skill shots and damage for your damage dealers\n\nThe above is only a few I could think of off the top of my head, there are probably more that will come to mind AND more I don't even know about.\n\nSo what is the best way to measure your individual performances like kills, deaths, assists, cs, crowd control used, damage taken, damage dealt **AND** Lane pressure, map pressure, vision control and communication?\n\nIn my opinion the best way to measure all of the above is through wins and losses. Not one player can contribute to all of the above, but every player will contribute something different to each category. In every win or loss, different roles provide different combinations of each category.\n\nI.E in every game win or lose\n\n* Marksman will probably do High Damage, have High gold, have Good KDA, provide communication, lane pressure, map pressure\n* Support will probably do low damage, low gold, maybe bad KDA (dying so Marksman can live or get kills), provide communication, lane pressure, map pressure, vision control, peeling\n\nIts easier to feel like a Marksman does more every game but that doesn't mean the Marksman deserves more LP than a support. Even if you're carrying a game with 14 kills and tonnes of gold, you still need your team there to provide all the intangibles, throw stuns our for you, disrupt the other team, soak damage, take enemy crowd control so that you can deal as much damage as you can. Even if you're 14 - 0 you can't run head first into another team of 5.\n\nObviously there are extreme edge cases where you could literally be 40-0-40 and still lose cause like 3 people on your team dced or are having a really bad day, but those edge cases balance out over the long run, you just gotta make sure it doesn't put you on tilt.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2015-07-30T08:44:50.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League of Legends is a team game and a big part of performance is based on teamwork.\n\nThis works both ways, just as you are required to work with your team, your team must work with you in order to get the most out of each player. The problem with that is if your team does not use teamwork and the enemy does, then the enemy has a clear advantage which will quite often lead to their victory. This working both ways is the problem. It is luck on who you get paired with that will determine how effective the team can be.\n\nPlayers can have vastly different experience and skill levels but still be stuck in the same elo group as players who have only just started and they get paired with them. This means in each lane they might have very different levels of skill and one will quickly snowball over the other. Then all of a sudden they have a big gold and xp lead and use that to take out the rest of the team. If you are vs someone who will not let you kill them and is willing to give up farm and even xp to make sure they don't die, then their teammate who is getting fed off your teammate will be easily stronger and quickly wipe you out. Then your lane opponent can get free farm during death timers and you all of a sudden become far behind.\n\nThis can be all based off luck on who you get paired with and who is on the enemy team, that is why I think the system needs to be reformed in one way or another. Your team does not have the same ability as the enemy team, it could be better or worse, there is rarely a game I see that is close and those ones i can usually be the main part of securing a victory for my team.\n\n\nI personally feel like kda is almost irrelevant in terms of end result, the reason why you see kda as being more positive on a win and negative on a loss, is because if the enemy is stronger you will more consistently be getting killed, if you are further ahead you will be getting more kills/assists and less deaths, this can be from 5 mins and onwards that other lanes (even mid) can come into the lane to gank. Every kill is the result of the enemy being in a position for you to be able to kill them, every death is you putting yourself in a position to be killed regardless of the skill level of an enemy, whether it is faker or someone first time playing ranked, they will not be able to kill you if you do not put yourself in a position for them to kill you.\n\nThis very reason also forces players who know they have to carry to win the game to play risky and put themself in dangerous situations to try out play the enemy, which often leads to deaths which in turn can be the final decider as to the enemy being able to win or not. The more fed an enemy is, the less they have to do to be able to kill someone.\n\nIn regards to the 5 types of intangibles I find myself frequently providing 4-5 in most roles while my team rarely provides anything except communication and some vision now and then. Once again it is based around luck whether or not I get teammates who do this and their contribution to the team is what can win or lose a game. Having no control over this i believe I should not be getting ranked according to something I can not directly change or have control over that changes frequently every game. It is not my fault if they are unable to perform as well as the enemy team, nor is it my fault if they do perform better. If I play badly and still climb, then play really well and drop in mmr this will end up leading to some really imbalanced games in low elo and even higher up as bad players can still be carried and climb.\n\nIf solo performance rating was a thing, just like the current system of your own ranking at the end of the game (s+ to D-) with a bit of tweaking, could negate trolls being carried up and bringing other players down. Smurfs could easily rise in ranks to their legitimate ranking, elo boosters can do their job better but also get caught easier (big raise in performances over short durations). Players who perform well can go up, players who perform badly go down with only a minor difference per match on win/loss. There should still be an incentive to win but you should not be limited by the outcome of the game where 10 players have input in the outcome.\n\ntl;dr\n\nNo one should ever be ranked according to the performance of others when that rank is considered their own personal level of ability.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-07-31T01:35:09.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey WhitePumah,\n\nThanks for the long post on your thoughts. I believe you bring up a couple of points I would like to touch on.\n\n1) \n> Your team does not have the same ability as the enemy team, it could be better or worse, \n\nSo this is an interesting point, that I do tend to agree with with one exception. I believe you are missing a few key parts to this. Remember players on your team and your opponents team are pulled from the same pool of players\n\nA) Teams can be better, worse or **even** with a higher tendency towards even games due to the MMR match making system\n\n> there is rarely a game I see that is close\n\nNow I know you said this in your statement but its just not true. If all of your games are one sided then your average game time would be under 25 minutes (stomps either way) however if we have a quick look over Ranked match history we can see that in your last 60 games you have the following stats around game time.\n\nIn **60 games**\nAverage game time **35.8** minutes\nGames that lasted 25 minutes or less = 5\nGames that lasted 30 minutes or less = 20\nThis means that **40** our of your last 60 games went longer than 30 minutes\n\nSo I would actually argue that a majority of your games are close/even in terms of team skill. Now let just **pretend** its completely random, you could get better/worse/even teams AND its a **33% chance** to get those 3 options in your games. (remember we have already proved its more likely to get close games)\n\nBecause the teammates and enemies you get each game is **random** over a larger number of games (60+) you should have about the same number of games where your team is better, worse, and even. For example over 60 games you should have 20 games where your team is better, 20 games where your team is worse, 20 games where your team is even.\n\nThis means you are pretty much guaranteed 20 wins (better team whoo), 20 losses (worse team boo). The remaining 20 games are even and as you said yourself \"those ones i can usually be the main part of securing a victory for my team.\" So even if it was completely random the wins and losses cancel each other out and the ones that matter are the ones where you are in control (the even games).\n\nBut as I showed earlier through your game times players have **MORE** even games than the other 2 choices. So it probably looks more like this;\n\n20% better team\n40% even team\n20% worse team\n\nLets use 100 games as an example, this means you get 20 free wins (better team whooo), 20 losses (worse team boooo) but 40 games are close and you are the one that makes the difference.\n\n> In regards to the 5 types of intangibles I find myself frequently providing 4-5 in most roles while my team rarely provides anything except communication and some vision now and then.\n\nThis literally just sounds like you saying I'm so much better than everyone I play with and my team is always letting me down. This is the generic ELO Hell complaint and you should watch this to get that mind set changed.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MTO2a7ZFcc\n\n2)\n> If solo performance rating was a thing, just like the current system of your own ranking at the end of the game (s+ to D-) with a bit of tweaking\n\nWhile I do think there is some merit in this approach it is something that has been considered historically and we have had many discussions around it.\n\nLosing because of your team is frustrating. But the issue with using any metric other than win loss is that whatever those metrics are become the win condition and change behavior. That said, the matchmaker does give accurate MMRs for players based on game results, it just takes a bit longer to get players to their expected MMR than in a single player games. It takes about 50 games for you to land at your expected position. Given the negative implications of using any other metric we feel this is the best way to handle matchmaking currently.\n\n~~~~~\n\nA lot of your comment really seems to be you complaining about your team which I think is not a good discussion, pros have shown countless times that if you're a better player you climb rank.\n\nI have now given you analysis on your previous games by KDA at the 13 minute mark AND game time.\n\nHowever I do much prefer discussion topic 2, I would love to hear how you think it would be possible to implement a system where personal stats impact your MMR. How would you balance this with wins? which means more? You said KDA is not a good measure what should we use to measure by then?\n\nThe biggest concern historically is if we use personal stats it really alters gameplay e.g. instead of going for wins people just go for kills","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2015-07-31T06:04:19.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Remember players on your team and your opponents team are pulled from the same pool of players\n\nThe problem is that the pool of players that players are grouped in can be vastly different both in experience and skill, throwing 5 to each side to balance out the teams mmr to be close to the other teams mmr simply means nothing to me because I know how vastly different players levels can be and this also includes smurfs, trolls, intentional feeders, afk's and dc's.\n\nThe ratio I am finding is more like 60% worse teams, 10% even teams and 30% better teams.\n\nOne player can not affect this game in enough of a way to make a big enough difference, I literally tried to intentionally feed one game as singed support to drop my mmr for a test. My mid laner ryze went 20 kills at 16 minutes, and by 25-30 mins they were inside the enemies base and my top laner, riven got a pentakill and they ended the game. I then realised that no game is ever completely in my own hands. Whether I am trying to win or lose one single player can not make enough of a difference to make sure that a win/loss is 100% no matter how well they do it.\n\n> Now I know you said this in your statement but its just not true. If all of your games are one sided then your average game time would be under 25 minutes (stomps either way) \n\nThe reason the enemy team can't end the game pre 25 mins is 90% because of me, every game the enemy is stomping us in I will never surrender, I will never stop trying. Due to this I can wave clear and continue using my abilities effectively usually to get a kill here and there and delay their pushes. I quite consistently do well in lane so I am able to do this, you will notice this with most of my zilean games because I have decent wave clear and the ability to revive teammates which can delay the enemy for quite some time. If I am losing in lane is usually a guaranteed loss.\n\nI am forced to duo just so I do not get outvoted in a surrender vote 4-1.\n\nYou are continually speaking of how games can go random but there is a % chance for things to happen like better worse or even. The very reason there is a chance makes it potentially imbalanced for each individual. If you have worse teammates one game, you may or may not get a worse team again. The very problem with this is that they **might** not even balance out, once you have your first game with better or worse teammates, that then becomes your base level of equality and it in itself is an irrelevant factor to the next games. Think of it like on a line scale, you have your first game and you get a bad team so you sit at -1 on the scale. If you have another game with bad teammates because it is chance based and not balanced, that becomes -2. If you just so happen to have another 8 bad teams in a row purely by chance because that is the only factor it can be based on. You end up with -10 and this will not give any effect towards getting a team of players who are better. Effectively due to chance you could have 100 bad teams in a row. The chance of getting a worse team or better team will not change during the entire process.\n\nOverall balance is not a intentional factor, it is another possibility which dictates the rank of a player.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-07-31T06:10:29.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As I said before I am happy to discuss what you think a better system is but talking more about how teams are always imbalanced in your favor is just not productive.

If your LP gains are High (20-30/game), your actual MMR will be a bit higher than your LoLKing score, and if your LP gains are Low (0-10/game), your actual MMR will be a bit lower than your LoLKing Score.\n\nIt's the closest measurement you can get to the old Elo system.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-01-15T07:08:04.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nope.

Win games, get mmr and vice versa. From what I have read, it seems that the hidden mmr is what is influenced ( a little) by kda. \n\nFor example; my friend is in silver 5 and has won 7/12 ranked games that she has ever played. Her KDA in her games is absolutely appalling and she usually goes 2/16/3 and a top laner or a jungler. Despite her winning, she gains minimal LP (and loses heaps when she does lose) and her mmr is low enough for her to be matched with bronze 4 in ranked games. \nMe on the other hard, has a 45% ranked win rate but usually has a good kda (at least when I play support). I play against mid-high silvers and gain 30+ LP per win and lose about 12 LP.\n\nLP gain is an incentive for the teams to work together (league is a team game, read the summoners code) so each individual player can advance themselves in rank. People play ranked to carry themselves into LP heaven (which is why there are usually fights over carry roles). You aren't meant to try and singlehandedly win all your games, you are meant to work as a team so you can all enjoy more LP. However, at the moment it does appear that the game can be won singlehandedly by some players getting really fed and one shotting everybody or be lost be someone rage quitting or intentionally feeding. To truly advance to higher divisions, thats when you will realise that you actually have to get good and rely on team mechanics. \n \nAs justify pointed out, if you were given LP solely based on KDA the game would fall apart because every single team would fight amongst themselves over kills. It would make the current toxicity seem like nothing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-01-14T04:59:37.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is a team game, your LP IS dependant on your team winning, it's just how league goes.","replies":[]}]}
