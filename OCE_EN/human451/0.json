After lvl 30, people do not  play as seriously anymore, and when they do it is just an avalanche of toxic salt. \r\n\r\nMy biggest issue is that nobody calls roles. \r\n\r\nMy suggestion is that riot introduce compulsory role calling, in the form that people HAVE TO type in chat during champ select. Failure to do so would result in &quot;dodging&quot;. To make this work, a player should be unable to lock-in a champion until they have sent something to the team chat. This would not only encourage decent roles, but deal with botting too (this is another huge problem in COOP vs AI specifically). People who don&#039;t care what role they get can call &quot;fill&quot;.\r\n\r\nThis is partly my own fault for not being able to play all roles, but when someone &#039;insta-locks&#039; a champ that takes my role it can ruin the game. If i choose to then dodge, I risk a queue time penalty. In my opinion, this behaviour should not be accepted as normal in League of Legends, but rather should have systems in place to deter/prevent it.","replies":[]}
