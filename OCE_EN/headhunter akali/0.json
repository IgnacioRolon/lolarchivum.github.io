This change is really, really, really, really bad.. Like whoever came up with this change needs to be fired..\n\nAkali's AA range is 125 units.. Her ult now places her 150 - 250 units behind the target.. Am i missing something crucial about this math here?\n\nLike... This change might have worked well for her kit, if you could still proc Q with E. But, seeing as how Akali is absolutely dependent on getting that AA off as soon as possible once she ults into the crowd, this change was actually thee absolute biggest nerf they ever did to Akali.\n\nIt is reallllllly.......... reallllllllly............... bad though.. I just ulted to someone 3 times and got one mark off... You know why? Cuz all you have to do now is walk toward Akali as she ults. Her ult then spits her out so far behind you that she is forced to either walk back to you after ulting or simply ult again.. Could you imagine how incredibly bad this would get against a champion with any sort of movement speed enhance / dash to their kit (which nearly every champion has)?\n\nSo many champions in this game are still, to this day, **WAY **more overpowered then Akali. Why are we still picking on her? It was already hard enough getting that clunky ass auto attack off.. Now she is completely killed. Any competent player can literally perma dodge her mark.. GG Akali\n\nWell done Riot. Another solid piece of shit update to Akali. As if the E not procing Q didn't make her clunky enough.","replies":[{"poster":"Headhunter Akali","date":"2015-05-15T04:59:09.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well said my friend","replies":[{"poster":"dropadook","date":"2015-05-15T05:24:51.716+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like... this might just be one of the most incompetent changes they ever made to this game. The mechanics of her ult were as on-point as they possibly could be before this change.. The way her ult use to bring you to the target was literally 100% perfect.. Absolutely nothing wrong with it.\n\nI use to be able to ult to someone who was standing directly on their turret agro line, and not take turret agro (in fact this was one of my main ways of solo killing people who thought they were safe under their turret). Now, I literally cant even ult to someone who is standing 250 units away from their turret agro line..?? WTF?? Are you even fcking kidding me?\n\nI'm just curious to see how Riot is going to clean up this mess. They know E not procing Q was a shit tier change that completely destroyed the synergy of her abilities. Now they go and do this to try and redeem her, but end up making her 100x worse. Akali's gameplay is so sloppy now, she is almost unplayable and virtually incapable of executing the kind of plays that she needs to execute in order to win games.\n\nThese new ult mechanics are bugged to all hell as well. It rarely spits you out at a consistent distance away from your opponent. It is far too unpredictable to be healthy for her kit. This change clearly had no extensive testing prior to release.. How did this make it past PBE? No Akali mains on the PBE?","replies":[{"poster":"Headhunter Akali","date":"2015-05-15T06:18:41.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well hopefully riot will see this post and with enough concerned league players get the changes reverted because now she is truly broken..... totally unplayable as an assassin in the state shes in.","replies":[{"poster":"AlphaDavePeng","date":"2015-05-20T14:47:09.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont see these changes as a nerf or a buff, the ult going behind allows you to dodge a lot of skillshots and i see it as a change in playstyle.\n\nI was playing akali ever since i started playing league and i loved her as an asassin but i love her as the tanky bruiser you can play her as at the moment\n\nThe build i use is a little unusual and on paper may seem bad but in practice it is very good\n\nSummoner Spells \nSmite\nFlash\n\nItems\nChilling smite -Cinderhulk\nRabduins\nRylais\nGunblade\nAbyssal\nLucidity boots\n\nTanky runes and masteries \nWith this new build your mid game damage is huge and you are still stron late game.

Catch up with the new meta people. She works a bruiser now.

When someone is walking toward someone it literally takes akali **longer** to get her mark off by ulting to them rather then just by simply continuing to walk straight towards them....\n\nThat alone is a **clear** and **obvious** fail. There's no other explanation for that other then it being 100% wrong. You cant be marking mofos faster by walking to them, then by ulting.. Akali's ult IS Akali. Without that, Akali is literally nothing.\n\nP.S. Akali will always be a BURST DAMAGE ASSASSIN, not a f*cking bruiser.. Her kit scales way too effectively with AP to make any thing else on her viable.
