In both games I had 2 team mates in a row feeding constantly and calling me the N word and flaming more than me, I never swore once or threatened anybody with anything. I had a mundo constantly running it down and threatening to \"ruin my whole day\" after that insulting me and literally calling me a \"nigg*r\".\r\n\r\nI understand that many people in LOL can be very toxic, I try contain myself but literally getting banned for calling someone an idiot or referring to him as an ass is the most stupidest thing I've ever seen / heard. \r\nHere are the chat logs.\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nkrisarkk: Dont bother xD\r\nkrisarkk: They dont have jungle either\r\nkrisarkk: Zyra\r\nkrisarkk: you're not\r\nkrisarkk: legit\r\nkrisarkk: you insta locked\r\nkrisarkk: when someone already called\r\nkrisarkk: *sigh*\r\nkrisarkk: 2 supports\r\nkrisarkk: Isn't good\r\nkrisarkk: Come support then....\r\nkrisarkk: Legi t\r\nkrisarkk: This is a nightmare\r\nkrisarkk: Stay away\r\nkrisarkk: No\r\nkrisarkk: Just stop running after her\r\nkrisarkk: Keep distance\r\nkrisarkk: ^^^\r\nkrisarkk: Well you smurfing against kat?\r\nkrisarkk: Lux\r\nkrisarkk: What are you doing xD\r\nkrisarkk: hows smurfing going mundo?\r\nkrisarkk: THEN WHY PICK HIM?\r\nkrisarkk: LOL\r\nkrisarkk: AHAHAH CALLING ME 1 TRICK\r\nkrisarkk: BRO I HAVE M7 CAIT AND LUCIAN\r\nkrisarkk: ITS 3RD TIME PLAYING JHIN\r\nkrisarkk: Because I wanna play jhin??????????????\r\nkrisarkk: STOP FEEDING\r\nkrisarkk: OMGGGGG\r\nkrisarkk: have fun with the 14 day then\r\nkrisarkk: Report mundo, inting and being an ass\r\nkrisarkk: ^*\r\nkrisarkk: 6*\r\nkrisarkk: ahahaha\r\nkrisarkk: ^^^^\r\nkrisarkk: She meant he's doing well in feeding her ROFL\r\nkrisarkk: Mundo why didn't you play aphel then?\r\nkrisarkk: WHAT\r\nkrisarkk: Bruh that was the luckiest dodge\r\nkrisarkk: ROFL\r\nkrisarkk: It's good that she has the kills\r\nkrisarkk: not the var ROFL\r\nkrisarkk: I need more stacks\r\nkrisarkk: rofl\r\nkrisarkk: Lovely\r\nkrisarkk: Report mundo\r\nkrisarkk: Good meme\r\nkrisarkk: AHHAAH\r\nkrisarkk: Bye mundo\r\nkrisarkk: Leave now\r\nkrisarkk: might save you\r\nkrisarkk: You never know\r\nkrisarkk: so closeee\r\nkrisarkk: Great\r\nkrisarkk: Mundo\r\nkrisarkk: uninstall league\r\nkrisarkk: pleaser\r\nkrisarkk: Just a little hint\r\nkrisarkk: If your client is lagging\r\nkrisarkk: Run it in prio mode\r\nkrisarkk: AHAHA\r\nkrisarkk: mute me if you want but have fun with the ban\r\nkrisarkk: Yeah nah\r\nkrisarkk: we ffing '\r\nkrisarkk: lol\r\nkrisarkk: I mean I thought you were gonna have a comback\r\nkrisarkk: but you int more\r\nkrisarkk: I mean you're smurfing\r\nkrisarkk: Right?\r\nkrisarkk: Sure you are\r\nkrisarkk: you're mainly garbage tho\r\nkrisarkk: 18 :DD\r\nkrisarkk: ROFL\r\nkrisarkk: 93.6\r\nkrisarkk: Better t you &lt;3\r\nkrisarkk: 40 atare\r\nkrisarkk: but you cant brain this game\r\nkrisarkk: shame\r\nkrisarkk: AHAHA same here\r\nkrisarkk: I only play for 2 hours a day\r\nkrisarkk: I mean i'm a BD at apple\r\nkrisarkk: shame\r\nkrisarkk: big brain\r\nkrisarkk: gamer\r\nkrisarkk: You dont cut for anything @ all\r\nkrisarkk: you inted\r\nkrisarkk: sooooo\r\nkrisarkk: 0/8\r\nkrisarkk: And you were mouthing the urgot\r\nkrisarkk: She has less deaths tho\r\nkrisarkk: soooo\r\nkrisarkk: Cool\r\nkrisarkk: See the thing you dont understand is\r\nkrisarkk: that youre getting a 14 day\r\nkrisarkk: Cool\r\nkrisarkk: Well uninstall\r\nkrisarkk: Makes players gameplay better\r\nkrisarkk: Nahhh\r\nkrisarkk: Just dont like lying 15 year olds thinking their top stuff\r\nkrisarkk: When their garbage mundo players who blame ui lock and lag\r\nkrisarkk: I check op.gg\r\nkrisarkk: You're garbage\r\nkrisarkk: i mean you know im right\r\nkrisarkk: rofl\r\nkrisarkk: Cool\r\nkrisarkk: uninstall\r\nkrisarkk: thanks\r\nkrisarkk: Report mundo\r\nkrisarkk: G\r\nGame 2\r\nIn-Game\r\nkrisarkk: Rumble\r\nkrisarkk: I swear\r\nkrisarkk: Go play bots\r\nkrisarkk: That range\r\nkrisarkk: Stop feeding\r\nkrisarkk: Good one idiot\r\nkrisarkk: run into me\r\nkrisarkk: Nice call idiot\r\nkrisarkk: FF it\r\nkrisarkk: legit\r\nkrisarkk: Get reported\r\nkrisarkk: Legit\r\nkrisarkk: you're getting a 14\r\nkrisarkk: Trash\r\nkrisarkk: Rumble wont\r\nkrisarkk: Love how fed you are\r\nkrisarkk: Report ruble please\r\nkrisarkk: Report rumble please\r\nkrisarkk: Who feeds a kled\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan I please have a conversation or get a reply from an actual riot employee instead of a blitzcrank bot.\r\nLiterally spent so much money on LOL it's not even funny. \r\n\r\nThanks \r\n- Krisark.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2020-01-11T07:57:54.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you believe you've been wrongly banned, you can feel free to appeal by submitting a ticket to [Support](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Discuss a personal suspension or restriction\" option). Based on context, it sounds like you might have already done so, but it's the standard appeal process (which we always recommend) and posting on the boards almost never changes the outcome of an appeal. You *should* be able to get a response from an actual support agent (rather than Blitz Bot) by requesting one in the relevant ticket, and you should be able to get a more in-depth response by asking for one as well.\n\nSo far as the logs are concerned, behaviours like insulting/berating teammates, consistent negative attitudes, repeatedly calling for surrender, (arguably) passive-aggressive chat use, are all things that can contribute to a punishment. Based on how much is there, I'm inclined to say having several games like what's shown in the provided logs in a relatively short time frame is more than likely going to trigger a punishment. What that punishment is will depend on your accounts standing, primarily what your last punishment (if any) was (standard progression is chat restriction [10-game then 25-game] followed by suspension [14-day then permanent]). If you haven't followed the standard progression, you will probably have a case for reduction.","replies":[]}]}
