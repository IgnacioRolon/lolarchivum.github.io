The two tournaments we're looking at right now are the ones hosted by ACL. We would like to compete in the many other tournaments though we can't without a team and this is what this post is for.\r\n\r\nThe rewards for these tournaments are where valuable points/rp and also **“At the end of the split the teams at the top of the ladder will progress into the Challenger Series where they can fight for a spot in the relegation tournament and try and punch their ticket into the Pro League.”** My mate and I have always wanted to get an opportunity to prove ourselves and to compete against the best and we wouldn’t want to waste this opportunity.\r\nThis is what my friend and I are looking for, we’re looking for three competitive and very serious players who are DIAMOND+ to take on this challenge with us. The roles we are looking for are…\r\n\r\nTop Lane – **Looking for players** {{item:2044}} \r\nMid Lane – Occupied (ZxRiddikxZ – Diamond 4)\r\nJungle – **Looking for players** {{item:2044}} \r\nADC – Occupied (im fkn bad – Gold 3)\r\nSupport – **Looking for players** {{item:2044}} \r\n\r\nI understand that I’m looking for diamond+ players and I have a gold 3 ADC but I will explain that in full detail later on to the players who do decide to join.\r\nThe team name has not yet been decided on, my mate and I were willing to hold that off until we have our full team which we will then all decide on a new team name.\r\n\r\nThe tournament that we’re willing to join is on the 9th of December though there is another tournament on the 16th of December that we’ll be also joining of the team that we find is up for it. The link to the websites that I found the information is.\r\nhttp://aclpro.com.au/events/2014/online/lol/oceanicopenladder.html \r\nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/oceanic-open-ladder\r\n\r\n**Note: Please make sure that if you are interested you can attend practice sessions and can be online at least 5 hours+ a day. I've had history where players would sign up for the team and would never show up to practice sessions or even log in. Please don't be one of these people. You're just wasting your time and my time.**\r\n\r\nAnyways, thanks a lot of reading all of this and we hope to find a team that we can work with shortly. If you are interested in joining please post a reply here and add \"Im fkn bad\" on the league client and I'll give you the information that you need to know.\r\n\r\nGood luck on the fields of justice~","replies":[{"poster":"TheLostBB","date":"2014-12-07T04:29:15.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support main.
