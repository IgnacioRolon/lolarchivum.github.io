Mpen is essentially high impact but low use so far as my experience goes, so it makes sense to have it more expensive, it just won't be used as often. Instead of buying Morello because it's always good and has everything, you buy it when you want Mpen or Grievous wounds specifically for a better result.\n\nMeanwhile the CDR and Mana stats have been shifted to Luden's to push it more as \"I want burst damage and I want it more often\", and the Movespeed on Luden's has been moved to Spellbinder {{item:3907}} which has a better active to synergise with it.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-25T09:15:42.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While i get what your saying, it's not as high an impact as you think, because your giving up AP to get the Mpen, and getting very little for it.\n\nAt least old Liandry's (which is where the mpen is moved from) had a decent amount of AP, plus a decent passive (grievous wounds is again, basically only good vs vlad) while still being a surviablity item as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-25T11:29:40.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only 20 AP, so against an MR heavy team I'd say it's definitely worth it, but I also haven't had the opportunity to actually play it yet and I'm a fan of mpen in general so I'm probably a little biased.\n\nUltimately the idea was to solidify the place of items that were a little all over the place. Whether they're going to hold their own in those places, I think it's probably a little to early to say, at least from an individuals perspective. I'm liking Spellbinder so far though the active feels a little short.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-25T12:53:51.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing is Mpen is meh at best in a lot of games, and you have to end up getting a void staff because items like {{item:3102}} {{item:3139}}  exist, and these are MR and just generally a good defensive item to have for squishies, which means your Mpen goes down in value.\n\nThere's a reason good players would tend to sit on {{item:3136}}  until they had their Rylai's, because the stats you got going up wasn't worth the upgrade, and the 15 Mpen isn't worth having for an item that basically ONLY gives that Mpen and nothing else good (again unless your against vlad)\n\nThey basically changed Morello to an item to counter vlad, with a meh Mpen stat on it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-02-24T21:06:46.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morello was staple first item for mages in ARAM, now that starter builds into Luden's, and morello can fuck off.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-02-24T14:48:13.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In terms of just raw usefulness as a stand-alone item, it is probably a nerf.\nBut what it does, _(along with the other changes)_ is give mages pivotal choices in their build path. Morellos is wayyyy stronger now in certain situations, and wayyyy weaker in others. So mages have to plan and adapt their builds more carefully according to the situation now, as opposed to just rushing morellos and building the same items every game.\n\nMeaning that unlike before, your item choices have a much more different and varied impact on the game.\nMorellos is now much stronger vs champs like Yasuo who lifesteal a lot in combat and in lane. But will be less useful against someone like Aurelion Sol who doesn't rely on healing, and uses sustained damage as opposed to burst, making the extra health less useful. And so buying it is a decision you have to weigh up now, instead of instabying it for the good stats and passives it gave.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-02-24T09:57:57.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its a completely different item. can't really talk in terms of nerfs and buffs.\n\ntechnically speaking i'd call it a buff, since it does what it was designed to do (apply grievous wounds) better.\n\nSimilar to when they changed Last Whisper from the regular item to focus more on tank busting. They lowered its AD but gave it a better passive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-02-24T08:36:45.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Buff/Nerf doesn't really apply since its not the same item anymore and doesn't look to do the same thing that it used to. Overall in terms of gold efficiency and stats and how good it was as a first staple item i would say its a nerf overall. But now functions a lot better as a complimentary item that you would get in situations that call for it.","replies":[]}]}
