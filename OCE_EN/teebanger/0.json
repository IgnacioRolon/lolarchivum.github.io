(Family emergency&#039;s, power outages, ect)\r\nIf I could make a suggestion, lower the wait time to 10 mins per game, because to be quite frank, 1/3 of an hour for one game is a bloody joke!!!\r\n\r\nNEVER!!! In my 18 years of gaming experience have I witnessed a game with such a disgraceful treatment of new players, punishing players who feed is something completely different to those who are new, and a line needs to be drawn in regards to this. I think it is totally Riots responsibility that if they want their game to expand that they create an environment that has the capacity to assist newer players, and the Honouring system, straight up doesn&#039;t cut it! As the environment I am currently witnessing has me wondering why I should invest the time to learn the game and perform better if people are going to bully and report me for having a bad game\r\n\r\nCurrently I&#039;m seriously struggling with this game, I have spent the past six months or so playing League, and have spent much and more on this, and I think it&#039;s seriously disheartening that such a good game can have such a poor delivery!!! 5/10 atm\r\n\r\nCome on Riot, Cut us newbs some slack!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-08-28T12:06:13.501+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like this rant is based off your inexperience in League of Legends.\nLow Priority Queue times only apply to those who AFK very often, like what Knuuckles said above (I for one will admit, I happen to fall under this category too often so I know all about Low Priority Queue). 20 minutes is the average wait time, there are other instances where some people may get 10 minutes and others even a whole 40 minutes of wait time.

For a period of time, my time was very unpredictable, and I knew I won't be able to play League of Legends at all since I only have small unpredictable windows of time to game at all, and thus I temporarily hopped onto DOTA 2 since there is a solo mode that I can pause anytime I want. This is different in League since even in a custom game you can't pause even if you're the only player in the game.\n\nUltimately, if you're also dealing with issues that split your game time, you really shouldn't be playing League of Legends. I'm not saying that you should go over to DOTA 2 or not, but if you do want to play a great MOBA that can be paused, then you should hop on over there.

But however I do disagree with what you said about new players. Riot should allow leeway for new players to learn the average length of a game, or just 'adapt' to not AFKing.\n\nEven if it means giving new players a 5 minute queue every time they AFK for their first month, it's still something.\n\nAlso, it's a bit extreme to tell people they shouldn't play league if they can't avoid leaverbuster. A player shouldn't have to stop playing simply because of a leaverbuster system.","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-08-29T02:21:19.293+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So us veterans who have played for 6 years without Once getting placed in Low Priority Queue or getting suspended or warned have to deal with shit games because you're unwilling to commit up to 50 minutes of time to a game? \nI don't want you playing this game, bugger off","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-08-29T08:16:57.968+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=fattyhotdogs,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=VAK5o2nq,comment-id=000100000001,timestamp=2016-08-29T02:21:19.293+0000)\n>\n> So us veterans who have played for 6 years without Once getting placed in Low Priority Queue or getting suspended or warned have to deal with shit games because you&#x27;re unwilling to commit up to 50 minutes of time to a game? \n> I don&#x27;t want you playing this game, bugger off\n\nCorrection: 'Us veterans who don't understand the concept of life outside of league of legends'","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-08-29T12:08:17.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mean the ones that work 37 hours a week to pay to go to uni on the two days per week tjat they don't work?

You get one free pass a day, how is that not enough?\n\nLike, for example, today I was playing an ARAM as {{champion:16}} , and built full healbot. My team was constantly running away from me while I was trying to heal them, tower diving on 1/4 life instead of letting me heal them up first, etc. I did everything I could to be a good healbot, but they still denied me heals, etc. I rage quit. They lost.\n\nShould I be punished for trying to be a 100% support character to a team that makes it hard for me to support them? I ragequit because I was 100% support in an ARAM, and my team didn't respect that. Fuck them, I DC'd.\n\nThey lost, I was glad.\n\nNormally, I would always see a game through.
