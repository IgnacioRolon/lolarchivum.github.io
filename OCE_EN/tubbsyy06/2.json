After 4 days of sitting around, deleting files\r\nand re-installing the entire game, I've had NO success.\r\nWhen i open the game, the patcher begins. It scans files, then get to step 2/2, and dies. At 33%, my KBps drops\r\ndrastically until it eventually reaches 0KBps.\r\n\r\nSomeone please help because this has been shitting me up the wall for days...\r\n\r\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-15T09:56:43.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried disconnecting and reconnecting your internet while it's at 0kbps?\n\nAlso, specifically at 33% sounds a bit suss.
