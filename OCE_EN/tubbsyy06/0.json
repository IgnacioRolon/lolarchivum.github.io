Similarly to Runescape,\r\nfor completing a task, such as \"Achieve 1 pentakill\" in the weekly challenges, rewarding the\r\nplayer with an IP, RP, champion, skin etc.\r\nEven though this is only a rough idea I think it would add a lot to the game and make it so much\r\nmore entertaining and exciting!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\ntubbsyy06","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-14T01:20:28.041+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Achieve one pentakill\" is pretty unrealistic for a weekly thing. However, the idea isn't too bad. Like, just if they gave us a chance to get some extra IP once in a while.","replies":[{"poster":"tubbsyy06","date":"2015-02-14T02:53:22.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was just using that as an example, they can be for doing anything not just kill-based activities","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-14T04:05:21.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know. You make a good suggestion though. Everyone who has felt the grind that is getting a 6300 champion could appreciate a little bit of bonus IP.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Socio","date":"2015-02-17T04:39:48.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not achievements?","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2015-02-11T04:30:43.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"don't think it'd work out that well...","replies":[{"poster":"tubbsyy06","date":"2015-02-14T00:44:47.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why's that?","replies":[]}]}]}
