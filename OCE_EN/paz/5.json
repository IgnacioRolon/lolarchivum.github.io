And although the Gambler tried to cast him out... it ate the gifts, and house, and gold! For its hunger? Nothing satisfied.\n\n\"Please, not now, not this time!\" the bride did cry.\n\nThe beast's response? To her it purred, \"This hunger's a burden, but it's the last time, I swear. So please, forgive.\"\n\nNow the creature's lies, so melodic and sincere, charmed that bride. And thus she failed to recognize when that demon's jaw unhinged. She screamed, just once. As I snapped her bones and crushed her limbs! Now that meal? It left me satisfied.\n\nSo cry if you want, boy, 'cause you had a chance to walk away. Instead you're the fool, the fool who let me in.\"\n\nThat is literally the ending of the story. At no point does it mention Tahm eating the Gambler.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-06-26T06:47:25.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"shhh, its not tf","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mythycal","date":"2015-07-02T11:32:36.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That bride MAY be Evelynn, if the gambler is Twisted Fate.

Tf's river background and his own tribe that exiled him, could easily be connected. I dont know if a riot personnel really denied any connection between those two, but i think it makes sense. Also, if you look at Tahm's abilities explanation, you will see Twisted Fate as the example opponent.This occurs nearly everytime, with the RIVAL each champion has( Teemo has as an example opponent his rival, Rumble, while Veigar has as an example opponent his own rival, Teemo, while.. BOTH Fate and Graves have as an example opponent Gangplank..i think you know the story, and so on with all the other champions).Therefore, it must not be a pure coinsidence.
