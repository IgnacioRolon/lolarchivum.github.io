I&#039;ve tried to talk to him but he doesn&#039;t care what I say. He thinks he is Bronze V because he gets troll teams, but really he just doesn&#039;t co-operate. He says a so called &#039;Broken Champion&#039; is hard, even though they are quite easy. Yes, he is better than me (far better!), I&#039;m only LVL 27, but he really thinks he is &#039;The Best OCE&#039;.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis Account (OCE): brodstar13579\r\nhttp://www.lolking.net/summoner/oce/3680352","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-06-23T12:16:53.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"tell your friend he's bad and should uninstall.","replies":[{"poster":"jonifob","date":"2015-06-23T23:04:53.542+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GoldenTomat0,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=qQQfsrjm,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-06-23T12:16:53.218+0000)\n>\n> tell your friend he's bad and should uninstall.\n\nTomato, we've been mate for a while.
