League is just one big toxic game regardless of the elo. Hell you even see challengers streaming flaming one another.\n\nDon't expect it to get any better once you hit gold etc either. It actually gets worse because everyone think's they're a pro player with a gold banner and everyone around them is wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-04-12T00:21:30.835+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every elo is toxic.

RIOT tried to create a behavior check back in 2012 or so to try and change the behaviors of players.

Platinum\n2. Silver\n3. Gold\n4. Bronze\n\nI think this is the case because of the fact that Silver players make up the largest portion of the League community. Not only that, but many silver players suddenly get an inflated ego if they've climbed out of Bronze due to the fact that they aren't in the lowest pit of the ranks, and therefore believe that they are better than most people, as they've climbed. I started last season in Bronze 3 for my first ranked season, so I know how it feels to go through that dark place. It wasn't easy going through all of Silver, due to this very reason. The egos that people get after proving that they aren't the worst are ridiculous. \n\nP.S. Same in Platinum, because since they're above gold they are automatically LCS quality.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-04-12T07:22:08.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol wait until you get into gold mate, you ain't seen nothing yet.

It should by the virtue of that stats alone, already makes Silver the most toxic group in a sense that a larger population also means you have more individual toxic players, assuming the percentage of them is constant across all leagues. And let's not even get into whether or not the percentage is constant.","replies":[]}]}
