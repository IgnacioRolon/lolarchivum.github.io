A nunu on the enemy team ints. I'm like, cool. But I guess what goes around comes around and the next game I get a 1/13 Nunu support. Then a Tahm jungle griefs and steals my cs and tries throwing me into the enemy team. Next a rengar had fifteen kills at seventeen minutes, 21 by the end of the 27 minute game. All back to back, all different teams. And the verbal harassment too. I'm getting paired up with people hellbent on losing before the game's begun. Lost two games, won one, lost another two, back to silver IV for the sixth time. I think I'm going to go nuts. How do you guys deal with this stuff? It's like it isn't enough for a silver player to win lane very consistently and play mid-late efficiently, you have to be plat quality to find a break when you want it.","replies":[{"poster":"69ms","date":"2017-04-02T18:23:28.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a thing called stop playing and have a fap","replies":[]},{"poster":"bo bo bum","date":"2017-04-01T05:50:51.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We all get a few bad teammates now and again, it's best to not focus that. I always try to reflect on what I could have done better, even if the game seems completely over .\n\nUsually if I lose 2-3 games in  row i'll play a nonranked game , practice a new role/champion to get my mind off it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LetsTwitch","date":"2017-04-01T05:27:17.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't play after losing, whether or not you think you're tilted is irrelevant. You will play worse than normal if last game your team fed hard.\n\nSecondly, if you cant climb doing that it's probably just your own skill isn't there yet. You might be mechanically good and outplay every one you verse but if you get caught and make the wrong decisions, you're still gonna lose most games.\n\nThirdly, just mute people who are toxic. Odds are in silver, any calls they make are either obvious or wrong.\n\nFourth, if you play a carry role, I prefer to pick ones who can peel themselves in fights, rather than rely on the team for help. An immobile champ like Kog'maw is difficult to play if the enemy team is competent enough to focus you and your team doesn't offer the protection you need.\n\nFinally, the games with feeders and trolls can be useful, if you normally stomp lane and can only win if you teamfight with a 5+ kill lead, that's a problem. You won't always win lane and you need to be able to play well from behind.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Warrior","date":"2017-04-02T13:56:01.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"First thing first, if you are not reporting them, they will be in your next or after 2-3 games eventually.\n2nd just ignore every one in team, and go for 1v9.  Don't trust their call or their action, if they call for something spam you call if you don't want to do it, or don't go for it.\n\nWhen it comes to climbing i would say 2 things\n\n1st Select champion pool and role and just spam it ( lose or win doesn't matter just spam like crazy)\n2nd Improve your game play, or tactic watch any streamer/high elo player and get an idea what item is good against champion/team losing/win situation \n\nThe only reason i stated this bcoz i once was Bronze Climb hard to silver then climb hard to Gold. Now going for Plat ( but journey was not easy as i have been banned 4 times till now) the struggle is real trust me banned again and i need to start from the scratch again 5th time.\n\nPlay Assassin role Mid/JG and help bot lane and easy win (specially night time)\n\nGood luck","replies":[]}]}
