It is like playing on a poorly optimized alpha game most of the time, none of the other online games i play suffer this issue, i have tested my connection and it is fine, it only happens with LOL.\r\nAnyone else have this issue / or fixes?","replies":[{"poster":"SinfulStranger","date":"2017-08-28T15:19:15.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup same shit a day later.  Eat my shit riot you worthless scabs. time to uninstall this free to play piece of shit once and for all. keep your toxic community and shitty optimization. Put some more time into maintaining your servers rather than mass producing new champs to cling onto your pile of shit player base in a sad pathetic desperate attempt to mask your rather dull and one dimensional game mechanics.  You are giving blizzard a run for their money for just how shit a developer can be when they think they are above their players. Well done on becoming just another worthless sell out bunch of assholes.  Good bye forever.","replies":[]}]}
