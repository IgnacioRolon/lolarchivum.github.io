People do it for the same reason people keep pressing the report button ingame. They know it achieves nothing, but if they don't at least do something the alternative is to accept that this is the only experience League offers now.\n\nAnd maybe there's the faint glimmer of hope that, before somebody steps in and reminds us that above all else the privacy of trolls must be protected, a player will see what's written and just maybe, they can pick up a leavebuster penalty and go do something else rather than be stuck with another toxic person for 20 minutes like Riot seems to prefer.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-08-15T04:14:08.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if you dismiss **Riot**'s claims, I find it hard to imagine how someone could believe that reports literally don't do anything.\n\nCheck any forum for League, and you'll find post after post of people talking about their punishments.
