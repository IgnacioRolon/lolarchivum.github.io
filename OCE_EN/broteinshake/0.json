I mean last season he was kinda of rubbish so it&#039;s always nice to see new champions become used again but lately I&#039;ve noticed a few things which annoy me.\r\n\r\nFirstly, if you don&#039;t have hard CC, you can&#039;t deny him from farming his Q. For no other reason except he just doesn&#039;t care about what you do. It happens with most champs I play but for example, in a game I played as Vladimir we were going along pretty normally, just kind of farming not really worrying about eachother. But when I hit 2 I started trading and I was doing everything right. I was keeping my E stacked at 4 and was poking him Q, it kept me at basically full health the whole time so I wasn&#039;t worried if he tried anything back. But he just didn&#039;t. Just kept farming his Q. \r\n\r\nI think the problem is his Q and his passive work way too well together. I couldn&#039;t deny farm because I didn&#039;t have cc, and he didnt care if i was attacking him because he had pots and enough life steal to keep him sustained. Obviously, because he can farm Q without me doing anything, by about lvl 3 or 4 he went in and had enough stacks finish me off one on one, even though he started the fight with like 3/4 of his health.\r\n\r\nIdk, maybe I&#039;m doing something wrong, everyones thoughts? Some tips would be nice too :)\r\n\r\n(I know in ranked you can counter-pick, but I like playing league for fun, therefore I don&#039;t concern myself with ranked)\r\n\r\ntia","replies":[{"poster":"Leonorn","date":"2015-06-18T10:18:07.915+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ur bad\n\nbut srs zone him from creeps and you all g in lane, late game just peel him like an orange since no gapcloser","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-06-19T03:11:58.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or like a banana?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-06-18T09:31:54.460+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is only problematic in low Leo solo queue, aside from that his early is pretty easy to capitalise on, as long as he isn't babysat 24/7.

You could also ask jungler for few early ganks to keep him alert. You'll zone him out easy peasy. Rush hextech revolver and eventually WotA. Just remember, with nasus, the more you deny him farm, the longer it takes for him to become that beast he is. Plus vlad turns into an equally scary beast late game just through farming as well so yeah you must've been doing something wrong there lol. If you really cant shake him off, maybe get that morrellocianclan thing coz that stuffs his passive up pretty bad. \n\nThe reason why at low elo Nasus is so good is because people dont shut him down and let him farm up. The last thing you want is a farmed up nasus because he wrecks through everything then.
