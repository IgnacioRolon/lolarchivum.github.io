I&#039;m starting to enjoy league less and less. Last season everyone complained about the assassin meta, it wasn&#039;t easy but you could just select someone with any hard cc and you could handle them. But every game nowadays I come up against a Garen, Naut or Cho&#039;Gath (especially Cho *shudders*) and they&#039;re just un-killable, and I find myself playing tanks a lot more now just out of necessity, even though I&#039;d rather play others.

Riot needs to realize that they are losing a lot of casual players who just want to have fun.
