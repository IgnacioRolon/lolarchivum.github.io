Take the time to try and main all lanes then u wont rage and feed like an ass cause u didn't get lane\n3) Start ranked when ur confident enough, not when ur depressed, your emotions will affect ur play, believe all the people on the boards <3\n\nThat's really all i got. OH and if u get into bronze 5, just yolo it, seriously, yolo all of ur ranked games, i did it, got out asap, aka 1 day, but as soon as ur in bronze 4 play serious, remember the toxic crap in bronze 5 :/","replies":[{"poster":"Critterous","date":"2015-05-12T05:17:25.381+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"now your stuck in bronze for ever and in low-priority queue 80% of the time\nDont listen to this guy","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-05-12T06:38:53.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was being helpful to the guy who made the convo, idm if he doesn't take my advice, but im being nice","replies":[{"poster":"Critterous","date":"2015-05-12T10:39:44.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you were nice you wouldn't troll our ranked team games","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-05-12T23:20:11.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i made that ranked team remember...","replies":[{"poster":"Critterous","date":"2015-05-13T09:58:28.633+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats nice, and you're also the person to be kicked out of it because you don't know how to manage your time... \"lets make this quick i got 10 minutes\"","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-05-15T00:13:47.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rage all u like, because like some people they have BETTER stuff to do than play LoL all the time, such as study, i left BECAUSE of Tutor","replies":[{"poster":"Critterous","date":"2015-05-15T20:57:48.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats poor time management... you could of told us that you didn't have time and we would of got someone else","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-05-18T00:14:07.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well im sorry, oka, im very sorry for:\n\n1.
