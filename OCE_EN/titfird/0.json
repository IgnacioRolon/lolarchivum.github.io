The launcher button makes the right noise, nothing happens after that. \r\nRepair doesnt work when clicked either. \r\nI have gone though many forums and tried many &quot;fixes&quot; but am yet to find a final fix. \r\nAny help would be great thankyou in advance","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-07T11:44:12.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What OS are you on?

If that's the case that fixes it, set your shortcut to the launcher to redirect to the admin version of launcher.exe instead of just the standard one.\n\nIf the repair isn't working (as in, you get an error when you attempt to repair) then it could mean that an external program is actively opening and editing files in League's program folder as it's running. Do you have any anti-virus or cleaner running in the background which you could disable until the patcher is completely finished and you've logged in?\n\nIf that hasn't worked, try going into your \"Internet Options\" (searchable from the Control Panel), reset everything back to their defaults, and then set the security level for the internet to \"Medium-Low\".\n\nIf that doesn't work, get back to me.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Crayzee","date":"2015-05-06T01:58:35.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are out of lick sir, i have had this problem for about 2 months and riot hasnt given me any help","replies":[{"poster":"titfird","date":"2015-05-09T03:53:18.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea ive had this issue for a very long time....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"titfird","date":"2015-05-05T08:18:29.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have found that spamming the launch button from startup as admin has a 6/10 chance of launching the game.
