Your obviously feminine name already screams that you're a girl and that you want attention, but please do not be so ignorant to introduce yourself as such. You're not going to get any sympathy from us by being like, \"_Oh my God, guys! I'm a girl! Hi_!\". We're not Twitch chat. We don't care about your gender. Stop using it to garner sympathy.\n\n>loves league as much as any of you reading my thread. \n\nPointless introduction to your topic. No one really cares how much you enjoy playing this game. Get to the point.\n\n>Recently my account was banned for using 3rd party programs (scripting I suppose)\n\nThe fact your assumption was instantly scripting just proves that you're guilty. It's the classic excuse for anything. \"_No, teacher, I assume they did this and that, but I didn't do it. Just a wild guess. Haha_!\". There is more than one reason to be banned for third-party programs aside from 'scripting'. Macros can get you banned, certain things that inject into the client can get you banned.\n\nNext, I assume you'll throw out generic programs millions of people use and add on a quick, \"_But that can't have got me banned_!\"\n\n>the only program that I use when I’m playing league is Discord and QQ (a Chinese app I use for chat), I don’t know why that would count as malicious.\n\nThere it is. Classic. Neither of them are malicious nor are they the reason behind your ban.\n\n>And I was just playing like any other day for the past 2 years since I started...\n\nDoubt it. I watched a few of your games. Sadly, I cannot watch those from when you were bronze, but I got enough. You're currently Plat 2 with high Master mechanics yet retain that Bronze/Silver decision making. Your Vayne is insanely good, far better than mine and my peak rank was Diamond 1. Granted, I am an Annie one-trick, but I can play most champions with considerable ease.\n\n>This is the only account I have, it’s become a part in my life now\n\nThen why script?\n\n>i am legit bad at computers, there’s no way I’d know how to script). Ask anyone on my friend list and they will confirm that I am telling the truth.\n\nAmusing that you're 'bad with computers', but you manage to play League at a high mechanical level. You can attack move really precisely for someone being so bad with computers. Don't give me that nonsense that it's not the same because it is. My mother, who can't stand computers, can hardly play League, yet my buddy who is a professional I.T techy person and he grasped it easily enough. Regardless, hardly an excuse when those sites have step-by-step guides on how to set them up. No knowledge required.\n\n>Ask anyone on my friend list and they will confirm that I am telling the truth\n\n[scarra laugh]\n\n>I have spent more than 700AUD on this account\n\nAnd? I've spent close to $6,000 on this game. Only now have I grasped the sense that I am wasting money when I get perm banned every second week. No one cares. If you didn't want to waste $700, don't cheat.\n\n>I have submitted tickets to Riot, but they don’t even reply now as they think I am just lying.\n\nBecause you are lying and you're wasting their time.\n\n>Can someone please help me?\n\nI did. :)\n\n>Why did I get banned?\n\nYou cheated.

They're very easy for Riot to detect with perfect ease because they use packets to do what they do. Do you really think Riot can't detect that?

You know what I have never seen? I have never seen Riot make a mistake in detecting scripts or client modifications. That system is automated and only has a set list of exploits that it sweeps for (no it wont ban you for a regular ass program). They update this list of exploits by monitoring exploit sites. \n\nTo put it simply if you got banned for it then you had 3rd party in your client (or used on your account)  at some point. Now you can say that you didn't but this is pretty much an undeniable fact. There are ways 3rd party programs could of been used on your account without your knowledge. Someone could have logged in elsewhere and cheated. You could of downloaded a bodgy LoL related scam program that infected your client (one claiming to give you RP etc) or someone you know could have scripted on it at some point. \n\nBut none of those factors really change anything.

If your ban gets overturned because \"Hey Riot it was someone else that did it not me!\" then that sets a precedence for anyone else who gets banned for 3rd party to say the same thing and also try and get unbanned.\n\nRiot have absolute knowledge of what information the LoL client/accounts send so if they say 3rd party was used on your account then they are indisputably correct. They don't however have complete omniscience or omnipresence, they have no idea what person is behind the keyboard. I am sure this isn't hard for you to understand. Even if it wasn't you per-se they can't lift your ban because they don't know whether you are telling the truth.\n\nLets say,  to drive the nail even further in with another hypothetical. Even if Riot had some kind of way to tell specifically who made the offense and it wasn't you they still can't let your account go unbanned. If they did everyone now has a way around it. Everyone could just tell someone else to cheat on their account for them then give an alibi to get their account unbanned.\n\nFor what its worth I think you're lying (statistically speaking this is most likely) but even if you aren't then that makes your case a necessary causality to uphold the lines of law Riot has put into its game terms.

I am sure some people have accounts hacked due to them not being careful and have them scripted on. However as I have said before even if this makes you \"innocent\" it doesn't mean they can unban you. And for 99% of cases the person who cheated did so willingly.

If Riot lets cheaters know specifically what got them banned then they have information to use in improving the cheats ability to avoid detection.\n\n> **I’m wondering if deleting ‘lockfile’ in the folder will trigger it because I need to delete it in order to start the client. **\n\nI doubt it, that is an old known issue that many people had.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-01-02T07:36:06.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me tell you this to relieve you.
