After that I bought another unranked account which after 3 weeks I got to P5 before it was permanently banned because of levelling up by botting (I had no idea this was done by the person I bought it off). I have contacted RIOT however they are saying they wont help me, which I find ridiculous as the only person they are punishing is me who has done nothing wrong.\r\n\r\nI would like to think that there is a less tedious way to get to where I was other than starting a new account, levelling it up to 30, acquiring the BE needed to buy the minimum 20 champs needed for ranked and then climbing to my previous elo. I enjoy playing this game however it gets frustrating playing with the lower elo players who just abuse and blame a lot of the time and would rather chase an enemy half way across the map over taking a free baron (I had forgotten how bad it was). I really dont want to have to go through that again, I just want to be playing at the level I was with people who I am on the same page as.\r\n\r\nSo... what can I do?\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. What is the reason the account I bought was picked up? I know of other players who have levelled up using botting however still have their accounts (or so i believe). Not to sound cocky but was it because of how fast i was climbing? Or was I reported by another player?","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-03-15T07:53:52.331+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"It was a bought account, riot says thats against the rules so instabans you","replies":[{"poster":"iplaytowin234","date":"2018-03-15T08:05:45.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I don't get some people's need to post useless comments.

Bottom line is that \"transferring ownership\" of accounts is a blatant breach of the ToU and EULA, and practically guaranteed to result in a perma-ban. Not only that, but using 3rd party software is also a blatant breach of the ToU and EULA, and practically guaranteed to result in a perma-ban (and practically every account that is up for sale was levelled using bots).\n\nYou ask in your post \"What is the reason the account I bought was picked up?\", and you have been given not one but **two** *very* good reasons (botting and buying).","replies":[{"poster":"iplaytowin234","date":"2018-03-16T10:29:17.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey man. Fair enough reply. After thinking about it now I know the ban is completely justified, was just looking for a quick way to 30. However my question at the end is better worded as: 'why was my account picked up while others have not been?'. I know the reasons it was banned however I know of plenty of other bought accounts that have not been banned. Why was mine banned and theirs not?\n\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-03-19T15:50:37.361+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They do. Who are you to say they don't? lol.
