I bought this account 3 weeks ago (which I know a lot of people do, however it was unranked when I bought it and I have since reached plat 5). So it must be that the account was levelled up by someone using automated bots for the purpose of selling it which I was unaware of.\r\nHowever they are banning my account now thus the only person being punished is me. I find this completely unfair. As the game is now it is too time consuming and boring levelling up an account and gaining the blue essence to play ranked so I think it is ridiculous that RIOT expects each player who wants a new account to have to do this.\r\n\r\nMy main issue is that I am the only person being punished here however I have done nothing wrong. No one gains anything from banning my account so what is the point of it? All they are doing is upsetting me, who has put a lot of time and effort into this game and thoroughly enjoy it. \r\n\r\nWhy wont RIOT help me? Once again they are not assisting any of their stakeholders.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-03-15T21:49:55.823+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"not unfair. totally justified.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2018-03-15T22:56:04.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Loooool you're  a good troll poster.

You *bought* the account, which is a *blatant* breach of the ToU and EULA (and also *technically* illegal). Regardless of how the account was levelled up, it would have still been banned.\n2. I can guarantee that *at least* 99.99% of accounts for sale were levelled using bot programs. There's no excuse for not knowing that.\n3. There is literally no reason for Riot to give players the option of creating an account at any given level other than level 1. The only reason you want that is so you can continue to break the rules without any significant consequence, otherwise why would you even need/want an additional account considering the addition of uncapped levelling? (and before you say anything about being \"stuck in elo hell\", that's complete BS. You'd only be stuck in a given ELO because you're not significantly better than the people in that elo)\n4. I can guarantee that *at least* 99% of accounts that are botted and/or transfer \"ownership\" get banned. You are *not* the only player who has been banned for this (not by a long shot), and you will not be the last (also not by a long shot).\n5. Being a \"stakeholder\" (which I seriously doubt, by the way) and/or having payed money on the game doesn't entitle you to any preferential treatment.
