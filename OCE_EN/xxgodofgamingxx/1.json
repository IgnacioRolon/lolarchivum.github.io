Before the latest patch my workaround was to click 'launch' as soon as the launcher pops up. Somehow this worked before the patch but now everytime I hit launch it calculates file differences then nothing happens.

Main one to look out for is the changing DNS.\n\nIf that fails, could you test your connection using [this tool](http://netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/)? It's the one Riot gets you to use if they want to diagnose your connection. You need to have Java installed and enabled in order to use it.\n\nNote any things which appear in red in the synopsis. **Do not post the entire log.** You may have already had to do this while using the troubleshooting page, so just use that if you still have it up. Also, could you provide me with your ISP and OS?\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
