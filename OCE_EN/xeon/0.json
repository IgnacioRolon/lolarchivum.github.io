In the late game my internet died and I couldn&#039;t rejoin back in time because me internet is slow to boot up. So the next day (Today) I go to queue up with my buddy and we have to wait the 20 min AFK ban. So we wait the ban out and go into queue. We get a match and both of us accept and then everyone accepts and we should enter champion select. But both my buddy and my client don&#039;t load the champion select. So after about a min we get kicked out of queue and we are told that we have a 5 minute ban because not choosing a champion. So now we have to wait the 5 minutes plus the the 20 minute AFK ban so in total 25 minutes just to get in a match. I don&#039;t know why this happened but now I&#039;m annoyed because basically we are waiting half a match to get into one. If so could someone help me with anything that could be done or do we just have to put up with this.","replies":[{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2016-10-21T11:49:59.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the same problem now!
