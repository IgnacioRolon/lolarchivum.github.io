As always, it's best to provide as much information as you can.\n\nAs a note, if you use public computers it's always a good idea to check for suspicious programs running in the background using Task Manager and if there's any suspicious hardware attached to the computer itself, as these may indicate the use of key-loggers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Summoner threep","date":"2017-07-18T19:09:43.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Report it asap\n\nSame thing happened on my main account except I didn't notice as I was on hiatus and it got Permabanned and support won't reopen my account saying they are not responsible for the security of my account....","replies":[]},{"poster":"yohira","date":"2017-07-18T13:26:51.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've changed my password to regain access to my account.
