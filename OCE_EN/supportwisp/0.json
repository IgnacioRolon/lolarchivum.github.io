Now I noticed in the game you had 8 hours ago you were against 3 AP opponents in Akali, Cho'Gath and an AP Nasus in which you opted for a Sunfire Cape early in the game. What you could have instead opted for would be a locket for example which would have helped your team survive more.\n\nOn the note of Sunfire, While I do see the benefits of Sunfire being a strong item on Nautilus I think it should be reserved for when you are already a big chunk ahead and you need armor. Even though Sunfire is a defensive item, as far as items tanky supports can buy I would put it on the offensive end as the passive only increases the damage you do and doesn't buff your team as well. You might want to consider swapping this out for buying knights vow more and considering playing around with redemption in your builds as well.\n\n---\n\nMoving on from items the next thing I noticed was your kill participation. May I ask, so you find yourself roaming a lot? Nautilus is a very strong ganker and I feel like it's something that you can really take advantage of in the early game. \n\nYou just backed and have mobility boots? Consider dropping by mid lane for a few wards to keep them protected and try for a gank while you are there. You could also set up dual ganks with your jungler or possibly an invade to get vision in their bot side jungle.\n\n---\n\nOther than that it can be a bit hard to give advice off of scores and builds alone, so if you have anything specific you would like me to give advice on or any questions let me know and I'll be sure to answer.\n\nAlways make sure you are communicating with your team and your ADC as to what you want to do next, it'll help them follow up when it happens.\n\nGood luck in your games.\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"SupportWisp","date":"2017-01-06T09:14:24.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi and thank you!\n\nRegarding the sunfire cape; I tend to pick it up when I feel my ADC is pretty useless, It reassures me that I can apply more damage for what the AD misses. But when you put it like that, if my team can survive for longer the more damage output they can do. I read a guide recently for Nauti Supps, some master player on moba fire. Apparently I don't actually need to build that tanky anymore? More of a CC champ than a heavy tank?\n\nI tend not to roam too much as very often my ADC will get tilted that I left them so they couldn't get as much farm and/or get killed in the lane, putting the blame on me. Which as the game goes on they refuse to co operate with any plays. I suppsoe written communication would prevent that though so I will definitely try that in future. But I also find people are very one minded in their game, it's their lane they need to win before they can go elsewhere. And when I do roam I tend to miss time it so I may be at top lane, but doing so we lost bot tower and my ADC starts to flame.\n\nFor Specifics;\n\nWhat to do when the ADC clearly isn't very aggressive, won't push for kills and insists on sitting under tower? along with getting annoyed when I leave them to there own devices?\n\nWe lost the first turret, do I stay bot with my adc or try and roam alot more, assuming my ADC will stay at the first turret out of base to farm?\n\nBot lane is being persistently ganked by mid and Jg, is there any strategy apart from warding to know when they will arrive?

Always keep in mind that when you are reading guides you should always look at more than one source. Do research for many guides and find patterns along with your own experiments to see what works best for you.\n\n--- \n\nOnto specifics:\n\n> What to do when the ADC clearly isn't very aggressive, won't push for kills and insists on sitting under tower? along with getting annoyed when I leave them to there own devices?\n\nSometimes it might be the case that a player is just more passive than they are aggressive which is ok. However I would recommend the best way to try and get your ADC to be aggressive is communication. Ask them how they want to play the lane and give your own input. When you are ahead or think you can fight, communicate that as you hit a power spike on your way back into Lane for example and use your engage power as a Nautilus to start a fight.\n\n---\n\n> We lost the first turret, do I stay bot with my adc or try and roam alot more, assuming my ADC will stay at the first turret out of base to farm?\n\nThis in my opinion can be situational and depends on what the enemy team is doing for the most part. My general rule of thumb is, if their bot lane has roamed elsewhere after killing your tower, as a support you should probably follow them to defend your towers elsewhere. Apart from that even if they are still pushing bot, if you see an opportunity where you think you can get a kill for your team elsewhere use your own judgement as to when or when not to go for it. The best way to learn with roaming is experience.\n\n---\n\n> Bot lane is being persistently ganked by mid and Jg, is there any strategy apart from warding to know when they will arrive? (along with the fact they can dive the tower anyway and kill both ad and I)\n\nFor this, there isn't really a way to tell for sure when they can arrive however there are some patterns that you can look out for. The first one is the position of the Minions in mid wave. If the enemy mid is trying to push than that gives a good tell that they want to move into the fog of war. A good way to check if they are pushing is getting used to using the f keys (F1,2,3,4,5) inbetween each wave to see how waves in enemy lanes are doing.\n\nAs for the junglers however this can be a bit more tricky but there are some tricks that you can use to get a close idea. If both junglers have a similar clear speed, you can use your junglers position on the map to track where you think the enemy jungler is on their clear. This can be tricky and won't always be 100% reliable. However it can tell you times to play some extra attention to the map/wards. Always be prepared for a gank though. Sometimes they strike when you least expect it xD\n\n---\n\nI hope that this helps, if you need me to clarify on anything that I have said let me know. Good luck in your games!\n\n~Elam","replies":[]}]}]}]}
