Tis&rsquo; blasphemy to condemn treasure!\r\nTreasure, not petty mess! How dare you, the \r\nStorm&rsquo;s Fury, disdain my hard earned rewards.\r\nThis medallion, whose nomadic owner\r\nPerished in the heart of Azir&rsquo;s domain,\r\nWas the result of a great eagle&rsquo;s eye\r\nAnd bravery that would send Darius \r\nAnd his men retreating in complete dread. \r\nJANNA\r\n(Aside) The sight of a blade would surely cause Ez&rsquo;\r\nTo quickly Arcane Shift to my bosom\r\nWhere the villains would face my Howling Gale.\r\n(To Ezreal) Your escapades have brought you some riches,\r\nAlthough finding them in this disorder\r\nWould be like searching for a tear of joy\r\nIn an ocean of Amumu&rsquo;s despair.\r\nA room plan or sketch would alleviate \r\nThis troublesome locale &ndash;\r\nEZREAL\r\n-\tWho needs a map\r\nWhen the greatest treasure is equip-ed\r\nTo my wrist? (Shows off the talisman on his wrist) -\r\nJANNA\r\n-\t(Sighs) Of course not, young explorer.\r\n(Aside) I fear another story of travels\r\nAnd times at the depths of the rift in which\r\nA careful mystic shot slayed a villain. \r\n(To Ezreal) Regardless, unless a frozen whirlwind\r\nSummoned by Anivia detach me,\r\nI am here in your abode and shall stay.\r\nYour &ldquo;displays of skill&rdquo; have earned devotion.\r\nAlthough, your request to clean your findings\r\nWith my Zephyr dares to breach our friendship.\r\nMy mighty Monsoon has been known to tear\r\nEven great Juggernauts from their holding.\r\nTo use my divine magic for dusting\r\nIs, dare I say Ezreal, near insulting.\r\nEZREAL\r\nBut surely, great enchantress, your Mana\r\nWould not be dropped by such a simple task\r\nWhen sending giants flying is so easy.\r\n(The sound of chimes and trumpets, initially quiet but progressively louder)\r\nJANNA\r\nAlas, I fear our, time isolated\r\nComes to a sudden end young prodigy.\r\n(Looking around the room) Bard, Bard, wherefore art thou great caretaker?\r\nDeny thy capricious allegiance to\r\nSupport me to Cleanse this horrid abode,\r\nOr, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love\r\nAnd I will no longer be with Ezreal.\r\n(Enter Bard through a Magical Journey, followed by Zilean)\r\n ZILEAN\r\nAh! The Wondering Caretaker spoil me!\r\nAlthough, Ezreal&rsquo;s cottage does disturb one&hellip;\r\nEZREAL\r\n(Shock that becomes sarcasm) Great chronokeeper, I am honoured \r\nAlthough, your visit bewilders me -\r\nBARD\r\n-\tToot.\r\nZILEAN\r\nPoor child, your ignorance doth astound me.\r\nOne&rsquo;s seemingly rightful place can quickly\r\nBe removed, by eventuality \r\nOr by the grand oppression of others.\r\nThe thought of replacing residence here,\r\nOf all places, disgusts me however.\r\nLive in fear, not that your home be stolen\r\nBut that your being meet a similar fate.\r\nThese walls may not protect you, nor can I.\r\nRivers, jungles and even one&rsquo;s allies\r\nAre rarely enough to deter prowlers.\r\nEZREAL\r\nTrue, one as vulnerable as myself,\r\nArcane Shift aside, can&rsquo;t be in comfort.\r\nHad Bard&rsquo;s portal held a greater villain\r\nI may have found myself in the domain\r\nOf the Shadow Isles, at Yorick&rsquo;s whim.\r\nHowever, I remain steadfast until\r\nGreat Twisted Fate to high Piltover hill\r\nShall come against me &ndash; \r\nZILEAN\r\n-\tThat shall not happen.\r\nHis Destiny will not cross yours today\r\nBut a different travelling tyrant\r\nDoth make his expeditious arrival.\r\nJANNA\r\nUnless this villain wish to face a gust\r\nPowerful enough disengage wars,\r\nHe be best avoiding this residence.\r\nBARD\r\n(Urgently) Pah-pa-rah, toot toot doot ring toot ring ting\r\nZILEAN\r\nI fear our peaceful time come to an end.\r\n(A growing, bubbling pool of murky water appears centre stage)\r\nEZREAL\r\nWhat sorcery is this? Intervention\r\nBy Nami? No. The Tidecaller never\r\nDirties aqua. A fouler demon&rsquo;s work.\r\n(Everyone steps away from the pool as it grows)\r\nZILEAN\r\nFair is foul and foul is fair.\r\nHover through thy fog and filthy air.\r\nSomething wicked this way comes.\r\n(Loudly, at the pool) Show yourself, interloper! -\r\nBARD\r\n-\tToot ring ting\r\n(Aside) O&rsquo;, bold and we&iuml;rd chronokeeper whose fate\r\nIs surely safe from the beast below&rsquo;s bite,\r\nTo toy with mortal&rsquo;s fragile, foolish minds\r\nIs a true sin. Divine foresight vanish\r\nWhen identifying the massive beast? \r\nFor shame! The monarch of aqua impose\r\nHis presence and ye lure him out to pick\r\nAt the mind of the beyond ancient King.\r\nLet ye onlookers know that Tempered Fate\r\nDoth favour the honest and loyal ones\r\nWho the demon seeketh, not the trickster.\r\n(Enter Tahm Kench, Ezreal and Janna gasp, Zilean smiles)\r\nJANNA\r\nBeware young prodigy, pray to Xerath\r\nThat the River King&rsquo;s appetite be quash&rsquo;d\r\nElse your fate rest with his gnashing, vile teeth. \r\nTAHM KENCH\r\nCareful who you label vile, &ldquo;Storm&rsquo;s Fury,&rdquo;\r\nWater forgets the names of the drown-ed.\r\nMy appetite may only be sated\r\nBy the weak-willed and tormented persons,\r\nTo assume the virtuous find themselves\r\nWithin my belly is frankly churlish.\r\nWhether such inflicted souls are present\r\nRemains to be seen &ndash; \r\nEZREAL\r\n-\t(With caution) I respect thee king\r\nBut to bestow yourself without notice\r\nIn our presence requires explanation\r\nZILEAN\r\nDisregard that brash lad whose tongue pursues,\r\nTell me, ancient monarch, of times long lost.\r\nTAHM KENCH\r\nI will not satiate your desires, time lord.\r\n(To Ezreal) My presence need little explanation,\r\nAll the world&rsquo;s a river &ndash; and I&rsquo;m its King.\r\nHowever, perhaps my existence here\r\nProves fruitful. Your inner-demons hide well\r\nBut pride and hubris eats away at you.\r\nMisery has a delectable taste\r\nAnd my maw awaits a meal such as you.\r\nEZREAL \r\nFie! You consider me weak-minded, villain?\r\nTAHM KENCH\r\nPerhaps not pathetic as a Yordle,\r\nBut their will together is impressive.\r\nYou may satisfy if your confidence\r\nDoes not wane. Stronger men have been fell-ed.\r\nJANNA\r\nSurely the fields of battle quench your thirst.\r\nOne as simple and bony as Ezreal\r\nWould leave an appetite as this coin would (points to Ancient Coin).\r\nThe forlorn beings of the Shadow Isles,\r\nSuch as the Gravedigger would satiate.\r\nTAHM KENCH\r\nLet me see. (takes the coin) Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him,\r\nJanna, a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.\r\nMen such as Yorick deserve pure respect.\r\nThis measly squire earns little more than teeth (eats the coin).\r\nBARD\r\nPah-pa-rah ring\r\nEZREAL\r\n(more angry than scared) Enough of this madness!\r\nWhy, in times of peace, must my place see battle\r\nWith demons, wizards and gods intruding?\r\nZILEAN\r\nMarksmen and enchanters may never rest\r\nIn horror that a deadly combatant\r\nCharge, or otherwise materialize \r\nInto their once undisturbed residence.\r\nTAHM KENCH\r\nTis true, to object is simply futile.\r\nJANNA\r\n(More or less to herself) Two parties, both alike in dignity\r\nIn fair Piltover, where we lay our scene,\r\nFrom plain farming break to new mutiny,\r\nWhere a gank&rsquo;s blood make civil hands unclean.\r\nFrom forth fatal lanes of these two foes\r\nA pair of loyal allies cling to life\r\nWhose fearsome company dare overthrows\r\nDoth with their deaths bury their teammates strife.\r\n&ldquo;&rsquo;O brave new world that has such people in&rsquo;t!&rdquo;\r\nThey cry before clashing their bloodied blades.\r\nYet to their anger doth colleagues commit.\r\nTo view the stage or provide needed aid,\r\nThat is the question. But pointless bloodshed\r\nSimply help to set the duo&rsquo;s deathbed\r\nEZREAL\r\nTrue Janna, leave us be or ignite rage\r\nThat flood through Piltover&rsquo;s veins, Caitlyn&rsquo;s gun\r\nIs quick to eliminate murderers.\r\nZILEAN\r\nPerhaps my presence is less occasion \r\nAnd more trouble. Let us leave, Caretaker,\r\nBefore ninjas, gamblers or Void creatures\r\nTravel to our locale!\r\nBARD\r\nRing toot toot ring!\r\n(Aside) To abuse my powers for trivial\r\nLocomotion is crude, albeit fun&hellip;\r\n(Exit Bard and Zilean)\r\nTAHM KENCH\r\nDelay, my swift, fleeing acquaintances,\r\nTime to Cooldown impedes my excursion!\r\n(Aside) Pray that Heimerdinger be unprepar&rsquo;d \r\nBecause my assiduous appetite\r\nMay, like myself, be not easily bench-ed\r\n(Exit Tahm Kench)\r\nJANNA\r\nAlthough lesser evil than those villains,\r\nI&rsquo;m afraid that I will roam past these walls.\r\nMuch greater aid than mere babysitting \r\nIs needed elsewhere. Take care, explorer.\r\n(Exit Janna)\r\nEZREAL\r\nWait! Leave not without me, for loneliness\r\nLeaves one vulnerable and without your\r\nEye of the Storm, my scared soul and body\r\nBe quick to dismantle by one whose burst\r\nSquishes me were I a mere mortal bug.\r\n(Exit Ezreal)\r\nTHE END","replies":[{"poster":"THE RlVER KlNG","date":"2016-07-28T03:07:17.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is genius.
