[HUMOUR]","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I was looking at the stuff for the latest PBE cycle (http://www.surrenderat20.net/2015/08/825-pbe-update.html), and I ended writing a humourous rant post to my friend, which I&#039;ll post here.\n\n\nRito Games:\nBuy PROJECT Skins so you can buy more PROJECT Skins, so you can get more PROJECT Skins Goodies!\nWe&#039;ll even throw in a First Strike Bonus where you buy more of more PROJECT Skins, to get more of buying PROJECT Skins with Special PROJECT Skins Champion Loading Screen Skins. Don&#039;t worry if you don&#039;t buy PROJECT Skins right away as PROJECT Skins, we&#039;ll disable the PROJECT Skins for 2 days, for which afterwards you can buy the PROJECT Skins for a reduced price, with just regular PROJECT Skins Champion Loading Screen Skins, for a limited time only! Don&#039;t forget, if you buy more PROJECT Skins, and your team buys more PROJECT Skins, we&#039;ll give you special PROJECT Skins for Minions too! \nAlso help your team enjoy buying PROJECT Skins, with PROJECT Skins synchronised recalls with more PROJECT Skins the better for PROJECT Skins ultimate effects for PROJECT Skins! Don&#039;t forget to stock up your PROJECT Skins profile with PROJECT Skins Summoner Icons, and the Optical Enhancer Ward Skin! So buy PROJECT Skins!\n\n\nDisclaimer: This does not in any way represent an accurate statement from Riot Games. Also, grammatical correctness was intentionally not a focus :P\n\nBut seriously, even though the PROJECT package looks awesome, it&#039;s a lot of time that Riot spends on making cosmetic things that could possibly be used to bring in more useful features (replays, anyone?)","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-09-01T10:01:57.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> it's a lot of time that Riot spends on making cosmetic things that could possibly be used to bring in more useful features (replays, anyone?)\n\nYou do realise that the team that works on skins is different from the teams that works on other features, right? You can't just send someone from the skin team to, for example, the player behaviour team or vice verse, it doesn't work that way.","replies":[]}]}
