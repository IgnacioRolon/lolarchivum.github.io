Needless to say, I was excited and downloaded it. After trying it out, I have a whole bunch of bugs and issues that I would like to point out (some may be mentioned already). Problem is I want to report Bugs AND Feedback, but I feel I have to report them together, since I have a list of things.\n\nOverall I am liking the new design, smooth aesthetic, nice animations, though you have to take into consideration that you don't make features that are available in the current client more inefficient/inconvenient to use in the alpha by being too fancy/modern in your layout, art and animations.\n\n---Friends List---\n[UI] I don't like the design of the friends list popups, I'd prefer having icons for a person's rank (like the current client), rather than just text \"Bronze III\". Or at least have coloured text, something to distinguish tiers.\n[UI] Offline friends should look similar to the current client, listing as name only (and with reduced height), so they are easily distinguishable from online friends, and take up less space. I do not need to see summoner icons of offline friends in the list. If I want to, I can just hover over their name. League Friends, the mobile chat app has this problem too.\n[UI] Current client distinguishes between different statuses in the colour of a summoner's name. LCU Alpha has only a small circle in the corner of the summoner's icon to distinguish between online statuses. This is a lot harder to see at a glance who's online, in-game etc. Now I know this is the new aesthetic you have been pushing but there's gotta be some better way. League Friends has the small circle to the left of the summoner's icon, in its separate area. Perhaps this may be an alternative. I would most prefer the current client's implementation.\n[?] In-game status colour is now blue? I could get used to it, just a bit confusing.\n[?] Friends list blanks out/takes a while to load on login.\n\n---Options---\n[BUG] Options dialogue window appears in top left hand corner of screen before repositioning to the centre.\n[BUG] I pressed a blank button in the options and the client closed to be replaced by a window that says \"Processed __ Files\" What is this button? Does this not need some kind of confirmation? [SCREENSHOT ATTACHED]\n[?] Pressing Save in options does not close options dialogue (this may or may not be intended)\n\n---Champion Select---\n\n[BUG] Selecting champion and summoner spells were slow to update, I had to click several times and/or wait 5 seconds between change. The spinning circle would sometimes pop up on the changing icon too.\nHaving to rely on text for telling whether people are picking champions or locked in, is not ideal, needs highlighting, like the current client.\n[BUG] ARAM timer countdown tends to skip numbers.\n[BUG] No BOOM sound when on final 10 second countdown in champion select.\n\n---Login Screen---\n\n[BUG] When logging in, will say \"The login queue is currently busy. Please try again later.\" Need to click several times to log in. Or even clicking on language and then region required for it to finally log in.\n[BUG] Login button text disappeared!!! Happens sometimes.\n[BUG] If I type in invalid password, \"Invalid username/password combination. Please try again\" will pop up. If I fix it, no matter how many times I press enter or Sign In, it won't update or try to relogin. Instead, if I fiddle around with the Region and language it will eventually log in, after a delay (may be related to the first bug I mentioned about Login Screen).\n\n---Post-match Screen---\n[INFO] No detailed graphs or stats, link in top right to Match History Website. Need stats such as Turrets destroyed, Inhibitors destroyed\n[UI] More contrast in colours and sizes of fonts, make it more colourful like the current client! Currently looks a little washed out and faded. Start with making player names blue and red like in the current client and see how it looks.\n[BUG] Item icons momentarily disappear (turn black) when hovered on in post match screen\n\n---Lobby Chat--\n[BUG] Somehow opened up a chat that was named () when clicking. Did not seem to appear in left sidebar as a valid chat.\n[BUG] Some messages can take a few seconds to send.\n\n---Website Features---\nThe Report a Bug and Report Feedback features don't fit in with what feedback I like to give out.\nI have noticed at least 7+ bugs, and reporting each one individually via the \"Report a Bug\" page feels woefullly inefficient.\nOn the other hand, for report feedback, does this include bugs? How does feedback get classified as Riot gets it, especially when feedback could be on multiple different things, some bugs, some feedback? What gets priortised? And yes, I know you have focus areas, but that's not what I'm talking about. EDIT: I went and submitted feedback and I guess it directed me to submit separate feedback for each of the different part of the client. I guess I separated my feedback into sections here, so I copy pasted what I had into each feedback box.\n\n---General---\nMore coloured text and visual contrast to distinguish features, rather than having users struggle to distinguish between two different pieces of text, or having to read \"picking\" as text in champion select.\nIf in doubt for a feature implementation/layout, go with what's in the current client, but here in the alpha you have the opportunity to make everything look consistent. The current client does look a little inconsistent due to patching of various areas over the years.\n\nThis is the feedback I have for now.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Bad KhaZix","date":"2016-06-13T03:45:25.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I clicked the strange blank button too.
