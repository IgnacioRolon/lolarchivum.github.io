I have played with bots in the past and it sucks, it's basically a waste of time and feels horrible.\n\nTo answer, we are aware of the botting problem and have teams both in NA and locally in OCE trying to improve our detection and banning process. We check for and ban bots daily, sometimes in larger batches after a few days, but unfortunately at this point they are required to play some games in order to be detected so the lowest levels will always be affected.\n\nI've banned thousands of bots myself, and while it is satisfying to smack em down when they're just about to hit 30 we try to ban them ASAP so that they affect as few games as possible.\n\nI encourage you to keep reporting bots you meet and tell others to do the same. A simple \"Bot\" in the end of game report comment goes a long way to help us when combined with our other investigation methods. I'm happy to answer any other questions you have on the topic. (although can't talk detection methods)\n\nThanks,\nAlso not a bot","replies":[{"poster":"OffTheGrid","date":"2016-03-10T09:23:37.720+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply man, leaps and bounds better than the reply i got for my ticket (ironically it seemed like a copy-paste answer).\n\nIts super reassuring to know that you guys are really trying, keep doing your thing :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"jurgenfriedrich","date":"2016-03-10T08:01:03.417+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"banning harmless bots\nnot banning feeder and AFKs\nthanks riot","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-03-10T11:04:16.040+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you're playing on EUW I can't speak to what your local Rioters might be doing.
