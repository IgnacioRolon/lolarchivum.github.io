In every case I've seen like this, the account shares either a username, password, or both with another service, and as a result can be easily breached if those services ever get their user account databases leaked.\n\nSupport was extremely strict with policy in this case but your ticket was submitted many months ago. I am moving them more towards leniency when dealing with cases where it is evident that an account has been stolen, not shared.\n\nI've un-banned your account and sent you a prompt for another password reset. Please be sure to follow through on that and be sure that the password is strong and unique.

I got onto riot support within 2 days but I was already permanently banned and riot support pretty much told me the same thing.\n\nIt's pretty sad to see my 100's of days spent on league of legends go down like this:\n\nThe request:  https://puu.sh/AsEpp/a46c3b1559.png\n\nWhat I come back to when I try to log in: https://puu.sh/AsKdr/5127fc7ff6.png\n\nThey played 5 games only on the account before they got it banned, the last 3 of which are pre-made with some of their friends I presume. Basically I had my account taken for a joyride.\n\nI have all my game logs and would be able to provide anything support needs but they pretty bluntly responded saying it was banned for \"scripts, hacks, exploits or unauthorised third-party programs in League of Legends\"  and that context doesn't matter regardless. If you could help me in anyway I would greatly appreciate it.

Why didn't you notice this sooner if there were one or even multiple unauthorised transactions under your account when you clearly weren't using it?\n* Or that you did notice it, why didn't you change your password immediately? Why didn't you report this immediately as soon as you noticed something wasn't right when you started seeing emails notifying you about actions that you didn't do?\n* If the email was a dummy account that you barely ever use, do you suppose that's Riot's problem? The point of tying an account to an email is just so that if there's something wrong, you'd realise very quickly.\n* Do you also suppose having a password so weak it can be easily brute-forced is Riot's problem? I mean I used a password consisted of 4 lower case letters and 4 numbers, which is pretty damn weak, for 4-5 years without even once getting hacked (I changed it to a much securer one some time ago), so how weak was your password?\n* Also, who the hell puts RP into someone else's account anyway? Who does that? Especially when they're also scripting?\n* You also said that \"i have emails people putting riot points from other countires onto my account\". How do you know it was from another country from your email? Because I don't believe RP purchase receipts show which country the transaction was made from, as it only shows the date and payment method/instrument?\n* Were you really hacked?\n\nEDIT: I suppose since the a Rioter has updated that OP seems to have really hacked, and unbanned the account. I guess I'll drop my case. Though personally, I am rather iffy about the legitimacy of OP's claims, but I digress.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2017-01-31T06:00:09.213+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In this case, yea I believe he was hacked.
