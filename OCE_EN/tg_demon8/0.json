Whether you are a serious gamer looking to take commitment to the next level or just a casual player who is looking for a team to play with and improve with, we can help.\r\nTactical Gaming is quite a structured gaming community compared to most and this is regulated by the ongoing efforts of the Squad Leaders, their main duty is to post updates and schedule &#039;Practices&#039;. Currently the mandatory practice days for OCE are Sunday and Wednesday, both from 7pm to 9 pm. There is also optional practices in between.\r\n\r\nLooking for new members ANY rank and ANY role.\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re interested feel free to add me on discord and i can help and assist you through the registration process and test phase or even if you are wanting to acquire more information regarding the community.\r\n\r\nDiscord - TG Demon8#2634\r\n\r\nSee you on the Rift Summoners!","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-02-06T18:59:02.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wrong server","replies":[]}]}
