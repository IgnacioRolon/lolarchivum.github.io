Feedback from a longtime player)","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You&#039;ll read this and probably check my game history and be like; just cause you&#039;re on a losing spree, learn to adapt, or some other bollocks... but honestly I&#039;ve had this feeling since season 3. Reading the changes in league, the future of it and the hopes of the next season has kinda left me, again, disappointed. So much so that I actually have decided to quit - **FULLY**. I know the feeling isn&#039;t within all of us but I just wanted to at least say somewhere that I have enjoyed my time playing league solo and with friends, but now I just feel like Riot has moved the game into a place where I will never go.\r\n\r\nThe leaverbuster system, thank god there is one, but being put into a 20 minute wait (6 times might I add) for 5 games simply because of some other companies poor quality of service is... a little crap. I know it has improved quality overall, but it&#039;s kinda turned into an issue for me and a deterrent of your game.\r\n\r\nThings have been severely unbalanced for ages, it was either pick these champions, masteries and runes or be at a disadvantage (like as of preseason; pick Thunderlord&#039;s Decree on everything or be at a disadvantage). It&#039;s an extra aspect that you add to a MOBA that sets it a part from every other MOBA, and you&#039;ve been trying to make it more unique and individualistic to each champion and role. Almost 6 years in, and you still can&#039;t seem to balance out changes within masteries or champions. I actually found the later months of beta more balanced than the current state of league though, mastery and champion wise - it felt more for the player when you made changes back then, but now it feels like you&#039;re a business trying to create something new and appealing for newer players (too bad for the newer guys who don&#039;t follow meta/lane roles and getting a heavy beating from older ones because of it).\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been playing a lot of Smite recently, and I actually have enjoyed the game more; I feel like you need to be good at the game to set yourself apart - on the individual level and team level. Watching the pro scene develop, it&#039;s becoming more and more bland, I don&#039;t see the next season being anymore exciting. Individual mismatches can be made up by having a good team (solo q issue), and my most loved midlaner xPeke made it to top 4 in worlds, even when i thought he wasn&#039;t as good as any other midlaner in the EU LCS. You look at Smite or DOTA 2 or any other MOBA, you abuse one person in a team, the team falters. It&#039;s what I loved about team games, but with the recent changes and how I see your plans for league, I feel like I&#039;m not going to enjoy the game. Of course there needs to be some room to pick up the wait of a faltering team-mate, but just pick Ori or some other stupidly safe champion, keep him safe and wombo with malphite and you&#039;re good, doesnt matter if his weak mechanics get abused.\r\n\r\nMust be the GhostCrawler effect, he made WoW bad for me, now League is becoming for me. Dissect what I&#039;ve said if  you guys want, I ain&#039;t reading it cause this is my last ever association with league - I&#039;m not sad or happy that I&#039;m leaving, I just don&#039;t find this fun anymore. My opinion, ain&#039;t changing, good bye League community and good bye Riot. It&#039;s been fun, but you&#039;ve slowly made the fun less and less over the years.","replies":[{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2015-12-09T16:05:34.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok {{champion:33}}","replies":[]}]}
