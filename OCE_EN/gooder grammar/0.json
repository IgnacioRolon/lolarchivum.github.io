Fizz and Riven had laid out on the hills of the rift all night and watched the stars. They had fallen asleep not long after midnight. &ldquo;How did you sleep my lovely maiden&rdquo; Fizz said as his voice left a warm spot on her neck. &ldquo;Amazingly well in your arms my handsome prince&rdquo; Riven blushed.\r\n&ldquo;Shall I treat you to breakfast?&rdquo;\r\nRiven nodded happily. &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Then I will take you to the finest of diners&rdquo; Fizz said as he jumped up like Zac.\r\nRiven became love struck at the sight. &ldquo;Oh Fizz&rdquo; she said with rosy cheeks. Fizz lifted her up bridal style and spun her around in circles. He set her down with such grace.\r\n At the diner Riven wanted to sit by the window, but Fizz wanted to sit in the back by the jukebox. They started intensely at each other. Noxians stared, Damacians stared, everyone was watching them with confusion, and one champion was even sexually aroused by the staring, it was Taric. Fizz finally caved in and sat with Riven by the window. \r\n &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t resist the beautiful frustration.&rdquo; Fizz said reaching across the table to hold her warm hand. Riven blushed and held his wet scaly hand as well. The waiter finally came over to take their order. Riven looked up at the man and realized who this man was&hellip;\r\nAnnie.\r\n&ldquo;Daughter&hellip;?&rdquo; Riven asked. Fizz just looked at Riven then Annie. &ldquo;What are you talking about my dear? This is just a waiter&rdquo; Fizz asked. &ldquo;M-Mother?&rdquo; Annie&rsquo;s hands trembled. &ldquo;What are you doing here?! You left father so long ago to be with&hellip;&rdquo; Annie&rsquo;s head turned slightly. &ldquo;For you.&rdquo; She said looking at Fizz with such a disgusted face. &ldquo;F-For me?&rdquo; Fizz&rsquo;s face lit up. &ldquo;Riven?! I NEVER KNEW YOU LOVED ME SO MUCH TO LEAVE SOMEONE!&rdquo; He stood up and hugged Riven from across the table. &ldquo;Fizz. Please get off my food my prince&rdquo; Riven mumbled patting Fizz&rsquo;s back.","replies":[{"poster":"HierosGodhead","date":"2016-06-26T04:05:22.851+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to buy the eyes that didn't read this.","replies":[{"poster":"Gooder Grammar","date":"2016-06-28T03:34:29.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is that good or bad :^)?","replies":[]}]}]}
