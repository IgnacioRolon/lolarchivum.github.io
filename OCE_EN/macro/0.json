Its completely useless now as the new client has been retired. (this comes up when i type league of legends in the start menu search win8.1 and is the only result).

You should find an Application file called \"LeagueClient\" which is what you should be using instead of the old \"lol.launcher\".\n\nRight click the \"league client\" app and create a shortcut on your desktop. voila.\n\nAnother thing is LoL itself is only about 5gb big however everey time it patches it keeps everything and the redundant files so many peoples LoL folders are well over 15-20gb. So sometimes deleting the entire Riot Games folder and downloading a fresh copy can save you a tonne of space.","replies":[]}]}
