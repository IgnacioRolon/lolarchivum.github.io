These tips got me from low bronze to high bronze in a week. \r\n1. Do not EVER play on tilt. Your brain processes thinks differently in different states, when you are \"tilted\" your brain can't process as fast concluding in poor choices.\r\n2. Don't play with the meta. Don't look at a champion who is currently in the meta and play/main them, chances are that you're going to get camped to keep you down under control.\r\n3. Avoid duo (unless you have good synergy + voice Comms). I recently duod a lot with one person, we did Skype sometimes although I found that my performance declined as we played more and more. This certain person gave up easily and I took habbit of this. I stoped played and started climbing.\r\n4. Find someone you actually enjoy playing. Find a champ that appeals you and doesn't get boring or repetitive after 10 or 15 games.\r\n5. Don't watch LCS, OPL, Worlds or any other competition to learn. Watch something lower like plat-diamond.\r\nMy next tip works well with me but  unsure if it will for you. So after I play a champ for around 20 games I get bored of that champ and my performance turns to shit, so when you get bored of that champ try someone knew out and experiment.","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2017-02-21T00:26:37.632+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Umm.\nI got out of Bronze. After three years. (Yes I'm shit, but I'm Silver 4 now)\nI agree with some stuff that you've pointed out like don't duo, or play on tilt.\n\nBut to address critical shit:\n1. Don't play a champ that is too technical (Lee Sin, Zed, Yasuo) cause like they're usually aimed down pretty quickly in bronze.\n2. Don't play champs that are OP asf, in bronze that means:\n* Zed\n*Yasuo\n*Fiora\n*Etc\nCause again, we bronzies think you're gonna fucking destroy us, so you'll be aimed hard.\n3. (TO JUNGLERS) Don't gank a lane that is 0/2, I mean yes you're suppose to help out, but holy shit, 0/2 top lane, the enemy laner thinks he's fucking Faker and will most likely get a double at top cause your top laner is stupid and doesn't know how to play safe, or you just went too fucking deep, like tower diving deep. Invade jungle, gank other lanes. The reasonable time to gank top (if we're still going along the lines of this story), is around probably 8 - 15 minutes, any later then you'd fucked up, not top lane, but you, cause *YOU* (the jungle) is always blamed.\n4. (TO ADC'S) Please, just, please, use common sense, if you know you're gonna get fucked, just tower hug, and if your supp is going to go in, check your HP, and the supp's HP before going in, also check out the items that the enemy ADC has, cause if lethality is up, then you're going to go down.\n5. (TO MID LANERS) You're not fucking Faker, you're not going to go on Random LoL moments, you're Bronze, for a reason, so stop trying to do the outplays and shit, but make sure you actually know what you're doing, if this doesn't apply to you, then figure out the combos and shit.\n6. (TO SUPP) Stop, going, in, on, adc, low, health, please....\n7. (TO TOP) BUILD FUCKING TANK, unless you're a ad scaling champ (Graves, Quinn), then just build some tank items please: {{item:3053}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3742}} \n\n8. TLDR (Too long didn't read) - If you're bronze, play to your strengths, and learn a champ for each lane as you will get filled mostly for support.\n9. No salt, if you're playing on tilt, go onto a normal, if you're on a losing streak, play a norm with friends (2 games at least).\n\nSOZ FOR THE LONG FUCKING POST\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-02-21T04:00:04.300+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"half reason i dont climb is retarded allies, other half is op champs like fiora and darius, yas and zed are fine in my books, albeit annoying","replies":[{"poster":"macro","date":"2017-02-21T07:37:32.941+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And that's the mentality that's keeping you in the shithole.

People tell me my playing skills are in low platinum, and I agree with them, the only problem is, most silver players act like bronze players (trolling,no listening to sot calling, etc.). Another thing that people point out on how to get outta bronze is to farm better and don't over stay, and I agree with that remark for good reason, champions that are very easy to farm with are the kinda champions I play more offten then not, like caitlyn, lucian, yasuo, and more. This also did help me get outta bronze hell elo. Now their is another way to gte help with getting outta bronze, and thats by playing champions that are made to baby you, like vladiamir, or caitlyn, or how about even blitzcrank.

I acknowledge that with my setup developing mechanical skill isn't really an option, so I try to make good decisions and play simple champions.\n\nTbh I think I'd probably be bronze 5 if I actually had a good setup, because my setup forces me to focus on things like minion mechanics, warding, remembering cooldowns, making the right calls and watching the map for opportunities. I can't play an outplay based champion or skillcap champion, so I've gotten better at things that I think matter more at this level. \n\nPersonally I think you learn alot playing on high ping and low fps.","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2017-02-26T15:52:03.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I started playing in Season 2 when we HAD to play on NA. Mind you, I didn't even have good net at the time so my ping was usually ~240ms. I justified this as being okay because NA was the OCE region's designated server at the time so Riot couldn't really get mad at use for lagging. During this time I pretty much only played in the middle of the day when I wasn't at uni and while my siblings were at school so that I had plenty of bandwidth.\n\nMy laptop was decent at the time, but when my framerate started to drop I quit until I could afford a better computer.\n\nThis is why I think you shouldn't be allowed to play LoL. I'm a responsible person. I saw I was a burden to my teammates, so I took measures to correct that. To see people like you all over the place ruining games makes me wish there was a system scan in place to prevent people from playing Ranked.\n\nIt's an issue because Riot doesn't think it's an issue. So someone ruins a game, then someone else ruins a game.

Like maybe pinging that their jungler may be bot if you see that your bot lane pushed up and there are no wards.\n\n2) Play your comfort pick: Don't only play OP champs that you see on youtube or whatever, play the champs that u enjoy and are good at. But pls don't play something like AP smite blitz mid...\n\n3) Spend time watching REPLAY ANALYSIS by pros on youtube: These babies show you in detail the laning phases and the positionings/ pathings that you should be taking in certain situations.

This is because if you think of ranked as a way of improvement you will be constantly trying to find areas where you could have done better, but if you are focusing on the \"winning\" mindset, you will be constantly trying to find excuses as to why you lost. When you improve, you will climb naturally.
