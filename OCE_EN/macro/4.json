And then to gain stronger runes/Quintessences you would &quot;forge&quot; several of the same runes together making a stronger rune.\r\n\r\nAnd 1 last thing..... What about all my IP? Are we going to be reimbursed?\r\n\r\nIf anyone have any thoughts or other ideas leave a comment below!","replies":[{"poster":"Vegathron","date":"2016-10-16T21:48:53.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think in a competitive role based game like this you cant have direct incentives that effect how you play too much. having this motivation to get x stat may deviate you from what you would normally do and ruin the experience for others. eg \"well im going full ap support with no support item now cuz i need this ap rune\" etc. this is also likely the reason there are no acheivements for characters (as cool as it would be) eg get a pentakill on jinx and unlock x skin.","replies":[{"poster":"macro","date":"2016-10-19T05:05:48.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is a true point but to counter that they could have it like 200AP, you get me?
