The game had just started and we all loaded in. I saw a big white box on assassin{{champion:11}} &#039;s sword. I leashed him and as he q&#039;d my screen flashed white. As the game continued, with come particles like {{champion:4}}   wildcard and ultimate eye, towers getting destroyed and many other things my screen continued to have white moving boxes and the screen constantly flashing on what seemed like when someone used a summoner spell. At the start of the game, i ended up going 3/7 because of this bug and the fact that it was annoying me that much (i did end up getting a quadrakill and saving the game gladly and won my promos!!) I unfortunately forgot to screenshot it but i did find a picture, similar to my situation (http://imgur.com/HRB8Kyy.jpg)\r\n\r\nCan someone give me some insight on what happened during that game? Has anyone else experienced this bug? Much appreciated guys, See you on the rift summoners!","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2017-02-10T10:46:02.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah thats not a bug, someone at Riot just really hates epileptics.","replies":[{"poster":"macro","date":"2017-02-13T11:08:10.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i don't understand how i won that game either xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-02-09T16:06:39.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like missing textures to me, sometimes happens if the patch doesn't apply properly.
