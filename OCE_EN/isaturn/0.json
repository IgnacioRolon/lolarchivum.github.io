I&#039;m the scape goat. so what happens in post game? &quot;report pantheon&quot; so i get reported for &quot;verbal abuse&quot; despite me literally saying NOTHING toxic. i smiled and said i wont gank a losing lane without wards. But because everyone is angry with ME for our 2/15 lucian, *I* get reported and *I* get the warning about being toxic despite literally being told to kill myself, to neck myself, to go &quot;be with the dodos&quot;? and to take my ebola elsewhere.\r\nI&#039;m not gonna lie. I&#039;m pretty fucking pissed off. Justice in this game is a majority rules decision and whoever ends up being the scape goat bears the brunt of it.\r\nDoes anyone actually look at what was said in chat or does riot just take the report&#039;s word for it?","replies":[{"poster":"cookiemuncher","date":"2015-12-27T16:29:28.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nami summed it up quite well. I'd like to add one more thing I find helpful atleast for me. If you have a game such as that don't end there. Rather play one more game, or more games untill you get a good game (win or lose doesn't matter) where you feel content with the game. It will get your mind off the bad experience and leave you in a better mood both in and out of the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-12-27T04:49:18.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Verbal abuse reports result in your chat logs getting scanned by the system. If the reports are false then they won't hurt you.\n\nThat message that pops up is *only* there to let you know you've been getting an increase in reports recently, and does not necessarily mean you might get punished (the system has not yet verified the reports). If you weren't toxic then you have nothing to worry about, and those people will even lose weight in their future reports.\n\nAlso good to note is that asking people to report is considered harassment and is a reportable offense itself. Whether the report would be valid or false, they need to let people decide for themselves what they wish to report for one, and also it only takes 1 report for the system to flag a match to be checked (even 8 more won't make the system check any harder).","replies":[]}]}
