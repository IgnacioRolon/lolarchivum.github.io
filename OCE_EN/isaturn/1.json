I&#039;ve been playing a lot of rek&#039;sai lately and the two lane/game losing issues I encounter are:\r\n\r\nWhen burrowed, if silenced or stunned, rek&#039;sai will be unable to unburrow, and even sometimes unable to move even once the CC has worn off. The worst examples are when Garen&#039;s Q silences me, or a riven or jax stun (i play a lot of rek top), so for instance i might spam click to attack him which would unburrow me once the silence wore off right? Wrong, instead Rek&#039;sai refuses to unburrow, and even worse, wont move at all for another 2 or so seconds, basically giving a bunch for free harrass for them, and losing me any hope of a trade back.\r\n\r\nThe second issue is in relation to the tunnels. If you place Tunnel A &gt; B ending where tunnel C&gt;D starts, and try to use them fluidly/ in rapid succession to gap close or escape a large distance, upon exiting point B and trying to enter point C, tunnel C&gt;D will close up without rek&#039;sai travelling through it. Effectively killing the awesome escapes I had set up minutes in advance.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not sure if anyone else has noticed this, but i hope this reaches a place where it might be looked at.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nSaturn","replies":[{"poster":"Towerlock","date":"2015-11-15T06:48:38.970+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just logged in to bump this thread.
