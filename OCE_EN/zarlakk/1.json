Seeing a player on my team with a level 4 or 5 mastery icon, always has me feeling reassured especially in those Solo Queue load screens. However, I cant help to wonder why it stops at 5? If I&#039;m to understand correctly you can not progress past the 5th tier of a champions mastery as of yet. Now, If you are anything like me you&#039;ve been level 30 in League of Legends since sometime around 2011/12, and this is the first taste for leveling that you have had for a very very long time. For some of you I suppose you aren&#039;t a big fan of leveling, but I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not alone in saying that I thought it was great. However, I believe much like our summoner levels, we should be able to proceed ranking up until Champion Mastery level 30, rewards or no rewards, I think it would be a neat way to incorporate a way to give Summoners something to strive for.\r\n\r\nRiot Staff mention in the FAQ of the Champion Mastery page that &quot;[Skins] are not something we&rsquo;re considering right now, but we are exploring other ideas for unique rewards we think you guys might like.&quot;. Which I guess is the topic that I&#039;m ever so slowly nudging this post towards, that and many other wards. So I&#039;ll leave a few of my ideas below, and see what you think about it all:\r\n\r\n**Mastery Tier 10:** Unique Champion Icon Unlocked - Unlocks the ability to purchase a unique Icon for your mastered champion, perhaps with some fancy border of some sort, nothing  too special as a mastery level of 10 will be quite achievable after a reasonable amount of hours. A very low ip charge if any at all, something like 500ip would be suitable I believe \r\n\r\n**Mastery Tier 15:** Unique Tuant, Dance, Laugh, Catch Phrase or Recall animation - To some Summoners this may not seem all that rewarding, but to others who have a tendency to spam their laughs and taunts (Targeting specifically those Nunu bots and Singed trolls) every-time the enemy blitz-crank misses a pull. I believe adding some uniqueness to their characters as a reward for their time spent on them would be a suitable reward. (Well aware that this would take a lot of work on behalf of Riot, but would be very cool to see in game)\r\n\r\n**Mastery Tier 20:** Unique Statue Ward Skin: - Given the trinkets that have been introduced into this game, I believe that a ward skin would be appropriate, and they would definitely not go unseen considering the map is much more lit up with wards then it use to be (based on my personal experience that is). Being able to place a bunch of miniature Chogath statues around the map to show the world that I have played him long enough to achieve this level 20 rating would feel pretty damn awesome.\r\n\r\n**Mastery Tier 25:**  *comes to the realization that he didn&#039;t quite have as many ideas as he thought*\r\n\r\n**Mastery Tier 30:** The Summoners Master Skin - Unlocks the ability to purchase a unique master skin from the store. I&#039;m sure this thought has crossed everyone&#039;s minds at some point. But having some sort of ultimate skin, that can only be gained through leveling your mastery score would be fantastic. No RP Purchase, however still having to buy the skin with IP I believe would be reasonable, or not. Plus I believe implementing this would set off a pretty mad rush to see who can be the first in the rift to be walking around with their mastery skins\r\n\r\nAnother idea which I believe would be cool to have in a system like this, is a chart where you can see all the ranks (S,A,B,C,D) you&#039;ve earned, and you can see how you perform on average. Plus the bragging rights over friends would be magnificent, I could finally prove to them that a scrub like me is capable of getting an S+. \r\n\r\nMass apologizes to all, if this is in the wrong spot or somebody else has already posted. Just thought it would be chill to word vomit onto the page and let you guys have a piece of what was going thru my brain today while waiting in queue, feel free to reject the shiz outta all this, ill respond as often as I can. But for now, I gotta go get promoted \r\n\r\n~~Zarlakk","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-19T01:19:45.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"should have put it in GD\n\nand they already plan to up the mastery max level, and are adding rewards which give you the chance to win free skins if you have completely mastered the champ","replies":[{"poster":"Zarlakk","date":"2015-11-19T01:22:11.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers, can I change that?
