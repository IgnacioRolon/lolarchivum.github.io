Something different than just ARAM, Conquest and TT, which are all basically the same thing.\n\nRito needs to give OCE some more map modes on a permanent basis, not only will this hopefully get more players to play, but I know I will play more due to the choices that are there.\n\nFor us in OCE all we can do during the week is Conquest or ARAM, and only one of those gives you something other than a laugh, eventually everyone gets bored when it is just the same thing every time you play, we need a variety or players will start walking.","replies":[]}]}
