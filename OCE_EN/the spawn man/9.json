I had initially replied with my picks of Sion, Morgana and Lux, but mentioned that in my opinion, Bard has one of the best CC kits in the game in the true sense of CC. Autos that slow, Q that slows/stuns and his ultimate, a long range, AoE stasis that cannot be escaped, reduced, cleansed etc. Of course it&#039;s harder to use than others, but hey, we&#039;re not arguing skill here. I can hardly think of CC with longer range, where the opponents can do as little once it hits them, with such a large AoE and such versatility.\n\nThe user replied with that Bard&#039;s ultimate is the worst in the game, is terrible and that I am a moron more or less. All because the ultimate can affect allies and stops the enemy taking damage while under stasis. If anything to me, that just ups the versatility of his Ultimate.\n\nI&#039;ve made a counter point that because of it&#039;s long range, you can use it to ambush stray enemies, allowing for your team to get set up around them (which is almost as good as dead), but no matter what point I make, he is set against what I feel is the best CC in the game, in terms of true meaning of the phrase &#039;Crowd Control&#039;.\n\nAm I deluded, and is Bard&#039;s ultimate really the worst CC in the game like the user says? Or is he sniffing a bit too much moonshine? Thoughts appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2015-09-26T02:17:40.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Worst ult in the game has to go to Karma. Bard is awesome. Just saw one that threw his ult on a Cailtlyn who was ulting one of his teammates and they would have died were it not for Bard <3.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-09-26T01:08:27.606+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i hate that term \"\"one of\" the best\" it really doesnt mean anything except that whatever you're referring to is actually just really good. i hate it even more when referring to bard as having \"one of the best\" cc kits in the game. in terms of having any cc at all he is one of the worst. i would honestly rather have akalis W for his Q. i see as much bards just Q'ing randomly instead of going for a stun as much as vaynes condemn not being used to stun either. bard is a troll pick, anyone who disagrees just likes playing bard. his kit is literally the most bamboozling, uncoordinated, mismatched, non-cohesive one ive seen for any 4800IP+ champ (any champ released in like 2 years minimum) obviously any champ is good when playing to their strengths and bard does have a lot of potential for quality plays though.\n\nhis \"cc kit\".....is not \"one of the best\"....best cc kit is defs nautilus and then only maokai comes close. everyone else whos cc is noteworthy is either mainly for zoning instead of damaging, like anivia or its their entire champs gimmick like blitz's hook \n\nid say lucians ultimate, as a true \"ultimate\" is the worst. overall its a lot easier and it'll probably be more effective 3 times before a decent bard ult in most games, but taking into account its potential its a lot better.","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-09-26T01:56:42.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See this is where I ran into trouble with the other user, they confuse seen skill/usage of Bard with his potential. Maybe I'm talking about on paper. Obviously Bard is a hard champ to play properly, and maybe most of the time, an unskilled kiddie isn't going to be able to pull it off. But I'm talking about how on paper, his ultimate cannot be escaped, the range, the AoE, etc etc. Compared to other CC, it's pretty good compared to other CC which can be cleansed, escaped and reduced - none of which apply to Bard's stasis. If you're basing your opinion solely on how you've seen bronzies play it, I'd think that same way too.\n\nThat aside, I honestly don't think Bard is a troll pick. I don't pick him with every ADC (I main support) but when I do play him, it's certainly not because I want to screw the game over. Yes he is a troll-some champion with his kit, but I don't think you're forced to play him that way. His Q is great for stunning and getting your adc out of a jam. Your W is amazing for setting up health for your mid laner, jungler and then for yourself and your adc to get a great laning phase in (I actually put four points into W before anything else). His E is amazing for setting up ganks or baits. And I've already talked about his Ult. Plus his autos are slows and wave clear. His roaming nature means you always have good vision, and can almost be a second ganker if your jungler needs to get a sated devourer and cant always support mid.\n\nAs for worst ult in the game, well, I certainly don't think Lucian's is the worst by a country mile. Just because people don't know how to use it, doesn't make it bad. I've seen plenty of Lucian triple kills from a perfect ult. If I had to pick an actual worst ult, it'd be Singed's. You gain stats. Wow. Yeah it's a lot of stats, but you're already tanky and speedy enough, it doesn't initiate, it doesn't deal damage. Heck, even Urgot's can initiate. That'd be my pick for worst Ult in the game. But you can't 'miss' or be 'bad' with it, so I'm guessing you don't like it lol? :P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-09-25T23:48:51.002+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Best CC kit in the game is Nautilus hands down","replies":[{"poster":"DamnationsHound","date":"2015-09-26T00:48:32.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do agree","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-25T18:08:29.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:32}} q and ult","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-09-26T01:44:08.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I picked up Amumu recently and he is so much fun.

It may seem nice on paper but most team fights have people you don't want to be involved with, (tanks) and people you want to CC so you can attack them (carries), and the radius of bard's ult usually forces you to choose between \n\nputting their whole team under stasis and therefore losing the ability to dive carries, \nputting both tank frontline a under stasis thus risking your own carries, \nulting their carries to kill the tanks first, ulting your own team to waste specific abilities, or \nputting your carries under stasis to let the tanks go in first. \n\nNone of these situations are optimal. When most people say CC, single stuns count but Zhonya's usually doesn't so that goes against Bard (who's ult is balanced in the fact that each individual situation can be done better with another ult but at the same time it's so flexible). \n\nSecondly, don't you even try to touch on the subject of who insulted who, saying \"Lol, don't you know that *insert subject the original poster was posting about* means *insert semantics*?\" As a response to \"you can't *insert expected result* tho\" is the most jerk move you can make on any conversation with the exclusion of physical violence.\n\nAnd finally, both of our comments have been randomly down voted but I'll tell you now that I didn't downvote this one and other unrelated. I'm not sure if someone else has down voted me but its best that I say it here.","replies":[]}]}
