Or nerf them. You changed my last main, Ryze, and I adapted. You changed the HUD. I adapted. You even made that ward option in champ select which crashed my launcher. I ADAPTED!\r\n\r\nBut this time, you have gone too far Riot. Please, PLEASE, restore the 10 minute timer on Teemo&#039;s mushrooms! I know I&#039;m going to get hate for this, but it has absolutely ruined Teemo for me.\r\n\r\nI know the little Satan gets little love, but whenever I looked at the map and saw fields of glorious mushrooms (many species of which are now endangered - have you thought of the environmental impact Riot?!), it brought a tear to my eye. Forget diving into team fights, blinding the enemy and shredding. NO! My one solace in life was fostering my mushies, and leading the enemy on a merry chase. THAT is what made Teemo the troll king. Oh the joy when that 50hp Ashe thought she was going into the bush to recall&hellip; and instead got a face full of poison death. Such joy Riot. Now there is only pain.\r\n\r\nYou plant a mushie. You barely have time to farm a couple of waves and recall before the mushie is gone. No more weaving pathways of escape. At best you will have time to set up a few to aid prior to a team fight, but otherwise, there&#039;s little incentive for placing them other than in the most frequented areas, as the chances they&#039;ll feel the tender press of innocent feet is next to none before they disappear! I don&#039;t care if they bounce! If I wanted bouncing explosions, I&#039;d play Ziggs!\r\n\r\nSo if Teemo is no longer the champ who can set up a trap, and lure/wait for enemies to come, then he has just become another boring duellist. I don&#039;t care if you nerf the camoflage, and the bouncing, heck, even give me a big giant target over my head! All I want is my mushies to last longer than it takes you to read this post! I&#039;d be happy even with a half-way compromise. 7 minutes is better than 5 minutes Riot.\r\n\r\nIf getting Teemo to be more widely accepted as a pick means trading short term burst for long term planning/trapping/fun, then I fear the true spirit of Teemo is gone.\r\n\r\nPlease Riot. Bring back the fun (well fun for all those not stepping on mushrooms). :(","replies":[{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-08-08T02:16:03.143+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot needs to embrace the satan, only then can they provide a true rework for the almighty teeto.","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-08-08T14:55:19.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes!

Okay, so he doesn't get revealed if he moves around inside a bush? Bushes aren't that big, and if your opponent knows you're in there and is trying to hit you, it's most likely with an AoE attack, so you're screwed. If he *doesn't* know you're in there, then what possible advantage would moving left and right a tiny bit without being seen do? You're going to come out of camo and attack either way to surprise him. The advantages of this tweak are miniscule.\n\nSure yes, his AS have gone up with ranks from camo, but on the whole, if I could have that or longer lasting mushies, I'd take the latter. Again, he's turned into a boring duellist.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2015-08-09T11:07:57.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"personally i dont care tbh as i dont play teemo that much unless i roll on aram..\n\n ive been there though.. the first time they nerfed mordekaiser... i played him twice.. thought wtf , never played him again and eventually quit for a few years.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Truegolddigger","date":"2015-08-09T12:05:33.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Umm...
