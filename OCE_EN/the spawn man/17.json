I played a game today and afterwards went to check the stats and everything in Launcher. The game wasn&#039;t there. No biggie, I&#039;ve had games taken a while to show up in my Match History before. They usually pop up after I play another game.\r\n\r\nI play another game, and the second game I played shows in my Match History, but not the first game. Hmmm, strange. Oh well, maybe the game just didn&#039;t count. An error?\r\n\r\nSo I play a third game, and now that game doesn&#039;t appear in my Match History either. I&#039;ve checked on the website, and it mirrors my Launcher match history, showing only game 2, not game 1 and 3.\r\n\r\nSo, questions. Is this a known bug? Why does it happen? Did the matches I played count (they seem to have added to my Mastery and IP) and are just not showing, or have they disappeared into the ether? Any answer would be great! :D","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-09-21T20:59:20.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, uhâ€¦ it just did it again. It's seriously only counting like every second game. Just played a super game as Karthus and then go to check my Match History and it's not there. Sad face.\n\nBump.","replies":[{"poster":"ValkyireInjector","date":"2015-09-22T15:20:49.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's happened before. All i remember is if you or someone else gets DDOs the game isn't recorded. However this happened to me casually and yeah it just wasn't recorded in my history.","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-09-23T00:52:20.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was a mini-update when I played my Launcher and then when I looked at my match history just now the games all appeared and haven't had the problem since. Hopefully that means they fixed it. I do wish they'd reply on these forums though. No wonder the OCE forums went dead...","replies":[]}]}]}]}
