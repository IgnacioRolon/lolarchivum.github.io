It&#039;s just kind of amusing to me when Riot has been pushing the &quot;We want to make every game feel unique!&quot; envelope recently. Obviously they can&#039;t control what champions people pick, but it&#039;s kind of amusing when you see mirror match ups almost every other game.\r\n\r\nFor mids, I think I see either Yas, Zed or Ahri every game. For tops, it&#039;s Riven, Tryn or Darius. For ADC, it&#039;s pretty much Vayne or Trist at the moment, with a tiny bit of Jinx or Miss Fortune thrown in. Jungle is almost always Lee Sin it seems, with Master Yi or Xin a close second. And for support it seems to be Blitz, Thresh, Sona or Soraka.\r\n\r\nAnd that&#039;s it. The number of times I&#039;ve seen Trist/Blitz vs Trist/Blitz is unbelievable. I think one game I played, we nearly had a mirror match up of Riven, Yas, Lee, Vayne and Blitz. It&#039;s just ridiculous. Tell me I&#039;m not going crazy. Can anyone recall the last time they played verse a Yorick or Urgot or Taric? What about played a game that didn&#039;t include one of the champions above, or even a game where one of the adcs wasn&#039;t Trist or Vayne?\r\n\r\nCan Riot fix this? How would they even begin? Why does it happen? Are some champions too over-powered? Or others too under-powered? Are some champions considered &#039;top tier&#039;?\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-12-06T23:23:00.043+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey man,\n\nI'm definitely not an expert here but I just wanted to throw in my opinion. All my numbers and facts are from [champion.gg ( statistics)](http://champion.gg/statistics/#). I viewed each role and sorted by \"Play Percent\"\n\nTop lane - I would say is in a good spot, the variance of \"play percent\" in the top 10 isn't that large. This got better since juggernauts patched.\nMiddle - Same as top not too bad I think this got a lot better with the AP item revamp we did a while ago\nSupport - Same as above...except for Thresh. Thresh is definitely a new age support with a lot of tools and interesting mechanics.\nADC - Vayne, Lucian, Trist are all 20+% pick percentage. \nJungle - Aside from Lee Sin, most other junglers are relatively close.\n\nPlay rate is an interesting thing. It's only natural that some champions are played more than others. Players choose champions they like based on a variety of reasons.\n\n* Champion theme ( ninja, samurai, viking, mage, etc)\n* Mechanics (abilities, how it feels to play as the champion, how fun are they to play?)\n* Role ( tank, support, assassin etc)\n* Lore\n* Perceived strength\n\nI actually think the top two reasons are champion theme and mechanics followed by perceived strength. I am going to talk about Lee, Vayne and Thresh here specifically because those are what stood out for me in the champion.gg statistics table.\n\nLee Sin and Vayne - Once again, only my opinion. I think these champions are played lots because their mechanics are damn fun. When I watch great vayne or leesin plays make plays I always say to myself \"god damn that was sick, incoming Lee/Vayne main\". Lee's mechanics are super interesting (lots of dashes and angles with ward jumps and Q) and Vayne's mechanics makes her super fun popping in and out of invis while dishing out tonnes of damage.\n\nThresh like I said above is a new age support with a lot of tools and interesting mechanics. Latern, flay and hook all offer very interesting game interactions.\n\nTrist - I think this patch her play rate is a bit higher than it would be naturally due to the epic dragon trainer legendary skin coming out.\n\nSo the question can Riot fix this?\nI think we can, but the only way to do this is to make sweeping changes to a whole role in combination with updating older champion mechanics.\n\nE.g. Juggernauts change, AP items revamp, ADC revamp all helped bring in more variation in champions.\n\nThere is still work to be done but its going to take time, first we add the final touches to Marksmen rework throughout the preseason then we move onto the next group of champions.\n\nIf you're super interested in game design discussion head on over to the Dev Corner on the side bar or check out http://ask.fm/RiotGhostcrawler (Ghostcrawler is our design director).","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-12-07T10:18:47.629+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't want this post to sound like a complaint and its not, more so a cry of encouragement, but the constant presence of a select few champs in EVERY game is getting really frustrating.\n\nWhile obviously some champs are always going to be played more than others, there should never be gaps this big between champs; for example vayne has a 33+% pick rate (and has been for the better part of a year, regardless of marksman changes) and kog'maw is only 2.6% even after his wild new update. \n\nthat is just screaming out that something is wrong, and to be blunt, you are blind if you cant see it, and not being critical but the marksman changes have done nothing to aid that (except just adding lucian to the Vayne/Jinx/Trist 'dominating everyone else' group) infact the marksman/items changes have affected Yas/Trynd etc more than that ADC's that they were intended for.\n\nwhile its fine that vayne is played more than kog, there should never be a 31% difference between any champs of the same role, that is a clear indicator that something isn't right, and unless riot is willing to publicly state that some champs are just straight up 'better' than others, then having such wildly different pick rates is a clear statement that there is an imbalance in the force. \n\nno-one wants to vs a vayne or lee in one third of ALL games, even if he/she was your favourite champ you would get sick of that, hell thats why i stopped playing yasuo.\n\nyou say that the factors of champ selection are:\nchampion theme\nmechanics \nrole\nlore\nperceived strength \n\nso therefore something needs to be changed to bring, say, vayne's pick rate down\nso your choices are:\n\nnerf her (percieved strength)\nchange her abilities (mechanics)\nchanger her lore (lore)\nadjust her role (role)\nChange her theme (champion theme)\n\nso being blunt about it; Just do it! it is a problem and it wont just go away on its own. \n\npick one of the above options, and just do it..\n\nnow being realistic, changing her lore to make her LESS popular, is not really an option and will only infuriate vayne players, and lets be brutally honest, it'd be pretty hard to make her lore worse...\nHer theme could be changed, i bet not even half of her players know what she is anyway, but i cant see any change in that reducing her popularity.\nHer role could be changed, obviously there would be outrage if she was no longer an ADC, but you could at least take away the 'assassin' part of her role, its kind of silly anyway, having an ADC thats also an assassin, thats like having a fire pokemon thats also water type. \nher mechanics could be changed, but really what would you change them to? she will always centre around her silver bolts and manoverability no matter what changes occur around them, and if she still relies on them then her mechanics haven't really changed at all.\nso really the only viable option is to reduce her perceived strength, give her a nerf, and not a -3 AD nerf, a proper reduced move speed/true damage, nerf.\n\nAdjusting AD items and other ADC's and everything around her, is only skirting the problem, she needs a direct hit herself. \n\nand Vayne is just my example, i don't have a vendetta against her or anything, the same thing can be said for her can be said for Lee-sin, Thresh, Zed etc. (although Zed/Thresh have stronger lore's) \n\nalso you include 'Lore' as one of the reasons that people play champs, while this has been known to happen (and is one of the main reasons i personally play champs) \nthe numbers speak for themselves, Azir and Gangplank have arguably the strongest and most in-depth lore in the game (hell they even got their own game modes and maps), and those champs have pick rates of 5% and under, while champs like Lee and Vayne, who have almost no lore at all, but DO have 'perceived strength' are 30+% \n\nso its safe to assume that people playing a champ because of their lore are an extreme minority, and if you intend to focus on the problem of certain champs being used in one third of all games, you need to not skirt around the issue by trying to make out like Lore and Champion theme are important, we all know that they aren't, in the end its the numbers that count, how much damage you can deal to someone else, and how little damage they can deal to you, thats all people seem to care about, and as much as that saddens me as someone who only plays champs because of their lore/looks/gameplay, its the truth, lore is just an extra (one that i personally love! but an extra none-the less)\n\n\nyou say in your post 'can we fix it? yes we can!' (bob the builder references aside) but you say:\n\"There is still work to be done but its going to take time, first we add the final touches to Marksmen rework throughout the preseason then we move onto the next group of champions.\"\n\ni dont want to be the barer of bad news but 'final touches' doesn't sound very promising when talking about toppling from power the champs that have dominated the rift all season, especially when the 'major' marksmen changes only made it worse.\nand 'then we move onto the next group of champions' again that doesn't inspire confidence, that is NOT going to solve Vayne/Jinx/Trist/Lucian, there are only 3 champs in the game with a pick rate of over 20% that ARENT ADC's and of them, Lee-Sin is the only one who isn't a support and so isn't vastly affected by the ADC's, so 'moving on to the next group of champions' is NOT going to solve the problem. \n\nI main Azir, and it saddens me that people lose to me in lane, not because i played better than them, but because they just have no idea what my champ even does, there just aren't enough around for people to learn, (i have had on multiple occasions to my astonishment, people even building armour against me) The same is true for Yorick, Zac, Evelynn etc. That shouldn't be the case, especially not at silver level.\n\nI know this post sounds like an attack, and it really isn't i swear, i agree with riot in most things and am an avid supporter, but its is so very frustrating just being lined up again and again and again and again and again, against the same 5/6 champs. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-08T07:58:33.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hoorah for kogmaw, they are buffing his early w, gutting his late w. 2% on all lv instead of an ad scale.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-12-08T07:11:56.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good comment.\n\nAs I say below, I don't know if even a nerf would fix things. Firstly, I don't really think Vayne is *too* OP. Thornmail, focusing down with good team tactics… easily dealt with like most other adcs. It's more the *perceived* power. How you can change a champion's perceived power though, without unfairly nerfing that champion, well I just don't know how you could do it.\n\nAnd yes to people not knowing what lesser-known champions do. If anything, that's why I enjoy playing less-played champions, because you do something cool and the enemy immediately goes to /all chat and asks \"WTF was that?! How did you survive/kill me!\". Like baiting people under tower with Zac's passive and you get a double kill because they didn't know you go into bloblets. Heck, it even happens when I play Blitz, who is more well-played! Someone seriously asked me the other day why I was getting a flat mana item.\n\nMaybe a game mode where you are forced to play champions that have a lower pick-rate? I know nemesis did that sort of, but this time the pool of champions you're forced to pick from are those that you have played less than 10% of the time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-12-07T08:37:46.487+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers for the reply.\n\nI definitely think the points you make re *why* champions are picked are accurate, but it doesn't explain why interesting-looking champions like Cho or Vel Koz are so seldomly picked. Or champions with fun/deep mechanics like Zac, Azir or Bard aren't picked often. Surely there are people out there like me who want to prove the opposite, and play less picked champions in various roles? I mean, I think I've played one game ever with a Galio, and maybe a handful of games with a Fiddles. He's a murderous scarecrow!\n\nIn terms of fixing the problem… will sweeping changes to roles really work? I mean you updated adcs. Before the changes, Vayne and Trist and Jinx got played consistently. But since the change, which should have introduced revamped adcs to the spot light, like Kog, Corki or Quinn, Vayne and Trist have been thrashed even *further*, and most other adcs have really declined in usage. As a support main, I was pretty excited to finally get the chance to support some new adcs! So imagine my confusion when the complete opposite happens.\n\nWhy this happened, no idea.\n\nIn any case, it's a small complaint. After all I'm keeping my end up with playing loads of different, \"under-powered\" champs in different roles, so it's not really a huge issue. I just think it's a waste to see so many cool champions go to waste.\n\nMaybe offering rewards for masteries in different champions would help, like a skin or icon. At least until players found a champion they really wanted to stick with, or completed all the level 5 masteries, you'd have a large proportion of players actively trying new champions. With new players each day, surely you'd always have at least one underplayed champion each side, each game.\n\nPerhaps leaderboards in different champions for each area? Or even for different roles? Being the best Yasuo or Vayne would be hard with so many people playing them, but being the best Yorick? Or Vayne support? That'd be more enticing to less-skilled players like myself. You could possibly even offer rewards like boosts or something for be proficient in different champs.\n\nI think the biggest change that would make a difference would be attitudes of players and winning. Yes you're right when it comes to perceived strength. Maybe if there was less emphasis on winning each game, and more on experimentation without being punished or flamed, it would make less people insta-lock in their \"strong\" mains every game, and instead try out new champions in new roles. I had a period where I mained Singed Support. It didn't matter if I was playing well or not, most teams flamed me for even picking such an uncommon choice. Players should be encouraged to experiment and fail, but instead of automatically reverting to their usual pick once they lose a game or get flamed by their team, they should be enticed to try again. Games like Dark Souls which reward failure, do this well.\n\nAnyway, those are just thoughts which probably will not make a difference. I don't see the trend bucking any time soon.

Can't actually do anything unless our team are completely steam-rolling her team all the way through or we've closed the game early in the cases where we haven't got a team comp that absolutely stomps theirs.\n\nI try not play her as much because of how broken this mechanic is... I mean there aren't many reveals in the game, she can squash tanks and all-inning her you need a crap ton of CC otherwise it's game: and she was already strong before they changed sweeping lense to no longer give true sight. She power spikes before other ADCs do at the late mid-game where you've got 3 items and your Last Whisper, even in a game with multiple late gamers, her power spike here where others would have previously had the old last whisper makes her shine above the rest because even though it gives a bit of damage amp, her passive proc and ease of purchasing attack speed right now make her damage output spike a crap load harder than other ADCs at this point (think {{item:3031}} {{item:3094}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3036}} Jinx vs Vayne with {{item:3087}} {{item:3094}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3036}} and where you have say an Irelia on your team as Jinx or something (because of how picks went if someone on your team has a late gamer too) - where previously with Last Whisper Jinx would power spike a lot harder, Vayne comes out on top overall because of the reduced efficacy of armor pen (with it only pen'ing bonus armor) and in most of my games she's been a problem for me or others and my win ratios with her climbed a fair lot and she's pretty easy to win with - her stealth mechanic just leaves people with no real options - then once it hits mid game or even late game, I run out of slots for pinks or cant place them effectively because of her dynamics or only one or two people have them or no one has them and this is where she power spikes so now its 10x worse, plus in the same patch they stopped games being easy to close out as fast so she sorta boomed in my opinion.\n\nI don't like using win rates etc, I just see her a lot and verse her a lot and played her a fair lot till I realized how OP she became and a 1 second stealth on a 2 second CD in a fight, with pinks not fitting in your inventory or not being useful at chasing her down consistently and no sweeping lense reveal and no pink ward trinket and a bunch of heavy IAS items and the new masteries and changes to ambient gold and with them undoing some of the early game GG'ing it overall in my opinion brought her to the dead top of power levels for anyone in this game, for all situations.\n\nShe can stick with the movespeed from 2 MS items too, coupled with her kit and passive MS she's 2 nasty.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-08T12:37:49.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"yeeeee. get a life.\n\nand fun fact, oracle alteration shows her location.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-12-08T13:03:01.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=jONAcWVA,comment-id=0003000200000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-12-08T12:37:49.470+0000)\n>\n> yeeeee. get a life.\n> \n> and fun fact, oracle alteration shows her location.\n\nIt's not helpful dude and it updates so slowly.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-08T11:42:04.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(dammit, he took a note of me spelling \"to\" wrong, I'm done for)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BlitzForever","date":"2015-12-06T16:26:06.485+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to OCE, where everyone tryhards with the same, easy to play and usually OP champs :)","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-12-07T09:58:08.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually carry more easily with master yi then my main.
