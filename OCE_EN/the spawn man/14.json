So the new Ryze update just hit Oceania, and I was really wanting some advice on how to play him, because let&#039;s be honest, he&#039;s changed a bit. I played a couple of games with him last night, and he&#039;s surprisingly good. He&#039;s much more of a threat early game, and can still melt faces late game. He&#039;s just different is all. He was my first champion, and sod it if I don&#039;t still love my little blue baldy.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m running my old core build on him:\r\n\r\n{{item:3003}} {{item:3027}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3259}}  with {{item:3135}} or {{item:3102}} as optional final items. And of course, Mag Pen marks, a mix of Flat/Scaling Armour seals, Scaling/Flat Mana glyphs, and 1 Movement Speed Quint and 2 Spell Vamp Quints. On old Ryze, it made for a bit of a sub-standard early game if the opponent was good/got ganks, due to my low range and poor escape, or a decent early game if the opponent was a dumbass and I got a lucky harass on him. Either way, the build always ended in Ryze being able to shred faces late game and carry, even if losing.\r\n\r\nHowever, I&#039;m not even sure if this is still a viable build on him. Desperate power now gives 30% CDR at max rank. I&#039;d probably be getting Frozen heart around the time it hits 2nd or 3rd rank anyway, so should I replace it?\r\n\r\nAnd how should I approach combos? Laning harass is *soooo* much easier now with the added range of Q (and the awesome mana shield, which always kicks in when you need it most it seems). But now that you can&#039;t really melt someone instantly if they&#039;re hiding in a creep wave with Q (part of the old infinite, roll-head-on-keyboard combo), what is the best combo for different situations, particularly duels in and around creeps, 1v1 and in teamfights. If it&#039;s changed at all ?\r\n\r\nAny advice on items and play style changes for the new Ryze would be appreciated! :)","replies":[{"poster":"randomy","date":"2015-05-03T01:09:28.098+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Strip all the CDR out of your build.  Getting 30% CDR from his ultimate means that Ryze hits the 40% cap with just his ult and blue buff - he's designed for you to build AP.  I'd go Tear > RoA > Archangel's > Luden's > Rabadon's.","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-05-03T11:52:12.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd be cautious to take out {{item:3065}} but yeah, definitely could take out {{item:3110}} for {{item:3285}} and then stick to {{item:3135}} or {{item:3157}} as optional final items. What do you think? :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LordR4in","date":"2015-05-13T17:30:22.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I forego {{item:3065}} and {{item:3157}} entirely because once you get late game, if you're doing well, these items won't be of much use. You will get target locked always. \n\nI prefer to go {{item:3026}} and {{item:3152}} as you will regain health really quickly, still have some mr and armor and if you die, you regain health back almost instantly.\n\nAs far as the core build, it remains the same {{item:3027}} and {{item:3040}} with some {{item:3020}} . The last item is chancy but definitely an AP item. Choices can go to:  {{item:3089}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3135}}.\n\nI have also been going {{item:3028}} when I need the extra sustain and I find myself upgrading it to {{item:3174}}. The cdr is kinda lost a bit on the later stages but the ap and the mr help quite a lot, not to mention the extra mana regen which makes your trips to the fountain much less needed and you end up doing a lot of roaming.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Autismo Extremo","date":"2015-05-04T04:40:08.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:1056}} {{item:1076}} {{item:1056}} {{item:1076}} {{item:1056}} {{item:1076}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-05-03T23:43:57.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3040}} {{item:3027}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3135}}","replies":[]}]}
