Have played a few ranked games since Patch 6.9 and since the patch was entered I cannot type anything in Champ Select. Well, I can type, and hit enter, but then it doesn&#039;t show up and no one can see it. Also, the word &#039;null&#039; is there next to my name like a clan tag sorta thing. I can still talk in chat, and in game, but just in champ select.\r\n\r\nAt first I thought I was chat restricted, but for what, I do not know, and of course, I received no notification. I can only assume this is a bug. Can someone explain to me please? : )","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-05-04T23:19:50.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey The Spawn Man,\n\nCan you try this solution and let me know if the problem persists?\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Pogba2k,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=G0wtwOpQ,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-05-04T22:44:45.787+0000)\n>\n> Go to View club/chat, and tick off the &amp;quot;Show club tags&amp;quot; and null will go away and you will be able to chat.\n> Temporary fix until its fixed.\n\nThanks!
