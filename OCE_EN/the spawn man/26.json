It&#039;ll be fun, I said. We&#039;ll destroy with our passive stacks I said.\r\n\r\nLIES.\r\n\r\nPlayed One for all today and we picked Kindred. Only one person got stacks. Well, a single stack, from killing a champion they marked. Killing jungle camps did *not* give stacks.\r\n\r\nA mark would show on the mini map. I would go over. Sometimes the mark wouldn&#039;t be above the creature. Other times it would fade in and out. Every time, it failed to give me any stacks. This is similar to what happened when Kindred was first released and there was that bug.\r\n\r\nSo what gives? I wanted to play Kindred and shred hp, but instead we got shredded. And yes, before you ask, I know that passives stack up to a certain amount from jungle camps, and that it&#039;s only enemy jungle camps, and that it&#039;s only the marked camps. I know all that. WHY were camps not giving me stacks??? Actually got me kinda tilted because I was doing everything correctly and nothing was working. :(","replies":[]}
