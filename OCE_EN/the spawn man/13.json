He&#039;s the first new champion I&#039;ve played in a while that I&#039;ve genuinely had a huge amount of fun with. They feel balanced, are easy to pick up, but still have plenty of room to grow. Especially as a support main, it makes me feel like I&#039;m actively a threat on the map instead of just some glorified baby-sitter/ward placer that occasionally deals with toxic fights and getting flamed. I can actually go gank lanes and be cool.\r\n\r\nLess of this &quot;hit three times and you do X extra effect&quot; or other lame stuff. More champions like Pyke. Fun mechanics. Cool theme. He&#039;s just fun. No one will probably see this, but thanks Riot! :)\r\n\r\n(Thought I&#039;d take a break from my usual rant posts haha).","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-06-18T07:18:53.707+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've got to agree, Pyke really feels like a good addition to LoL. He's interesting, exciting to play, and feels somewhat niche. The times I've found myself playing him (in ARAM) I've had fun, even if it's turned into a stomp on my team. I can't see myself seriously playing him in the future, but I can appreciate how well he turned out.\n\nGood job Riot!\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2018-06-22T02:13:35.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've gotten 2 Pentas with him in the last week haha.

There are so many champions with a hook ability - he is essentially the love child of {{champion:29}}{{champion:412}} and {{champion:122}}","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2018-06-22T01:54:05.124+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could say that about many champs though. So many abilities overlap in some way. The way he's put together though is great. I feel his abilities are super powerful in a lot of ways, but in a 5v5 Rift game, his role as a support definitely requires skill or you fall behind. If you play him like a conventional support, you will fail, so that is the trade off for slightly powerful abilities imo.","replies":[]}]}]}
