I would instead almost always use {{item:3174}} as a good base item, and as long as they didn&#039;t have loads of AD, and only use {{item:3165}} if I wanted early pressure and if the enemy team had loads of heals/no AP.\r\n\r\nNow I&#039;m thinking, is Athene&#039;s Unholy Grail only used by heal/shield champs (or more specifically supports like Morgana, Soraka and Janna?). The heal passive seems wasted on any other champs (it doesn&#039;t affect self-heals, correct ?), and other than a tiny bit of MR (which you would now certainly get on Abyssal Sceptre every time), seems far less superior to Morellonomicon, with a massive amount of mana and AP, and if you&#039;re in the thick of things, a very usable passive in the kill/assist mana regeneration. Morello also looks like it would be used outside of bot lane support, unlike Athene&#039;s which I cannot see anywhere but on the above champs in bot lane.\r\n\r\nThat said, do we even build *either* any more? They give decent base stats, but Morello is expensive as a first item and unless you&#039;re wanting to win extremely early, surely a Rod of Ages and then a Zhonya&#039;s or Abyssal would be better seeing you into late laning/mid game? Or one of the new Hextech items, which give good base stats and have utility? Or if you just want a butt-load of mana, {{item:3070}} ?\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s all very confusing for me, so if you can shed any light, please do! What roles/tactics/champs are Morello, Athene&#039;s (and to a lesser degree Rod of Ages and Tear of the Goddess) meant for? And do we build these items first? Or to fill in later in game?","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-05-04T05:04:38.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I changed my mind {{item:3165}} is great on champions who just wanna farm and poke. But to take full advantage of its passive pick up  Lost chapters asap. \n\nFor most mages who are mana inefficient  {{item:3070}} and {{item:3010}}  provide a lot early game allowing you to trade and refunding 15% of all the mana you use.  {{item:3010}}  and {{item:3070}}  honestly seems like the best start to me.  Poke oriented mages probably won't want this too much but for those who have to fight in a close range and are heavily reliant on mana this is ideal. {{champion:13}}  {{champion:34}} \n\nFor damage oriented early mages, {{item:3285}}  or {{item:3100}} , Ap assassins and burst mages will most definitely go for this.  {{champion:1}}  {{champion:105}} \n\n{{item:3157}}  if you're against an AD mid {{champion:238}}  {{champion:91}} , who deals a lot of burst. If you can win early just hold onto {{item:3191}}  and complete {{item:3157}} later. \n\n{{item:3174}}  seems to be for healing/shielding supports {{champion:16}}  {{champion:40}}  \n\n{{item:3001}}  was a great choice against AP mid but again I think the changes have made it much more of a later item. You could still easily make use of the {{item:1057}}  {{item:3211}}  early regardless. \n\n {{item:3115}}  if you're attack speed reliant.  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:10}} \n\nMana less AP champions or mana efficient AP champs could probably start teching into the Hextech items early on. {{champion:84}} \n \nAlso if you're tight on mana in the early game  and just want to farm early on, you can always pick up a{{item:3303}}   with an extra {{item:1056}} \n\nMaybe someone else can give better advice but this is what I reckon. \n\n\nI don't know what do you other people reckon, am i right or am I totally wrong?","replies":[]}]}
