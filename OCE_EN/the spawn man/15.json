It&#039;s themed around a construction or road site. Think overalls, jackhammers and yellow helmets. Here&#039;s some ideas for some champs&hellip;\n\nConstruction Ammumu. He&#039;s in the porta-potty/mobile toilet. He&#039;s got a wee helmet on, but unfortunately, Site Foreman Gragas is in the cubicle next to him and has mistaken his mummy wraps for toilet paper. This makes Ammumu sad. He could have blue particle effects like the blue cleaning agent in the mobile toilets, and when he presses b to recall, an actual mobile toilet/porta-potty appears and he gets in to recall.\n\nAs I mentioned, Site Foreman Gragas is in the cubicle next to Ammumu. He&#039;s got boss clothes on, a clip board and a special yellow helmet. A lot of construction workers are&hellip; heavy set&hellip; so Gragas would fit right in!\n\nConstruction Jarvan! Instead of a sword he throws in the ground, it&#039;s a jackhammer! And instead of a stone arena, it&#039;s little &#039;Under construction&#039; signs and sand bags! He can have overalls on and when he recalls, he can start jack hammering the ground!\n\nCement mixer Singed. Yep, so more nasty chemicals, Singed has traded in poison for cement! He is literally holding a cement mixer, and cement comes out for his Q. And when he flings champions, he could have a little shovel that does it.\n\nConstruction Nasus. Could have a sledge hammer for his Q. And his E is a giant imprint of a STOP sign, or maybe an &#039;Under Contruction&#039; sign. He could have like a buff cropped white tee shirt under blue overalls.\n\nRoad Crew Soraka. She&#039;s got the &#039;Go/Stop&#039; sign that road workers have and a nifty hard helmet and overalls. Like Nasus, her AoE particle could be a giant stop sign! Goes well with the 'Silence' aspect of her spell too.\n\nAnd I&#039;ve got this idea of Sion ultimating and running down lanes with a full wheelbarrow ahead of him. \n\nAnyways, there are some ideas. Probably most champs would look good in construction uniforms, but the ones above could have little special touches that I&#039;ve mentioned.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-08-30T07:11:03.583+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not bad","replies":[]}]}
