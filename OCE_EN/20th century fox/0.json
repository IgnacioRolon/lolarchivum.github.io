However, there has been some bugs or something similar such as League isn&#039;t updated to Windows 10 so that doesn&#039;t allow players to play League, is this true? I wouldn&#039;t mind having Windows 10 on my PC although I won&#039;t be able to play League if this true information (that league does not work on windows 10). Also I didn&#039;t know where to put this thread under so yeah...\r\n\r\nHappy feeding, summoners!","replies":[{"poster":"Lara Croft","date":"2015-08-04T13:26:22.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've upgraded my computer to Windows 10 Pro and I've got some issues. I can run the game in different compatibility modes. If I use the game without compatibility mode I can launch it, login, join a quque and select a champion. But the game won't actually load and I have to close it and switch over to High DPI Scaling mode which in turn will give me a black login screen and black PVP.net screen. I can kinda guess where the password text box is and login and then hover around to click the Reconnect button. The game loads in and I can play.\n\nThis is a very tedious and annoying method but I haven't found any other solution. The game did work properly before the recent patch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"StamatisKokotas","date":"2015-08-03T11:43:16.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Windows 10 (Final) is out and runs league fine on my PC","replies":[]}]}
