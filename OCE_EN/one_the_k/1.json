May I ask if anyone is having the same problem? or is it my computer problem or wt?\r\n\r\nAlso during ban fro the nexus mode, I have experienced 4 time of lagging on banning the champ and suddenly quit game because of the server then add us back in but we have lost all 3 banning chance, and it just lag the hell up.
