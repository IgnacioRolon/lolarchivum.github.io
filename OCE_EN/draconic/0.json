I hate the fact that people who try to do the right thing are penalised and those who caused the problem are free to queue up again right away. Thanks for reading and any suggestions for how this system would be cool to know.\nUp vote to get Riot to look into this","replies":[{"poster":"Oceanic Man","date":"2016-02-24T11:26:48.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its still almost as bad even with the new champ select. i got mid when i went in game and this guys said he was first pick and he wanted mid but got jg and i was forced under my feet to \"obey\" him. and this doesnt prevent trolls from well.... trolling. i was forced to dodge a queue simply because someone wanted to go AP mid wukong and i wasnt about to risk it. was my frist dodge in ranked and i got 10LP taken off and 30 min. i think they got the timers wrong but honestly cant be stuffed","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-12-13T06:20:40.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The new champ select is fixing most of these problems.
