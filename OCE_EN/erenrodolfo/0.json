And that&#039;s awesome because we are so so much more then that.\r\nSecondly, the love. We&#039;ve been fighting for the right for love and being loved for so long, and we have such a long way to go, although we just got equal marriage approved  in Australia there are so many places that our love is illegal. And Riot made it so beautiful how their love is giving Kai and Val power to fight against the Darkin, and protect the world fro it. Love is that powerful, and gay love is not different\r\nLast but not least, League of Legends is one of the most played games in the world, and this incredible message is traveling to places that people are not even allowed to talk about it.\r\nWell done and thank you so much Riot! I&#039;m looking forward  to the next LGBT champ!!!\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} \r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \r\n{{sticker:sg-lux}}","replies":[]}
