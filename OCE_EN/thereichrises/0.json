The system as it stands basically penalizes anyone who may get slightly emotional at having an intentional feeder on their team whos also trash talking you, and lets that person walk away scot free? What a completely absurd way to monitor the &quot;toxicity&quot; of players. \r\n\r\nSo we basically are not allowed to express ANY level of emotion towards someone who may be wasting your time and ruining a game, otherwise the account that you spend real money on is subject to be PERMANENTLY banned without any chance for a refund? \r\n\r\nI just cannot believe the level of ineptitude being expressed by the suspension/ban team.. They are clearly trigger happy and completely overreact. Every single online gaming community is far more toxic than league is.. It is part of our natural response to be frustrated with someone who is wasting our time, even if you express the smallest amount of distaste, you are automatically subject to being punished by the very person who ruined the game for you? \r\n\r\nWhat a ludicrous system this is. Do you people actually look at whats happening in the game when these things take place? Or do you just look at the dialogue and assume &quot;toxicity&quot;, even though these things may be perfectly justified? \r\n\r\nI literally feel like riot has just robbed me. How is this even legal?","replies":[{"poster":"Orange Caramel","date":"2017-02-26T10:23:08.200+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"- Trash talking/toxic.\n- Swearing.\n- Insulting people with neurological disorders.\n- Telling others to report someone.\n\nWhat don't you get about being banned?\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2017-02-26T09:23:38.970+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Definetly worth a ban and if you have had previous bans then thats perma ban worthy","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kakoda","date":"2017-02-26T05:50:26.836+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah look, I read the first part and was like yeah man this ain't good.
