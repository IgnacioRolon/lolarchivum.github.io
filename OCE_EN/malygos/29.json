Malta\r\nSung by a woman 6 months pregnant, she absolutely nailed it. V catchy song, I love it.\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58YS5m3EYVY\r\n\r\n2. Belgium\r\nSuper rad retro groove dance, I&#039;m into it.\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDBjhAGaeWg\r\n\r\n3. Spain\r\nA song about failure that did some cool stuff (falling over is a 10/10 dance move)\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgbjNsxehrY\r\n\r\n4. Australia\r\nI had no idea who Dami was before this, but she has an incredible voice. I don&#039;t enjoy the song so much (WE WOULD HAVE WON IF THE 2ND LINE DIDN&#039;T HAVE FUCKING FACETIME IN IT I SWEAR)\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ymFX91HwM0\r\n\r\n5. France\r\nEverything was just pretty rad, dug the French, dug the English, dug the display; dug it all.\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aLPsiyavcU\r\n\r\n6. Russia\r\nPutin sent his finest magician to perform magic and music.\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e94dst20C9Y\r\n\r\n7. Cyprus\r\nSomething a little less homo.\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idUxTqmCFR0\r\n\r\n8. Bulgaria\r\nI like glow arrow lady, she was cool.\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQqUTigWKHY","replies":[]}
