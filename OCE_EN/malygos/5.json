Levels 1-4 are extremely fast, you can easily get to level 3 in a single victory, but if you're losing it takes a bit longer and so it should because you need more time to learn your hero. While this may seem an intrusive system, it works and rarely decides a game.\r\n[I should note in a future patch, once you reach level 30 (40 is max) in HotS all talent gating is removed regardless of your hero level because Blizzard understands you know the game enough by that point)\r\n\r\nAt level 5, you earn 500 gold (works the same as IP), so you're rewarded for learning to play a wide range of heroes.\r\n\r\nAt level 6, you unlock a summoner icon for that hero (as well as a colour variation for your mount)\r\n\r\nAt level 7 and 8, you unlock a different colour variation for your hero for free (remember Riot's old 520 RP recolours? Yeah, those but free and earned for committing to a hero)\r\n[Applies to all skins for that hero- 3 colour options each]\r\n\r\nAt level 9, you earn a master summoner icon (just a gold border around the icon you got at level 6, but it shows you've really committed to that hero) as well as another mount colour variation.\r\n\r\nAt level 10, you unlock the ability to purchase a \"master skin\" for that hero for 10,000 gold (approx. 6300 IP equivalent). This master skin features your hero in what could be their final form so to speak.\r\n\r\nCurrently in HotS level 10 is the max, but in a patch coming soon it will be raised to 20 with more unique rewards tied to it.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, Blizzard put thought into this system. They've made it fun and rewarding, as well as making it an integral part of learning the game.\r\n\r\nNow, onto League's system...\r\n\r\nI don't know where to begin. So maybe I'll start with how expecting Riot to produce a system like HotS has is unfair, because LoL is an established and aged game- to prepare 2 recolours for all skins + a master skin in 3 different colours is an absurdly difficult task and Riot's Ultimate skins already fit the purpose of Master skins.\r\n\r\nBut that doesn't mean they couldn't have done better. \r\n\r\nFirstly: Why aren't champion summoner icons a thing? Surely this would have been the easiest way to please the community out of all the things you've added to this system. This is something people have been begging for since beta.\r\n\r\nSecondly: League of Legends has the biggest gating mechanics in champion diversity out of any moba for new players. Champions are expensive, and you need runes and rune pages to even be remotely competitive with them. Why not have something like HotS has where IP boosts / rewards are provided for learning different heroes at a basic level to help lower this gating issue.\r\n\r\nThirdly: The reward system needs a serious overhaul. You don't get anything until level 4- at which point you get everything. There's no easing into it, nothing to promote \"Hey just keep going a little longer at level 2 you get _____!\"\r\n\r\nFourthly: While a master skin and recolours is too much, surely you could have done much better with the custom emotes. Even something as small as recycling some particle effects (E.g. in Rengar's taunt when he slashes his knife it could leave the red trail his empowered Q has). Just flashing the badge above your head is... dull. Boring. Repetitive across all champions. It doesn't reflect anything about the character.\r\n\r\nFinally: Loading screen badges and profile banners. Lol. I'm sorry, but these are the two aspects of the client that nobody bothers to look at or take note of. Remember: Summoner icons are everywhere and people take note of and see them.\r\n\r\nI didn't mention the announcement thingy because Riot didn't elaborate on it or provide an example, I'm just going to assume it shows the same rank badge as your custom emotes around your kill call outs or something.\r\n\r\n\"We'll elaborate on it in the future\"\r\n\r\nThis is Riot Games, if you hold any faith in these words just remember that they said the same thing about the honour system and \"the spectator client is the first step into adding replays\" or even \"Limited edition skins will never return to the store\". Riot doesn't hold anything to their word, they change it on a whim as it pleases them.\r\n\r\nIn short: This new system is a laudable mockery of HotS's system, has little to no thought put into it and reeks of \"They did it so we have to\".","replies":[{"poster":"MasterMirkinen","date":"2015-03-12T03:08:06.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the amount of thoughts you put in this post Malygos, thank you!\n\nI haven't played much HotS so I cannot comment on their system.\nAs for LOLs mastery system, this is just the beginning and with feedback like yours, this feature can only improve. \n\nI just want to comment on this sentence \n>This is Riot Games, if you hold any faith in these words just remember that they said the same thing about the honour system and \"the spectator client is the first step into adding replays\" or even \"Limited edition skins will never return to the store\".

For a company that boasts how community focused they are, I've never felt more powerless as a player. I'm not even talking about power to change, merely power to discuss. Fearful smothering of discussions, silences and blatantly ignoring certain things at times.\n\nRiot as a company scares me, because of the power they now hold within gaming communities. \nRiot as a community is so expansive and so much comes out of it, it's awesome.\n\nI just wish the two could join like Riot the company says it is.\n\nThank you for your time Mirky :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-11T23:42:26.177+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very interesting concept!
