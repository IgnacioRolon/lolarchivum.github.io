It has the tones of fantasy and little more, this is most obvious in the language used. \r\n\r\nNothing about the new lore makes it stand out as League of Legends. The unique world of Runeterra has no branding, it&#039;s just &quot;this is a fantasy environment&quot; complete with way too much mist and smoke in every image or nonsensical &quot;this means it&#039;s fantasy&quot; gibberish in every name.\r\n\r\nNot to mention Demacia&#039;s &quot;We do everything white because we&#039;re the GOOD GUYS&quot; and Noxus&#039;s &quot;We&#039;re gritty and dirty because we&#039;re the BAD GUYS&quot;.\r\n\r\nComplete with the very original Blue and Gold team vs Red and Black team. Never seen that one before, nope not at all.\r\n\r\nEvery image looks like the kind of thing you&#039;d find on the back of a boardgame box because there&#039;s nothing else to put there and I&#039;m just so lost as to why Riot would want to take this direction. \r\n\r\nAnd don&#039;t get me started on how triggered I get while trying to read the extended stories for champions. Everything about the language is offputting.","replies":[]}
