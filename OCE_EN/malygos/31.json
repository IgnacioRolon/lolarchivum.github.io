You left me feeling...\nLike a fading voice, like a closing door; like a dozen lies and a dozen more.\nLike a twisted tongue, like distant bark, when we broke out in the dark.\n\nThe stars looked like burning sparks&mdash;the lights were warm but chilling.\nYou left me feeling... tired; could not close my eyes. On fire&mdash;but frozen inside...\nTo run or to hide, speechless my words could not melt&mdash;whisper I wanted to shout.\n\nWith out you I felt... like a fleeting thought, like a double eight; like a gentle feel of a warming taste.\nLike a placid breath, like a cool wind blows&mdash;when you stopped and held me close.\n\nInside I nearly froze, your touch is almost healing.\nYou left me feeling... tired; could not close my eyes. On fire&mdash;but frozen inside...\nTo run or to hide, speechless my words could not melt&mdash;whispered, I wanted to shout.\n\nWith out you I felt... like a setting sun; like a last goodbye&mdash;like an incomplete lullaby.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/sYBa3g5.png\nRest in peace, my sweet.\n21/8/12&mdash;3/4/14","replies":[]}
