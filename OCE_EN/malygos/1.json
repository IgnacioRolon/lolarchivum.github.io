Boards.\r\n\r\nThis place is desolate, old GD in the dead of the night was more active than this place is at the best of times. Our community, at its most full couldn't support a system like Boards, and at this time, it's just pitiful.\r\n\r\nThe community is the reason I continued playing this game when I found the gameplay dull and uninteresting. This community just feels so very dead.\r\n\r\nHow can Riot claim they're community focused, when changes such as Boards have the complete opposite effect? \r\n\r\nI probably won't check this thread again, maybe in a month if it's still on the front page; judging from the activity of the place it's not entirely unlikely.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-01-09T02:12:21.142+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not Riot's fault that the old GD posters refuse to post on the boards.\n\nWe were given ample warning that we will have boards and nothing was going to stop it.
