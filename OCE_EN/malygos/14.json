I THINK (my opinion, not others) should play the game for what they started playing it for, enjoy playing with your friends, climbing the ranked ladder, whatever the fun you have with the game may be. Skins are cool and such but it literally makes ZERO difference to the play if the game and the fun you have.","replies":[]}]}
