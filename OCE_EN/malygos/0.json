I do not find this style of forums engaging- I think it's an eyesore and I do not like the types of discussion it promotes. \r\n\r\nTo old friends: You know I'll still be in touch.\r\nTo new faces: I hope you can enjoy all this community has to offer. \r\n\r\nI could rant, I could try make points but instead I'll keep it short and sweet:\r\nI've played League for over 4 years now, the game (and company behind it) is entirely different to what I fell in love with. My previous game has remarried me and my desire to play League is so low I even decline friends asking me to play. I love this community, and it's all that kept me playing for a long year after I stopped enjoying League, but alas it cannot last.\r\n\r\nFarewell, I love you all.\r\n\r\n*Don't grieve for me, for now I'm free,\r\nI'm following the path God laid for me.\r\nI took his hand when I heard his call,\r\nI turned my back and left it all.*\r\n\r\n*I could not stay another day,\r\nTo laugh, to love, to work, to play.\r\nTasks left undone must stay that way,\r\nI've found that peace at the close of the day.*\r\n\r\n*If my parting has left a void,\r\nThen fill it with remembered joy.\r\nA friendship shared, a laugh, a kiss,\r\nAh yes, these things I too will miss.*\r\n\r\n*Be not burdened with times of sorrow,\r\nI wish you the sunshine of tomorrow.\r\nMy Life's been full, I savoured much,\r\nGood friends, good times, a loved one's touch,*\r\n\r\n*Perhaps my time seemed all too brief,\r\nDon't lengthen it now with undue grief.\r\nLift up your heart and share with me,\r\nGod wanted me now, He set me free.*\r\n\r\nFurret out~\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/PiiRXgt.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2014-11-26T11:18:42.625+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Just what are the \"Types of discussions it promotes\" same community different forum layout I don't think the latter should effect discussions too much so unless your saying the change also changed the community I don't understand what you mean.","replies":[{"poster":"Silver5aruman","date":"2014-11-26T15:42:27.516+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> Just what are the \"Types of discussions it promotes\" same community different forum layout I don't think the latter should effect discussions too much so unless your saying the change also changed the community I don't understand what you mean.\n\nThe change drastically effects how communication works and just allows for circlejerking like reddit.
