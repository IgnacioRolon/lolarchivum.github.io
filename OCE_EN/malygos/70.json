I got through Maokai and Hecarim just fine because Rumble could kite them for days on end, but the Yorick fight is too much for me. \n\nThe first phase is fine, usually I&#039;ll set up Teemo to switch to the green ghoul and have Poppy out the front, then I&#039;ll get Rumble to come in from the back once he&#039;s channeling his summon. The first wave of ghoul spam I can cover with Rumble&#039;s flamespitter, and the second one I kite into Teemo shrooms (which doesn&#039;t seem like a great strategy atm, I know in the 3rd phase he&#039;ll call on the big blue ghoul I&#039;ll need mushrooms to kite). For the third wave I was going to use Veigar to nuke them, but I slacked on the Nunu fight back in Freljord because I screwed up near the end of my kill and didn&#039;t want to restart. Veigar&#039;s currently 67% dark, and if I nuke the ghouls he goes up to 73% which is way too close to the 75% insta-fail for my run. \n\nI&#039;m just sort of stumped. Do I need to go back to Bandle City for Ziggs? I didn&#039;t want to bring him because between Teemo and Rumble I can kite most things, but not having AoE here is really rough. If I manage things really hard, I can trip Yorick into 2nd phase but I go through so many of my abilities the red ghoul lives too long and usually heals him up enough for a 2nd cycle.\n\nAlso I&#039;ve heard on a Veigar redemption run he has a 4th phase but I don&#039;t know anything about it. One of my friends said you just need huge throughput to take him out or I&#039;ll just instantly lose. If I don&#039;t have Rumble&#039;s ult for it I&#039;ll probably fail that, so I&#039;m not sure I can use it in the first phase.\n\nAnd yes, I am running the Solari Crest on Poppy. The damage ignore is too good for an add fight like this.","replies":[]}
