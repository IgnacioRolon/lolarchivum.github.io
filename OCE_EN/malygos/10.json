That's precisely why we acknowledge say Elder Scrolls, Witcher and Souls to be completely different games even though 80% of each game is a completely clone to everyone else, because that's why we say they're in the same genre.\n\nHarping on a few champs in LoL for having same skills as certain few in DotA would be like complaining why Skyrim has dragon bone weapons/armour while Dark Souls also has them or something along the lines, you get the idea.\n\nIt really depends on how much is ported from DotA to LoL, a few champ's skill overlap imo really isn't that much of a big deal since both games already have different mechanical emphasis and focus anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sunlit Earth","date":"2015-05-14T11:01:13.755+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Google Kirby Ferguson's video series \"Everything is a remix\" as it'll give you a broader perspective of what is defined as creativity and combine that with whatever knowledge you have of what motivates businesses.
