The General Discussion subboard is now open, which behaves almost exactly like the old forums.**\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion\n\n\n\n\nAnd I really really want to emphasise the **your** in my title. Out here, in Oceania we&#039;re cut off from your parent company. This isn&#039;t an appeal to Riot Games, this is an appeal to Riot Games **Oceania**.\n\nSince the beginning of the OCE server in June of 2013, you guys have done a wonderful job of fostering League of Legends within our region. From all I&#039;ve seen, there has been an excellent movement to publicise all kinds of League related events throughout our region. From conventions in New Zealand I&#039;ve never even heard of to Teemo Parties and all of that. \n\nHowever, here, on your own website there is a community that you have neglected. From the beginning, and to the end of your old forum system a very tightknit group of players grew and grew. With the release of boards, that community scattered. \n\nI&#039;ve said it so many times before I won&#039;t waste much time on it but plain and simple boards does not work for a community of this size. Its lack of functionality is the reason why so many old forumers left this place behind and it&#039;s the reason why this place is so lacking in activity. Hell I came across another bug while I was typing this thread up, but that&#039;s not the focus of this post.\n\nThe focus of this post is right here.\nhttp://puu.sh/kyWYt/020dd498cb.png\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/lb2Orerp-do-you-prefer-these-boards-or-traditional-style-forums\n\nAt the time of posting this thread, 29/38, or 76.3% of people prefer the forum system. \n38 people isn&#039;t much, and I intended to let the poll stay up for a week or so before I made this thread but due to the functionality of boards I was unable to bump the thread and receive fair results as once the post became hidden it would just become me preaching to old forumers, so this thread is coming now.\n\nRiot Games Oceania, I want you to understand that the nature of your boards is crushing to a small community. The old forums were accused of circlejerking but I&#039;m not kidding when I say the only way for a popular thread on these boards is by circlejerking a popular opinion. \n\nThe power of the downvote or the pressure of not posting popular thoughts:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ_3uVYh1io\nHere is an incredibly ghetto video I made showing the effect one single bad cookie can have on boards. One click, and I censored a thread. When I upvoted the thread after, it stayed on top of the boards for quite a while until someone later downvoted it and it fell well over halfway down the page.\n\nFunnily enough, this issue is sort of counterbalanced by how deserted this place is. You saw when I sorted threads back by new, it was still the 2nd thread on the list. This is not a good thing. That thread was 4 hours old. \n\nI know this has been tried before, I know many people think I&#039;m wasting my efforts. Why would I be trying again? \nThis quote gave me hope.\nhttp://puu.sh/kvzLw/5cd8d6b605.png \n(source: http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/yHhIOYjO-letos-talk-about-the-server-skin)\n\n&quot;Each region gets to operate autonomously&quot;\nFirstly I&#039;d like to apologize to Loote for taking this quote out of context, but that simple sentence has spawned this determination within me. I want to show how much us old forumers miss GD. I want our community to take part.\n\nI want everyone who reads this thread to take the time to explain their favourite story spawned by using Riot&#039;s forums (be they the old forums or boards). Friends, ranked teams, games or maybe someone helped you with an issue. Just post it here, please.\n\nI&#039;ll start with my own right now.\n\nJuly 2014, the OCE server had been around for about a year and I had found new friends out in distant places. At this time, there was a Game of Thrones art and prop something or rather happening in Sydney and I was incredibly happy to find out Jack/Alpha, Jakeb/A naive Skitty, and Jordan/Butterfly were coming to Sydney to see it. I met up with them, along with Elliot/Toille, Grace/Evulpix, Adrian/A barbaric Seel and David/Wolfie. It was Jakeb/Skitty&#039;s birthday and we all wanted something special for him when David/Wolfie mentioned he might know where Riot Games Oceania&#039;s offices might be. We set out on a trek across Sydney to try find these offices, and found the previous location. From here, Wolfie was able to sweet talk the new address out of someone and we were off.\n\nWithin 20 minutes, we were standing outside Riot&#039;s office. All of us were grinning like fools and a little bit shaky, it was like a dream. We were let in, and shook hands with Mirkinen, Sephyre, Crucius, Loote, Toxichawk, Marauder and Benji. We played games with the Rioters on their own stage and Riot handed us all skin codes, all in all I think it was the best birthday Jakeb could have had and all of us loved it.\n\nFrom forum friends, to closer internet friends, to meeting up in the real world and raiding Riot&#039;s offices, the forums have provided me with incredibly unique experiences. \n\nAnd frankly, seeing boards in this state is rather depressing.\n\nSincerely,\nA bouncy Furret.","replies":[{"poster":"Jack","date":"2015-10-05T10:20:05.807+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I _could _ make a huge post but few words will speak more in this case.\nIt hurts that it's gone, it really does. **We **loved it, **we **all made friends on this place and **we ** worked hard to keep it thriving, then **you **took it away.\n\nYou made a mistake and it stung to the point that my favourite game lay unused for 6 months, when I played _15 games every day for 2 years_.\nShould speak for itself.","replies":[{"poster":"Malygos","date":"2015-10-05T10:24:29.583+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jack,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=74pAu1s8,comment-id=000e,timestamp=2015-10-05T10:20:05.807+0000)\n>\n> I _could _ make a huge post but few words will speak more in this case.\n> It hurts that it's gone, it really does. **We **loved it, **we **all made friends on this place and **we ** worked hard to keep it thriving, then **you **took it away.\n> \n> You made a mistake and it stung to the point that my favourite game lay unused for 6 months, when I played _15 games every day for 2 years_.\n> Should speak for itself.\n\nWell said.

I saw Dartz mention you guys still have a chat group in client.\n\nUnfortunately quite a few of us quit playing without the community anchoring our enjoyment of the game. I've returned recently and noticed how poorly all the previously active facets of this community were doing. The chat room in the client is alive, but it's pretty depressing. Lately it's been a bit more lively, the main problem with the room is it seems like there's a lot of people in there who don't ever really talk :(\n\n> It's really great to read about all the stories from you guys about how you all met online and built strong bonds through that.\n\nThough we can seem bitter, we are all very grateful of the environment you built for us and allowed us to thrive in for a long time. A lot of us really cherish those memories, it was a very unique experience in my gaming career. I felt like I belonged to a game in a sense greater than just playing it. \n\n> Now I'm not saying we can bring back the old forums (vBulletin was just not a good software for us and [we've talked about why we moved to boards previously.)](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/TlzBKw6t-oce-boards-thoughts-and-opinions?comment=00000002000000000001)\n> \n> But maybe we can set up something with similar functionality for you here on the boards?

I know NA Boards had something similar, and at the time the community was still reeling from the transition. On a functional level, it's very comparable to the old forums. The format and how it is displayed is still a bit of an eyesore, but that's personal preference and I'd put up with it to have the GD community back. \n\nMy only concerns are the bugs boards had (has?). From all I've heard these boards don't get updated very often and have been in beta for almost a year now (or maybe it has been a year, I forget). But 'tis just hear-say, and I'd be receptive to hearing otherwise. \n\nI understand vBulletin's issues, and I'm certainly biased towards having everything nice and neatly back how it could be before, but I'm not that naive. I spoke to Crucius last night to get a better understanding of the whole situation and he certainly did a great job of giving me a riot perspective of the situation. \n\nMaraudaur, thank you. I'd love to see a GD-style subforum on these boards and I hope my friends and other posters do too. It would certainly negate the majority of issues I personally have with boards.\n\nMuch love :)","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-10-06T00:37:02.549+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Let me see about getting that sub board set up for the GD community soon. \n\nIn the mean time if there are any glaring bugs that you know of let me know and I will raise it to get it fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"Malygos","date":"2015-10-06T00:45:02.872+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maraudaur,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=74pAu1s8,comment-id=001500010000,timestamp=2015-10-06T00:37:02.549+0000)\n>\n> Let me see about getting that sub board set up for the GD community soon. \n> \n> In the mean time if there are any glaring bugs that you know of let me know and I will raise it to get it fixed.\n\nwell for starters I can't upvote this comment :p (I'm clicky clicky but its not doing anything)\nWhen refreshing the thread, or clicking on a comment link the scrolling is really unresponsive (will constantly try to scroll to the comment and sometimes randomly decides to scroll back to the comment if I move away from it)\n\nI think there's also a pretty annoying bug where lv 30 accounts can't post because they're apparently below lv 5.

To the average person, you could see that the Oceanic forums were an amazing group of people, a quite tight-knit community. To me, those people were a family. I started playing league due to a couple of mates from school, whom I shorty after had a falling out with a few weeks after the Oceanic servers came out. I was completely prepared to quit playing altogether when I found my way to this place. It didn't take me too long until I found my home, right here. I remember a time where i'd be sitting in class on the GD forums instead of doing my work just so I could chat with people. Every day I was excited to get home and hop on league so I could play games and spend time with these amazing guys in the in-client GD chat room (which we still have by the way, there isn't very many people around a lot of the time, but we're here! Just join \"General Discussion\")!\n\nQuite some months down the track, people started to take breaks from the game. I ended up being one of them. Since returning, I found the forums gone, and the boards here. The community here is dead. The GD chat room still has its veterans that pop in for a while, but there isn't really any newbies coming in, it's kinda sad. The time I spent with these people in my life was very enjoyable to say the least, and I want other people to experience that too.
