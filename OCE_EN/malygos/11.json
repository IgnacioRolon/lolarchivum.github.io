When boards was released I originally saw a lot of people QQing about the colour scheme, while I don't like it by any means I don't find it insufferable... The issue with boards for me is readability issues, big ones. \n\nI like the idea that we can swap to a more forum-esque layout but the issue is it simply doesn't work. You can't see who's replying to who or anything, and I think the reddit layout is flawed from the beginning, it heavily promotes circlejerking popular opinions rather than actual discussion - anyone with an unpopular opinion is downvoted and their opinion is just hidden and ignored. On reddit if your posts are downvoted a bit more than upvoted you can be automatically shadowbanned - you can still post threads but noone will be able to see them, which, as I shouldn't have to say, is fucking disgusting.\n\nThe lack of being able to bump old threads also hurts badly, I get that you want new content but sometimes it's far, far better to be able to bring up old threads rather than making new ones - remember all those streamer threads on old GD? Would you rather one, bumped when a streamer starts streaming, or 30 of the same thing?\n\nEven though I'm a pessimist, I'm still posting this. Why, you ask? Because I miss what old GD was, and I don't think boards works for actual discussion purposes like I said earlier, it's just circlejerk bullshit. I miss the shitposters, the 300 page threads of meaningless chatting, things like player pics (even though I never posted a real pic lol), forum game threads, stories, and the community as a whole. Boards killed us, the soul of GD lives on but the only way it's coming back is if its body is restored, I think.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-10-03T06:52:33.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very true.

All it takes is for a few down votes from trolls and a post gets buried for everyone. Sure this board system stops thread necromancy but unless someone is looking for something they will likely not find anything beyond a page or two, whereas bumping your own stuff or things you found interesting could help keep topics or just conversations alive. I rarely search for things anymore either. \n\nI feel that the board type fragmented the ability for conversations that forums had. Now I'm lucky to be bothered with interesting questions/content from other people because the crap stays at the surface. Also, every time I see the word boards I think \"You have to be pretty _bored _ to go to the boards.\"\n\nSure I can use the champion icons to write short dialogues with them saying something funny but it is just not the same. Bumping them was the only way to let people know I hadn't finished if it disappeared too quick or just to give it some more exposure but hey even adding more won't even bring it back to the top now. If people give a shit they will have to search for it but can anyone be bothered now? A post might have one or two responses but too bad if you want more and no one goes looking for your thread.\n\nI know I'm just going around in circles here but that is it really, the problems just keep remaking themselves. At least the forums had a flow to them, a shift. It actually felt alive. When no one was posting a dead forum felt dead but it was only temporary, people would come and go.

Our posterbase wasn't large enough to support a system like boards and the posters clearly didn't enjoy it as much and many left as a result.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ivy Valentine","date":"2015-10-03T04:07:27.691+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Forums for sure. \n\nWhen a community is small enough for a chronological view to keep most posts on the front page for half a day, it's pretty sustainable.
