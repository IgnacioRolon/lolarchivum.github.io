I almost a little bit recognised what music you listened to in the sense of &quot;those are dulled and muffled sounds that could literally be anything&quot;\nI saw some form of waifu on your phone background while I was judgi-- plotting. \n\nSo you&#039;re probably quite lost, but I guess you should get used to that. \n\nHere are my conditions: you find a way to revert the Rengar rework AND bring about the release of Battlebunny Rengar. \n\nI understand the difficulty in communicating with NA Riot, so your first few punishments for failure will be more motivational. \n\nAn awkward stare next time we meet. \nA loud one sided conversation that everyone will hear and look strangely at us. \nAn oddly intimate and lasting thigh to thigh contact. \n\nIt gets worse. \n\nYou have 6 months. \n\nGood luck :]\n\nalso revert new traditional Trundle splash art\nundo all lore advancements in the past few years including the mass retconning\nbring back the journal of justice\ndelete lee sin\ngut kha'sucks\nstop all forms of the lcs and return to traditional tournaments","replies":[]}
