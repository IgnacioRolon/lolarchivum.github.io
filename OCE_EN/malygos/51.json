He had an awesome silhouette and just in general it was a very cohesive design.\r\n\r\nNew Yorick is... boring. Just. So. Boring. Like, REALLY boring.\r\n\r\nI feel like every time I see a visual update, the world of Runeterra loses shape and form because all these new designs are just less detailed, less interesting, just boring all around.\r\n\r\nNew Yorick looks like generic buff executioner dude, ONLY WOW HE HAS A SHOVEL WHACKY!!! \r\nOld Yorick was a gravedigger. He looked lonely, he looked tired but also determined in his own Yorick way. His entire design evoked something.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve given up on LoL&#039;s gameplay but why would you want to keep tearing down the cool stuff about the fantasy you&#039;ve created? It makes no sense to me at all.","replies":[]}
