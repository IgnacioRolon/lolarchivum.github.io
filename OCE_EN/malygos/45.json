That&#039;s a pretty word(s).&quot;\r\n &quot;Hmph. One step ahead of the spirit world.&quot;\r\n &quot;A wanderer isn&#039;t always lost in the spirit world.&quot;\r\n &quot;Just looking for a road home to the not-spirit world.&quot;\r\n &quot;Never could stay in one place because I&#039;m in the spirit world as well.&quot;\r\n &quot;I will follow this spirit blade until the end.&quot;\r\n &quot;Honor is in the heart, not the spirit world.&quot;\r\n &quot;I will not forget who I am which is difficult because I am an enigma or something.&quot;\r\n &quot;This story is not yet finished, read chapter 2, in the spirit world.&quot;\r\n &quot;Is a spirit&#039;s only purpose to fall?&quot;\r\n &quot;Hmph... dying&#039;s the easy part just you wait until you wake up in the spirit world.&quot;\r\n\r\nAttacking\r\n &quot;People keep running into my [spirit] blade.&quot;\r\n &quot;I&#039;ll give you the easy way out (it&#039;s in the spirit world).&quot;\r\n &quot;No cure for fools in the spirit world.&quot;\r\n &quot;Kill me? You can try but I&#039;ll just go to the spirit world.&quot;\r\n &quot;It&#039;s just spirit world. Nothing serious.&quot;\r\n &quot;Make it spirit blade.&quot;\r\n &quot;Don&#039;t start what I&#039;ll finish in the spirit world.&quot;\r\n &quot;At peace with yourself? You will be in the spirit world.&quot;\r\n &quot;Some things never dull like my spirit blade.&quot;\r\n &quot;Some mistakes you can&#039;t make twice because it&#039;s actually impossible in the spirit world.&quot;\r\n &quot;I will not die. Ever. Really, I just got buffed to godlike status.&quot;\r\n &quot;No more running to the spirit world.&quot;\r\n &quot;I alone decide my fate using the spirit world.&quot;\r\n &quot;One spirit blade, one purpose.&quot;\r\n &quot;It is not yet time to die I used my spirit clock.&quot;\r\n\r\n(I&#039;m applying to work for Riot&#039;s writing team wish me luck)","replies":[]}
