By the looks of it we&#039;ll resign ourselves to casual heroic runs until Legion. However there&#039;s a chance that mightn&#039;t even work out. I&#039;ve been asking a bunch of friends if they were interested in playing WoW in a casual guild, and by the looks of it I might be able to put together a pretty decent roster. \r\n\r\nThere&#039;s a handful of GDers who&#039;ve told me they&#039;d be interested so I figured I may as well ask the rest of you.","replies":[]}
