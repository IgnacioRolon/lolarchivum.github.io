It&#039;s worded so awkwardly I can&#039;t help but feel the gist of it was &quot;play up the fantasy aspect&quot;, but whatever it&#039;s basically a blurb so I&#039;ll ignore that for now.\n\nThe imagery is strong, and for the most part I really liked that. The story nods were a bit forceful at times, but all in all eh, Riot&#039;s trying to tell a story in a fairly concise manner and that was a good note to start on. \n\nI&#039;m not so sure I&#039;m into the whole magical mountain deal, especially in the way it was presented it took away a lot of the mystery it had before (because why would a regular old mountain be so special?). \n\n\nPart 2: Pantheon\n\nI&#039;m going to start each character bit with what I liked about their old lore, so I have something more to mention when I comment on the new stuff.\n\nPantheon&#039;s old lore: He&#039;s great at fighting and he wants to represent his tribe in the institute of war. He has a fancy spear, but not much is known about it other than it&#039;s a relic weapon. What is a relic weapon in Runeterra? Who knows. It&#039;s just a name tossed about but one would assume it&#039;s pretty strong.\n\nI like it. It&#039;s simple. He is what he is, and having simple characters like this are just as important in keeping the flavour of the world intact as more detailed characters are.\n\nNew lore: He&#039;s been blessed by a godlike being to become an inhuman war machine. He has a fairly typical history of fantasy protagonists, none of which matters because the very core of his being was seared away in favour of this godlike being. \n\nI can&#039;t help but wonder what exactly was the point of telling Atreus&#039;s story. \nThe barbarians failing to kill Atreus and Pylus and simply vanishing is such an odd and awkward plot device, like the writers couldn&#039;t find a way to get Atreus to care about how the Solari function so they just chucked them down this path and figured yeah sure.\nAlso an axe to the chest? Then this kid stands up and helps carry his friend home for 3 days? \nIt doesn&#039;t explain where the axe hit, the chest is a pretty broad area. Shattered ribs, cloven sternum or right in the guts? At this point in time Atreus is just a training student, the journey is skipped past so quickly even though without a doubt that&#039;s the part of the story that needs the most explaining. \nOh and then there&#039;s even mention of the dumb hero-pose landing when Pantheon drops in from the sky.\n\nThe spear: uhh? This told me nothing about the spear itself... ohhhh right it was using the name of the weapon as Pantheon&#039;s title because even though Pantheon was straight up introduced as a godlike being without mercy they need to flaunt it. Pantheon is just an anime character. It was a step down in quality from the previous segment. Even though it was clearly Pantheon from the getgo, whoever wrote it insisted on dubbing him &quot;the warrior&quot; which made it awkward to read. \n\nI can&#039;t help but feel the telling of Atreus&#039;s story was simply so Riot could pull the generic plot device of &quot;but his humanity is still alive somewhere within this celestial war machine&quot; later down the line. \n\nTldr: Pantheon does not survive my initial statement.\nAnime: 1\nLeague of Legends: 0\n\n\nPart 3: Leona\n\nOriginally, Leona had the most anime of the three. She was blessed with extreme powers only realised in the nick of time. Her training was a big ??? mystery and there was no real mention of how she developed her specific blend of humanity despite being raised along the Rakkor where murdering your friends to prove you were a big boy is normal.\n\nOld lore: She didn&#039;t like fighting despite being a not-Spartan. She was friends with old Pantheon as kids, which wasn&#039;t entirely touched upon but I believe this a more interesting friendship than the rivalry with Pantheon based on ideals. Her judgement further colours her character, and provides a hell of a lot more insight into who the Rakkor were and why they were so dangerous (which was lacking from Pantheon&#039;s new story, but we&#039;ll see since Leona and Diana are still left).\n\nNew lore: The skin shimmering and glowing eyes have already destroyed her aesthetic for me. I really hope they never add that in game. \nI want to pause and note the contradiction I&#039;m feeling in the middle of reading this. If the Rakkor are the tribe of the last sun who must protect the sun from a big unknown catastrophe, why are they so afraid of these barbarians? Why was the order given to back up and turtle against a small barbarian attack, when they could lose more individuals to them instead of crushing them in force?\nShe learned to be a master fighter as soon as she could walk? HEREWEGOOOOOOOOOOO. \nWhy does it just so happen to be Atreus who notices this? It could&#039;ve been anyone else, hell even Molik from her old judgement would have been perfect. It would&#039;ve opened the door for more personal discovery about the Rakkor tribe. Instead we have a very insular viewpoint.\nOh look, a prophecy. \nAaaand same thing as Atreus, gone and deleted in favour of this celestial being. Why new-Leona has to find Diana is an interesting mystery at least. It could be as Diana said, the sun and moon may not be enemies after all. Or perhaps Diana was lying and new-Leona knows for certain she needs to be stopped.\n\nThe Light Bringer: This is much better than Pantheon&#039;s spear segment. It flowed very well, but felt a tad overwritten at some points (too explainy for some things). It did however, make Leona even more anime, which is you know. A damn shame.\nShe once again seems the most anime of the lot of them, but really they&#039;ve all been scaled way up.\n\nAn interesting story doesn&#039;t have to have colossal figures bashing against each other. Quite the opposite really.\nAnime: 2\nLeague of Legends: 0\n\n\nPart 4: Diana\n\nOld Diana&#039;s lore was a very strong continuation from old Leona&#039;s. I really liked it, Leona&#039;s story really opened the door for that kind of development and the pair worked to spawn interest between them. I want to note, this interest is bathed in mystery and lack of detail. Essentially a grey space for people to think on. \n\nOld lore: Diana saw through the Solari posturing. She sought truth, she found truth and was branded a heretic. By the light of the moon she worshipped, she struck down the heart of the Solari. \n\nNew lore: I cringed as soon as I read the quote at the top of her page. What does that even mean? It&#039;s Yasuo tier on the &quot;sounds cool and edgy but really dumb&quot; scale. Anyways, her new story pretty much follows her old story fairly closely. The only main differences are a bit of her backstory (which is minus points for orphan, sorry Riot but that&#039;s just how it works), and the peak. \nIn a book, or anything more expansive than this the appearance of this old lady climbing the mountain could have been portrayed better as a vision of her determination, or maybe it was the moon&#039;s guidance personified. Who knows, given the brevity of her story it&#039;s very pointless and odd.\n\nI probably like this one the best, simply because for the most part it kept it focused on Diana&#039;s discovery WHICH ACTUALLY MATTERS BECAUSE SHE WASN&#039;T DELETED FOR A GOD. SHE SIMPLY BECAME ENCHANTED WITH ONE, WHICH IS STILL KIND OF EHH BUT IT&#039;S A HELL OF A LOT BETTER THAN STRAIGHT UP BEING REMOVED. (Which is an interesting point of contrast to Leona and Pantheon, thanks moon).\n\nNight&#039;s Work: This is a thing, I guess. It didn&#039;t leave much of an impression on me. Diana&#039;s strong, sure. She&#039;s seeking more of her heritage, she can&#039;t entirely remember which is usually a messy way of running things. The writing was solid, a few sentences had me a bit confused regarding their structure (but that&#039;s a level of nitpicking I don&#039;t even want to explain).\n\nAll in all, I like Diana&#039;s new story, though it&#039;s still a detachment from her original which I think is better.\n\nFinal score:\nAnime: 2.1\nLeague of Legends: 0.9\n\nNow, for a rant.\n\nThese new stories are all incredibly grandiose compared to the previous characters. Riot, you have over 100 champions. You cannot realistically make each and every story highly strung tension without introduce an absurd amount of fantasy clutter into your world. The more disparity there is between characters when compared, the less functional your world becomes (because let&#039;s be real here, who from Bilgewater would be capable of stopping Pantheon mowing through the entire town if somehow some way it came to that).\n\nThere&#039;s also something very important I want to touch on, and this really really really REALLY impacts the sense of world.\nNONE OF THESE STORIES EXPLAIN THE RAKKOR.\nThey didn&#039;t have much detail before, but now they have even less. The new Rakkor are a mess of political, religious and military drama which doesn&#039;t tie together well. The old Rakkor were given moments of personal development, sort of like eyes-on-the-ground instead of watching the League of Legends Anime. \nMolik&#039;s stark comparison in Leona&#039;s old judgement (which is no longer canon) is probably the best example. I&#039;ll copy paste it here for those who haven&#039;t seen it. (This takes place in a 1v1 to the death for the sake of becoming recognised as a warrior of the Rakkor)\n\n&gt; She looked at Molik. His gaze was steel. In any other place or time, he would be wearing a goofy smile and confiding in Leona his passion for woodworking. His skill with a carving knife was enviable, though it didn&#039;t translate at all to the sword. Now, he was a warrior of the Rakkor &ndash; emotionless and unmerciful.\n\nRIOT, IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A STRONG COHERENT AND CONSISTENT WORLD, THE PEOPLE ARE THE ONES THAT MATTER THE MOST. NOT YOUR ANIME CHARACTERS. THE POPULATIONS. THEY MATTER. WHO ARE THEY? HOW DO THEY THINK? WHAT ARE THEIR CULTURAL DIFFERENCES?\nLook to any major fantasy world, and you&#039;ll see how clear that is. At the head of the culture, you can have your anime characters, but if they&#039;re not supported by a history of who they represent most of what they do is incredibly easy to pass off and just say &quot;eh, that was cool.&quot;\nTake Thrall and Garrosh from Warcraft as an example. If you removed the history of the orcs, and focused solely on the conflict between the two characters it&#039;s a much more boring story than what it was.\nThis is where Diana&#039;s Lunari vs Solari stuff really sets in strong. I don&#039;t mention Leona because she barely got much of a say in the development of that tension, and instead she represents the Solari brainwashing. But that&#039;s room for future development at least.\n\nYes, having paragons of certain themes from their culture can be interesting, but it should not take precedence over developing the people and the culture. \n\nWalking away from this update, I have taken very little from it. I know the stories of two dead and irrelevant characters, because they were replaced by gods. I know of tension between the Solari and Lunari. And I know Leona&#039;s fkn stupid because she can blast down 50 men using the sun&#039;s fury but she won&#039;t even go for a walk to clean up a small band of barbarians which are picking off her people, who should have bigger things to worry about than rogue barbarians.\n\nIt&#039;s a mess.\nTaking the time to detail events is like exposing your neck, it needs to answer more than it asks which I feel did not happen here.\n\nI will mention the quality again, because for the most part it was well written and engaging. I do wish we&#039;d get more insight instead of raw exposition. Bring back the judgements.\nBring back the journal of justice.\n\nLet us see through the eyes of the people.","replies":[]}
