The way things were filmed could&#039;ve been done a lot better, especially the last scene in the episode. It didn&#039;t feel right because without the first person narration Ellie&#039;s actions seemed way out of character.\r\n\r\nPersonalities were really weirdly set up, relationships are already being hinted at that shouldn&#039;t exist until much later. Acting cast is pretty much what I expected from ABC3, decent enough but rough around the edges. \r\n\r\nFirst episode 4/10, so it&#039;s watchable but nothing fantastic yet. I have hope, it probably won&#039;t be great but it&#039;ll be worthy nostalgia?\r\n\r\nif you want to watch it in potato quality:\r\nhttp://iview.abc.net.au/programs/tomorrow-when-the-war-began/CH1501H001S00#playing","replies":[]}
