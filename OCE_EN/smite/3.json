Last semester we had a very successful team make it to the top 16 stage of the OCC and this semester we&#039;re looking to go even further!\r\n\r\nI highly recommend any Otago students to sign up and participate in this excellent competition. I will do my very best to make sure that you have a way to participate even if you are a single summoner looking for a team.\r\n\r\nFirst up find our facebook group here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1389690251332401/\r\n\r\nOnce you&#039;ve joined up there you can find discussions from other members and hopefully find like minded players for a team.\r\n\r\nNext up I&#039;ll be creating a &quot;solo queue&quot; roster for anyone to find a team easily. Simply sign up and I&#039;ll either create a team of 5 from the roster or place you into a team that is only looking for one or two more members. To do this you&#039;ll need to be part of the facebook group as that is where I do most of my organisation.\r\n\r\nSo get your flatties together and get ready to take Otago to the finals in Sydney!","replies":[{"poster":"Smite","date":"2015-07-24T01:30:32.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man here is the sign up page for the competition itself\n\nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/ouc-team-registration","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spaghini","date":"2015-07-23T20:46:14.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still can't find a page where we actually sign up for the competition, has anyone organised one yet?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Struggle","date":"2015-07-21T23:28:40.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sweet joined it this morning","replies":[]},{"poster":"Paarthurnax","date":"2015-07-21T07:59:05.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Scarfies!","replies":[]}]}
