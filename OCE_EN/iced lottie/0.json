This can sometimes lead to them getting matched with lower level players.\n\nYou also have to take into consideration that these players might be duo with a friend that is lower level, or rank, and that could result in the match.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Amaryliss","date":"2017-03-28T05:39:53.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now if oce actually had normals draft we could relate..xD\n\nAs unfair as it may feel, normals mmr and ranked mmr are completely separate, so diamonds who have barely played any norms can easily get matched with bronze/silver who have played a lot of norms. If you really want to have an evenly matched game i'd suggest Ranked Solo/Duo, apart from that not much you can do about matchmaking :/","replies":[{"poster":"nedo007","date":"2017-05-14T06:17:22.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is not that higher elo players get matched with lower elo players, the real problem is when all the high elo players are in the same team vs a lower elo team, as is op's case(and mine for the most part).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Iced Lottie","date":"2017-03-29T05:20:00.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I meant to post this on NA boards, lol. \n\nAnd yeah, it's not always bad going against them as it is does help learn, but it's still not fun when majority of the games played end up being losses because of it. \n\nOCE not having normal draft is a big part of the reason why I moved to NA.

Any time I get to play with or against a higher ranked player I learn something. In normal games that is what it is all about (for me at least).\n\nIf I can outsmart a Diamond or Platinum player for even one instance of a whole game I feel like I have achieved something.\nI watch what they do and how they play which gives me knowledge on how to become a better player myself, so I welcome the challenge.\n\nI guess everybody sees things differently.","replies":[]}]}
