Their actual MMRs are probably a lot closer to Platinum 5.\n\nAlso it seems like they might be smurfing to me (which would explain the unusual MMRs).  78%, 64% and 57% winrates are a pretty good indicator of that.\n\n__*\n\n_So was this match fair?_\n\n+ Well **Lux**, **Taric** and **Pantheon** were all in Dynamic Queue together... and there's definitely something to be said about how fair DQ is on the solo player.\n\n But apart from that, it's absolutely fair in the sense that you were meaning. Your team had a 50% chance of winning and everyone's skill was pretty even.","replies":[{"poster":"WeaponizedAutizm","date":"2016-10-01T20:05:01.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How can you tell they were in queue together?

Those 3 had 8 - 15 shared games together if I remember correctly, so with that we can made an educated guess that they were dynamic queued for this game too.\n\nI won't share any of the OP.GG accounts here to respect this guy's privacy. But if you do some google-fu with what you can see of **Lux**'s name, then should be able to find their accounts fairly easily :)","replies":[{"poster":"WeaponizedAutizm","date":"2016-10-01T21:15:34.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I always check the 'Recently Played With' when I scoping out possible premades in my games.
