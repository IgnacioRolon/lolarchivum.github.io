The dynamic queue is great for solo/duo, however ...\r\nMany of us are hating that queuing up as 5, in a team, affects your solo ranking rather than the team ranking.\r\nThis was better the way it was before, and I do not like that team ranks have gone.\r\nPlease bring back ranked teams - even if it uses the same queuing system, but recognises &quot;hey, this is a team of 5 with team name XXXX&quot; - lets affect their team rank instead&quot;.\r\nWho agrees?\r\nThanks.\r\nRegards,\r\nNick","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-06T12:10:40.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe they have plans of this nature after solo queue rolls out. It may be a while before any info comes out though. If they intended to remove teams entirely they would have done so when they released the new queue.

Something about having fun whilst also being strategic with friends really sat well with me.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-02-06T23:54:17.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know, I wouldn't mind the new Dynamic Queue if only they removed 4-man.
