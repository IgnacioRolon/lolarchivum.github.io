A coach has to understand each and every single one of his players in order to develop synergy, teamwork, and overall team strategy for his team. To do this he must analyze every single scrim his team plays as well as analyzing players individually in terms of skill and playstyle. He also has to study other teams, their players, their strategies, their individual skills. He has to understand the game at a very high level (this is why you see many retired pro players become coaches because they are so experienced and knowledgeable in the game) and use his knowledge on the game to assist his players. He also has to make sure each player is emotionally intact (however this is actually proving difficult for most coaches, hence why CLG is looking into a sports psychologist) and make sure all his players are facing their troubles/problems immediately so there are no long term bad habits or problems. Coaches DO ALOT and right now they are ESSENTIAL to a teams success.\n\n**_Requirements:_**\n1.  Come to voice chat 10 minutes before Scrims/Tournament to discuss Strategy and team comps, that you would like players to play.\n2.
