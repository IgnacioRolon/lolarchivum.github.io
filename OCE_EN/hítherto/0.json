{"poster":"Hítherto","date":"2017-01-20T12:04:29.670+0000","title":"Bans out the wazoo","subforum":"Player Behaviour","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Essentially, I&#039;ve been very inflammatory in chat communications for a few months, and have gotten on a succession of accounts a variety of chat restrictions and bans. \n\nOn my latest, H&iacute;therto, I just got finished off a 25 game restriction. However, the one game I play once it lifts, wherein I say things to an enemy like, &quot;Rat turds could be doing what you&#039;re doing.&quot;, and related things, I get a 14 day suspension. \n\nNow, I agree that some of the things I have said prior, in fact maybe most of them, have been 100% fairly deserving of the punishments I&#039;ve received. I said some atrocious shit to some people, that having looked through the logs displayed have made me want to punch myself in the face. And those accounts I said those atrocious things on, yeah, lock them up and throw away the key. \n\nHowever, this latest suspension I wish to contest. I had one game, where I talked smack to some people, one guy in particular named **name removed** who I have had much history with. That might be required context for some of my words. I swore a little bit, even ruminated on the fact that a little swearing gets you banned, and bang, 14 day suspension. If you wish to read the log, it will be after the final paragraph.\n\nI would like some second opinion. I would like a person, not an automated system, to tell me that what I said in this particular game was worthy of a further punishment. I am fully aware that I deserved the chat restrictions I got. However, if you wish to delve even into my prior logs and look at the sorts of things I said there, and what I said here, you will find that I am decidedly reformed. I am sick and tired of saying a few mean things and mean words to people and getting account after account banned. \n\nThank you for having read all of this.\n\nGame 1\nH&iacute;therto: hello akali\nH&iacute;therto: what&#039;s good my dude\nH&iacute;therto: he&#039;s baller as fuck\nH&iacute;therto: say that again in 20 minutes\nH&iacute;therto: ty\nH&iacute;therto: very good bard thanks\nH&iacute;therto: why %%%%\nH&iacute;therto: no dramas dude\nH&iacute;therto: hey, i main him\nH&iacute;therto: ziggs isnt exactly the most non cancerous champ either\nH&iacute;therto: xd\nH&iacute;therto: where else would you gank in my position\nH&iacute;therto: botlane is doing fine\nH&iacute;therto: singed is singed\nH&iacute;therto: lul\nH&iacute;therto: the fuck do you think i&#039;ve been doing\nH&iacute;therto: im anglo %%%%\nH&iacute;therto: FYI\nH&iacute;therto: and you&#039;re trash\nH&iacute;therto: that isn&#039;t aids at all :^)\nH&iacute;therto: mate i have played so many games with you\nH&iacute;therto: you always feed\nH&iacute;therto: i remember several distinct instances where you were like 0/3 by 8 minutes and having a sook in fountain\nH&iacute;therto: so get fucked\nH&iacute;therto: yes you have, you haven&#039;t been looking very hard\nH&iacute;therto: yeah righto mate\nH&iacute;therto: lul\nH&iacute;therto: looks like you&#039;re gonna be shitting shoelaces\nH&iacute;therto: for a few days\nH&iacute;therto: foot in your mouth\nH&iacute;therto: OH MT GOD\nH&iacute;therto: the braincells you had to rub together there tryndamere\nH&iacute;therto: fuck the friction must have been hot on your fingers, are you alright?\nH&iacute;therto: go stick them up your dad&#039;s arse to cool them down mate\nH&iacute;therto: lol\nH&iacute;therto: get bent\nH&iacute;therto: why me, for talking shit?\nH&iacute;therto: grow some nuts you fuckwits\nH&iacute;therto: HE CALLED ME A FUCKWIT RITO WAHHHHHHH\nH&iacute;therto: DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT HE&#039;S A FUCKING SCOURGE AND A MENACE TO THIS GAME\nH&iacute;therto: noice\nH&iacute;therto: noice\nH&iacute;therto: i feel like you haven&#039;t muted me\nH&iacute;therto: what&#039;s your problem mate\nH&iacute;therto: fuck yeah, yi and tryndamere?\nH&iacute;therto: oowee, we&#039;re playing some real masters of the game\nH&iacute;therto: for fucking real?\nH&iacute;therto: tryndamere you&#039;re playing the most mindless shit in existence\nH&iacute;therto: i mean for all i know it could already have happened but a legit pile of rat turds could do what you&#039;re doing\nH&iacute;therto: how about you go swap yourself with a pile of rat turds and we&#039;ll see if your performance falters for it\nH&iacute;therto: i fucking bet it won&#039;t\nH&iacute;therto: poofter lul\nH&iacute;therto: can you say, FUCKING FUCKWIT, anybody?\nH&iacute;therto: niiiice\nH&iacute;therto: i don&#039;t reckon\nH&iacute;therto: bye\nH&iacute;therto: i do love the fact that you have three melee hypercarries\nH&iacute;therto: nice win m8\nH&iacute;therto: gg %%%Got yas","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2017-01-21T03:09:22.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*[ I edited out the name as we have a no naming and shaming rule on the boards](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules)\n\nWell my buddy, looks like you deserved your punishment fair and square. \n\nThe first hint should be:\n> Essentially, I've been very inflammatory in chat communications for a few months, and have gotten on a succession of accounts a variety of chat restrictions and bans.\n\nor maybe this:\n\n>  I am sick and tired of saying a few mean things and mean words to people and getting account after account banned.\n\n\nIt looks to me like you are a chronic toxin.** YOU ARE GETTING CONSTANTLY PUNISHED FOR A REASON**. \n\n Instead of jumping straight back on the bandwagon and playing more games just to be a salty noodle, you should actually take a second to reflect on your actions. It doesn't matter if these reports are going through a person or the instant feedback system, the problem is obviously you. \n\n>However, this latest suspension I wish to contest. I had one game, where I talked smack to some people, one guy in particular named name removed who I have had much history with.\n\nHeres a tip: *If you wish to talk smack and not get banned, do it in the safety of team chat (not /all chat) with a group of buddies who don't mind a bit of \"banter\". If you are talking smack in a team full of randoms or in /all chat, people are going to report you because they simply don't want their game ruined by your inability to control your typing outrage.* \n\n____\n\n#Onto your chat log\n\n\n>Hítherto: FYI\nHítherto: and you're trash\nHítherto: that isn't aids at all :^)\nHítherto: mate i have played so many games with you\nHítherto: you always feed\nHítherto: i remember several distinct instances where you were like 0/3 by 8 minutes and having a sook in fountain\nHítherto: so get fucked\n\nLooks like you got some negative attitude there pal, and possibly even starting to decide not to help your team ([both are punishable offences](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player)). \n\n\n>Hítherto: looks like you're gonna be shitting shoelaces\nHítherto: for a few days\nHítherto: foot in your mouth\nHítherto: OH MT GOD\nHítherto: the braincells you had to rub together there tryndamere\nHítherto: fuck the friction must have been hot on your fingers, are you alright?\nHítherto: go stick them up your dad's arse to cool them down mate\n\nOh look, still being a jerk.  I'm sure you actually don't need someone to tell you that what you're doing is wrong. \n\n>Hítherto: tryndamere you're playing the most mindless shit in existence\nHítherto: i mean for all i know it could already have happened but a legit pile of rat turds could do what you're doing\nHítherto: how about you go swap yourself with a pile of rat turds and we'll see if your performance falters for it\n\n\"Talking smack\" no matter how therapeutic it may be for you, can easily ruin someone else's game. You have legit 0 reason to be saying this kind of ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ to a teammate. \n\nDoes it serve a purpose? Is it going to help the teams situation?\n No. \nthen don't ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ say it. \n\n>Hítherto: gg %%%Got yas\n\nIt doesn't matter who you \"have history with\" or who started BM. It doesn't matter if your team is absolute and utter trash. There is no need for any of this behaviour in the game. No homophobic slurs. This is insta permaban worthy IMO. \n\n___\n\n\n>However, if you wish to delve even into my prior logs and look at the sorts of things I said there, and what I said here, you will find that I am decidedly reformed.\n\nEven if what you were saying before was worse than this, you are the type of player that seriously needs to look into their behaviour and perhaps come up with some coping strategies so you aren't ruining the game for other players. \nPerhaps try saying your rage out loud rather than typing it. That way nobody on your team has to hear your ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥.","replies":[{"poster":"Hítherto","date":"2017-01-21T07:03:04.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You saw his name though right?
