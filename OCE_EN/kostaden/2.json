Eventually, he got Bronze 3 and I got placed in Bronze 5. Afterwards, I set a goal to myself to get myself out of Bronze and to Silver!\r\nAt the start of the year and in S4 AND S5 I used to main mid. Bu this year (after the promotional games) I realised that I&#039;m not the best at mid and that I should try something else. So I took up ADC and after a lot of grinding and learning new champions I achieved my goal of getting to Silver. It was a very fun and exciting time for me because it was my first time getting to Silver. Currently I main Vayne, Lucian, Twitch (and I&#039;m trying to learn Draven). \r\n\r\nNow once I got to Silver, I thought to myself, I can do better than this, and so I set myself another goal to get to Gold so I can also receive the Victorious skin!\r\n\r\nGetting to Silver was easy and I thought getting to Gold would be easier... but it turns out... it wasn&#039;t.....\r\n\r\nAfter getting to Silver 2 and having great games solo and dynamic I started dropping...\r\n\r\nAnd when I mean dropping I mean bad dropping... I dropped to S4 in 1 month while it took me only a month to get to silver in the first place.\r\n\r\nFor the past 3-5 months, I&#039;ve been trying to get back to normal. I reckon my gameplay is good but I can definitely improve it. \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been trying my best but I can&#039;t get over 80lp in Silver 4!\r\n\r\nCan anyone please help me or give me some tips on how to get to gold until the end of the season?\r\n\r\nPlease, I need your help!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nkostaden","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-09-19T08:31:10.592+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd recommend checking out the pinned posts by Yaiamone at the top of [Gameplay and Strategy](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy).

Pair up with some mates that are of equal skill or higher and strut yourself into gold. Because honestly no matter how good you play and try and carry chances are there will be at least one boosted animal on your team who is feeding the enemy just as hard.\n\nSure that may sound brutal but it's 100% the truth. It's pure luck who you get on your team in soloq and whether or not they feel like 1st time picking a champ in ranked for a bit of fun or they are just boosted trash. No one listens to any advice you may give or listen to pings... nothing. Everyone at that elo (and well above) are in their own little world doing there own little thing and screw whoever tries to tell them differently. It's what makes this game so frustrating.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glow","date":"2016-09-19T20:58:42.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, you want to improve which is the first main step to climbing :) I would highly recommend getting a program that records your games so that you can watch them back afterwards. Try identifying mistakes you make, especially in games that you're not sure how you lost. Look for problems in your gameplay (do you always get caught out by not warding? Are you not going for objectives after kills?) and try to adjust those. More than anything though, just keep playing games to improve, a lot of it is a mileage thing.
