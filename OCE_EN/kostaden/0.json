Would you still build this Verse an Ahri mid lane and a Elise Jungle?

Let me rephrase it.\n\nIf you are playing as Nocturne and your opponents are Ahri and Elise, would you still use the same build for Noc (eg{{item:3710}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3074}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3262}} {{item:3072}} )\n\nAlso, dont go and watch videos and assume that the build the person suggests or uses is always the correct build. You will need to build according to the game, your team, and your opponents, not a per-defined build you saw someone use. Can i just get an indication of how old you are so i can tailor my response a bit better?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Matutinus","date":"2014-12-20T04:42:59.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do not need that much damage/lifesteal with no tank stats on an initiator like noct, thats why you'd be dying so much. you can have 100% lifesteal, but if you have no health/resistances you are going to die. something like: {{item:3710}}, {{item:3153}}, {{item:3262}}, {{item:3143}}, {{item:3065}} ,{{item:3022}} or{{item:3110}} or{{item:3083}}.

Randuins. \nEnemy TeamComp relies on picks, Ahri/Scarner/Lux, High-Burst Combo-Dependent APs Le Blanc/Fizz/Syndra? Banshees. \n\n{{item:3026}} Since your gonna Dive in 90% of the time, your gonna get focused. Give them the ultimatum, blow everything including cc, sums etc. on the offtank GA Noc, risking losing their cc for the rest of your team, only for you to come back? Or completely ignore you and engage your team half-assed as they get caught up in the SoloQ confusion that is effective teamfighting, leaving the (hopefully) squishy carry to deal with you themselves(or with someone wasting cc on you).\n\n{{item:3035}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3139}}{{item:3050}} \nThese are just some situational items. If their damage dealers have opt in for some Armour to deal with your damage, The Last Whisper should negate a considerable portion of their survivability while still giving you a bit more damage.\n\nThe Trinity Force. AKA the Key to the Gates. If your team is too incompetent to formulate even a basic 2v1 let alone a teamfight, your best bet is to use them as a distraction while you managed to backdoor. Because a majority of your spells arnt target only, you can proc your Tri-Force more often to destroy towers quicker. It also givs you a bit of everything, from AD and AP, HP and Mana, MoveSpeed and Crit Chance, Tri-force is really good on Noc ( or any AD with decent splitpush and ability to proc Tri-Force)\n\nLast of all, Sell Merc Scimmy 20K. RS jokes aside, Scimmy is perfect for Noc to stick to those Pesky CC Bots that wont let you stick on them. If you didnt go the Banshees route and your CDR isnt enough to to have your own sheild up reliably, Merc Scimmy gives you one last chance to get that final AA off to KS. Since there is only a few slightly-viable items with CDR for Noc (Youmoos/Frozen Heart/Visage/Locket) which you may not be running, having the ability to remove ALL Debuffs (except Knock Ups/Backs) and Added movespeed, this allows you to be at peak performance while still maintaining the lock down on the person you dived. \n\nOther than Bork/Hydra/BT i was looking something that still gave him tanky stats. Thats when i ran across Good ol' Starks AKA Zeke's Herald. Now this item is rarely seen and is VERY off-meta BUT it does provide Noc A LOT of benefits. For starters, More HP, not much but for the items cost its justified. Another thing Noc Lacks in his main build is CDR. With 20% CDR, and at such a low cost compared to a lot of other items you could buy for its stats, Zeke's is looking good for Noc. But it gets better. Zeke's gives an Aura of 20+ AD to all Nearby Champs including Noc. While not being a BT, it still gives some Damage for your spells to scale off. But during teamfights where Noc Thrives, giving 20+ AD to all your Teammates means a total of 100+ AD Overall. Now last but not least, the Aura Lifesteal it gives. If your lacking a Bork due to a Double AP comp, Zekes gives just as much Lifesteal as Bork (10%), not only to you, but your entire team (within 1100 range). This gives you the ability to sustain in teamfights which is only really given with Bork or Hydra/BT with Bork being the most useful due to the Attack Speed and Sticking potential. I would go out on the record here and say, if your against a Double or Triple AP comp and Maw and Banshees/Visage is just not cutting it in terms of CDR and Soaking up AP Damage, Zekes will allow you to hit CDR Cap, meaning more defensive spells and more sticking potential. It also allows for you to sustain through some of the periodic AP damage thats coming your way meaning being tanky enough to out live the enemy. Not to mention this helps your whole team with the Aura.\n\n{{item:3110}} One of the reasons i havnt mentioned Frozen Heart is that despite its nice Armour and CDR, without Health, Noc is useless when diving. FHs armour has to complement HP and if you have neglected HP you arnt going to get as much survivability out of FH. Randuins gives 70 Armour and 500 HP which is far more effective than 100Armour and base HP. Another thing about knock is that his Mana costs are relatively Low compared to a lot of other junglers. Because he gets a lot of innate AttaskSpeed from his Passives, there is no need to spam spells to get though the jungle, which means the CDR and Mana arnt too effective on him. Non the less, Mana , CDR and Armour are all still good on Noc.\n\n{{item:3110}} vs {{item:3143}} in terms of pure tanking AD.\nSo i crunched some numbers (The Stat Unit im doing is now getting some use) about Armour vs HP+Armour.\nSince i CBF Formatting it onto a post im just gonna add it to the attachments(2 Posts down Soz). But essentially, if you want to take as many hits as possible from an AD champ, Randuins is more effective than Frozen Heart in damage mitigation and surviving.\n\n\nOr, if your Team Needs a Damage Dealer and You CBF about dying and know your team can finish the game without you, go the Glass Cannon Crit Noc Build.\n{{item:3074}}{{item:3087}}{{item:3142}}{{item:3026}}{{item:3031}}{{item:3035}} \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"kostaden","date":"2014-12-20T23:35:40.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"KK man thanks you guys have helped me a lot I'll try everything.\n\nCheers","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2014-12-20T12:37:24.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I couldnt edit in an attachment so i had to make a double post.
