Whenever you get a kill try to get an objective as well (e.g. a dragon, a tower, or at least getting more vision?)\n\nAlso in your last 20 ranked games you have 10 different champions. Try to play 1 or 2 per lane. IMHO if you need to choose between playing 10 champions decently and only 2 perfectly go with the latter.\n\nYour damage and wards count seems good.\n\nYour kill participation wobble from 21%-77%. I'm just guessing but unless you're split pushing this could mean you're not grouping enough?\n\nTake what I said with a grain of salt as I haven't watched you playing and I'm just guessing for what I can see at op.gg\n\nGood luck and hope you can climb out of bronze soon!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Corvo Attano","date":"2018-12-02T07:38:46.028+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your KDAs seem fine so unless you can specify for me I'd assume your problem is the inability to play for objectives and therefore, closeout games. Rather than look at kills as a goal, look at them as an opportunity to achieve objectives and trust me- learn to shotcall, it helps immensely.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-12-03T10:49:12.318+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Git gud, or don't bother, once you're in bronze, or what will soon be iron, you're stuck there, good luck leaving","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chvrche5","date":"2018-12-04T11:28:25.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, I just ran through your match history with the blitz desktop app. Firstly, you have piss poor vision score even in games which you are winning. Buy control wards and make sure you are using the free trinkets you get.\n\nBut the most important reason I think you're not climbing is because you play too many champions in ranked. You've got 25+ champions which you've got below 50% win rate on, but only 4 which you've got higher than 50% win rate on. You can only expect to start climbing when you're winning more than 50% of your games. So there's no reason to disadvantage yourself by playing a champion you're inexperienced with. Unless off course you're playing them because you want to learn the champion. But in that case do not expect to climb.\n\nThe 4 champions you seem to be doing well on are Lux, Tham Kench and Blitzcrank. Also Nasus but you've only played 5 games so it's hard to say. You've won all your last 6 games on Lux so maybe that's a sign you should be playing her more. Don't throw away wins because you played Jhin for example. You've got 20% win rate on him despite playing him for 20 games.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's up to you how you want to approach ranked. You can keep playing Jhin and improve on him, but at the same time expect your climb to be slow. Or you could play more Lux and climb faster. I chose to just main the support role and peaked in platnium, whereas if I was playing an adc, I would probably be low gold.\n\nHope this helps. Good luck!","replies":[]}]}
