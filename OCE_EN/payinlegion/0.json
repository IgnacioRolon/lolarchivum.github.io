As the fighting continues, I am still able to see the changes in health and resources, as damage is being dealt and spells are being cast. In this time, I am able to make movement commands and cast spells which are registered in the actual game, however not on my screen. If I am killed (which is likely when this problem occurs), my health will be displayed as zero, yet my champion will remain standing and i will not see the death screen until the lag stops, which is generally about 20 ~ 45 seconds later. The levels of ping which are registered on my screen are generally not anything different to the average levels which i experience (between 60 and 70).\r\nplease if someone can help and suggest what may be wrong, i don&#039;t want to cause more peeps to lose :( &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-02T02:02:53.987+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey payinlegion,\n\nThis sounds like packet loss, so first I'd suggest hard resetting your modem and router by unplugging them for 5 minutes. If it's packet loss you're getting and it doesn't go away, you may need to contact your ISP for help. You can run a [tracert described here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs) to check where your lag is starting, and you can run the command below to ping the last hop before the OCE server and constantly test your ping, or test your connection in a Custom match;\n\n> ping 165.228.9.78 -t\n\nFollow the steps on the [Connection Troubleshooting Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to make sure your connection is set up properly.

If you don't know, packet loss is simply when some of the data is lost on the way. For general internet usage you may not notice it, but in a game like League it's pretty obvious when you can't do anything and things are jumping around on the screen.\n\nIf you haven't reset your modem and router yet, please do that. Run the traceroute again afterwards. If you are still experiencing the packet loss, please contact your ISP and let them know.

This curse occurs when black energy decides to live off the energy from your network. It has now taken over your network, however it is still disguising itself as your network.
