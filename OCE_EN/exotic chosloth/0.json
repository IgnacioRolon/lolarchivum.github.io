But tonight it wasn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the last of it&rdquo; the small yordle spoke softly &ldquo;this will be enough poison to last me a month&rdquo; the yordle mused. The sun gave the jungle its last glimpse of light before retreating behind the mountain. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t get back to the city now&rdquo; the yordle thought frustrated &ldquo;i&rsquo;ll have to stay here for the night&rdquo;. It was at that moment, the yordles stomach snarled at him with an insatiable hunger. The yordle made a small look at the lake. &ldquo;There must be fish in there&rdquo;.  How long was it? One hour? Two? Nothing would take the yordles bait. There was an island in the middle of the lake, &ldquo;was that always there&rdquo;? Maybe i&rsquo;ll be able to get more fish from there. Swimming was never a strong area with yordles but the unrelenting call of the yordles belly was more than enough to encourage him to swim. The island always managed to stay meters away from the yordle. was he getting closer to the island, or farther away? Within inches of setting foot on the island, the yordle didn&rsquo;t feel like it was right, it was green, covered in some sort of algae. Lumps formed around the island and it had odd spikes shooting out of the top of it like trees. No, not trees, arrows. It had an otherworldly feel, like it was not meant to be and yet it was here. What was it? The yordle had little time to react as a green pillar erupted from the water. It bore a scythe of skin and bone. The pillar slammed down in the water sending the yordle spinning off towards the shore. Another pillar shot out of the water next to the other. Each slouching down as if they were too heavy to be supported. Next the tail. It flung from the water spraying water for kilometers, it was finned and barely adapted for life in the water. As if it evolved in a day. It was grotesque, it thrashed with pain? Or pleasure? Finally, the head. It was foul, almost every inch of it was covered in long gnashing teeth. Could it close its mouth? Would it want to? The creature held a large fish in its mouth, no matter how large the fish was, it was still dwarfed by the creature. The fish slipped and slid down the monster&#039;s throat. It mumbled with pleasure, and then pain. Its own skin looked like it was stretching getting ready to burst but it didn&rsquo;t. The beast grew, it was barely noticeable at first, but then it sprung like a frog growing more fins, more scales spreading down its horrible body. It pink eyes scrolled from left to right. It wasn&rsquo;t satisfied, it needed more. Would the beast ever be full? Then its eyes fixed on the little yordle, the creature growled in disgust. The creature pointed a long skinny claw it the yordle. &ldquo;Your souls will feed the void!&rdquo; it screeched. Void? What was this being? Why was it here? Before the yordle thought about it. He was swimming to shore. The creature gurgled with laughter. &ldquo;You shall not escape&rdquo;. The yordle reached the shore he glanced behind him, the creature had not moved. It wore a toothed grin that stretched his skin in places it was probably never been stretched before. The creature made a slow but steady advance towards the scout. As the waters got shallower, the yordle could see how great it was in size. The yordle smirked at the creature, &ldquo;were you always this fat, or did you work at it&rdquo;? The creature scowled with anger but then twisted his head back into a laugh. &ldquo;There will be no end to your suffering&rdquo; it spat. The yordle collected his blow darts and his poison and rushed into the jungle. His eyes darted to a bush that could keep him safe from the ominous pink eyes of the creature. One tree collapsed, then another, the jungle was being torn down for this being of pure horror. It looked out of place on land, it had feet that looked like they haven&#039;t touched the ground in ages. Was it ages? Or days? How could anyone tell how long this wretched thing has been on this planet? &ldquo;The creature swung its tail from side to side, sweeping through the tall grass. &ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo; the yordle heard himself say. The monster&#039;s head jerked around but it did not know where the voice had come from. &ldquo;Ahhh the tangled webs we weave.&rdquo; the creature slurred &ldquo;who is we?&rdquo; the yordle cursed himself for speaking. The creature&rsquo;s eyes darted from one bush to another but it had no clue where the yordle was. &ldquo;We will consume this world&rdquo; the creature grinned &ldquo;and you along with it&rdquo; a small dart shot out of the corner of the beast&rsquo;s eye. It pierced the monster&rsquo;s thick skin and blinded him. The creature spun around with rage but his vision was blurred and couldn&rsquo;t see anything. The scout fired another barrage of shots at the behemoth the monster turned with frustration and pain. &ldquo;There will be no end to your suffering!&rdquo; the being bellowed. It slammed it&rsquo;s foot on the ground and within seconds, spikes erected from the ground. The scout weaved around them and continued his attack. The creature&rsquo;s sight returned and screamed at the yordle. The sound shot through the yordle&rsquo;s ears and even made his skin feel pain. The creature advanced on the yordle, it extended its jaw and beared a mouth full of needle like teeth. &ldquo;Omnomnomnomnom&rdquo; the monster joked as he plucked the yordle out of the air. The small yordle looked minuscule compared to the shoggoth that grasped him in his claws. The yordle smirked and produced a mushroom from his backpack. The creature noticed and laughed &ldquo;to add flavor&rdquo; he spoke mockingly. Without hesitation, the yordle threw the mushroom towards the creatures face. The fungus exploded and the monster fell to the ground screaming. &ldquo;Size doesn&rsquo;t mean everything&rdquo; the yordle said triumphantly. The being stood up to attack when the sun returned from around the mountain. The creature frothed in pain and anguish. &ldquo;The daylight, it burns!&rdquo;, the monster fled back to the lake and dived down to the depths from which it originated from. The yordle looked in his backpack annoyed. &ldquo;All out of poison already&rdquo; he muttered. The yordle turned on his heels and went back to collecting poison. Then the little yordle heard a voice behind him. &ldquo;Change is good&rdquo;, the yordle sighed and reached for his blowgun.\r\n\r\n\r\nC: consume\r\nH: hunger\r\nO: ominous\r\nG: growing\r\nA: abomination\r\nT: twisted\r\nH: hatred","replies":[]}
