I main adc. I was gold 2 last season but i've moved from mid to adc to learn the role. Since about 3 days ago i've started actually winning again! I'm already in a ranked team that I play on tuesdays (plat/gold mostly)- but i would like very much to play adc (or mid if i must) in another ranked team to just get more experience. Last season i went from B5 to G2 in 3000 ranked games and this season S5 to S3 in about 200. PLayed about 60-70 ranked 5's games since last season.
