Plus this is oce incase you were wondering THERE IS NO SNOW\n\nThe game has been running for 6 years and there are two ultimate skins in the game, do the maths (You arent gunna get one every year)\n\nyou are moaning because you got rekt by a champ and riot dint nerf them immediatly after, join the club\n\nso some ppl got ranked up by pantheon and some didn't, no one got to challenger from b5 through use of pantheon in that patch \nso it wasnt freelo as you say then was it.\n\nno wood tier? im assuming you deal a lot with ppl who deserve to be there? or else you wouldn't mention it, this means you must be quite far down the scale then, and are butthurt because you arent challenger when you think you should be.\n\nat least they give you support, try vodafone or apple (and btw those arent a FREE TO PLAY game like this is)\n\nbundles are bait? the battlecast bundle had 7 skins and champs and was in store for less than the price of the cheapest skin for a looong time thats a pretty sweet bait in my opinion, hell i'd go for that and did.\n\neveryone has to start somewhere, you are probs s5 then if you are noticing that, thats only a few wins above bronze dont be too high and mighty.\n\nSkins like Lux's steel legion that the edges of the aoe is less visible? unless you are a newbie you should know the range of an ability like that wihtout needing the little circle.\n\nGnar is the first champion i know of to be buffed on release, im sure the people who are employed to do this around the clock have a better idea of how he affects the game than you, plus his win rate is no more or less than his peers in toplane so he obviously doesnt have that much of an impact on the end result.\n\nwhen it happens you know about it otherwise there wouldnt be a point.\n\ni dont know what you are talking about so i dont have an answer\n\ndoes the forgiving of 12 years olds affect you in any way? if so i would be worried\n\ntoxic one aren't you \n\n\n\n\nMoral of the story: Be grateful for what they give us, be happy when we get more stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"Justify","date":"2014-12-22T11:13:09.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"lol baited, it was a troll post with an ounce of truth","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2014-12-22T12:40:49.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My words still stand for anyone else like you who decides to feel ungrateful","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2014-12-22T05:21:35.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably 4 Season Sona.\nQ for the Harsh Winter.\nW for healing Spring / Autumn\nE for Energetic Summer.\nIdek about her ultimate though.
