I'm not sure because of the time difference but you can definitely tell the difference between saying a gold 2 Aus player and a overseas gold 2 player.

Maybe it's because they mostly play against each other early mornings and that's how they got their ranks etc or I just have the worst luck in MM.\n\nMost games I play after 2am are mostly downhill and losses due to non English speaking players playing like boosted animals.\n\nTheir internet is also the flakiest POS and I'm always having games with them constantly disconnecting, rejoining, blaming lag all game long.\n\nTrying not to come across as racist here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xDarkRavenx","date":"2016-09-29T09:29:24.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I had a whole team who were speaking in an Asian language and all wanted to FF at 20, and they all voted yes when the enemy team was only a few kills ahead of us. lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-09-29T05:38:44.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"shouldn't koreans have a good attitude in every game since most koreans are like GODS at lol, so in the OCE server, they should have no problem in games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-09-29T00:19:02.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im Tired of the mother$%#@ing Koreans on this Mother^&*%ing server \n\n(PLS DONT BAN RITO ITS A QUOTE FROM A MOVIE WITH SAMUEL L JACKSON <3 )","replies":[]}]}
