Riven is my main and i want to win but I cant. Split pushing will just bring the whole team to me and i will get melted. I ussually end up with 9-12 kills by midgame but then suddenly i cant go anyhigher and i keep deing until i lose the game. Teamfights used to be easy but now its just 1 stun and im deleted. maybe im not tanky enough or do i Need to MAIN someone else. Riven isnt fun for me anymore coz i lose too much.

I used to have a huge problem with that(really fed until late game and then I kept getting picked off and dying) until I came across a post called 'Why you died' or something on the old forums. It said that if you're dying late game and doing well early then it is probably your positioning. After reading that I tried to fix my positioning by doing a lot of things(eg.researched a lot of spell ranges, aoe spell radius and etc.) and it helped A LOT.\n\nI'm no expert for sure(lvl22) but I think it may just be your general gameplay. Where do you play in teamfights with Riven? You shouldn't engage(unless no one else is better for the job of course) vecause even riven has no natural tankiness and will get shut down by cc before she even has time to deal any damage(source: http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3569476 ).Do you wait and see if their hard cc has been used before going in? Keeping track of abilities used can be very helpful:) \n\nPs have you read any Riven guides? This one is pretty awesome, it even has an entire section on teamfights(with situational scenarios such as when against tanky team and etc.) and is written by a Diamond I!: http://www.lolking.net/guides/106145","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-01-10T06:31:39.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To carry as riven:\n\nat level 1 press Q then auto then press Q then auto then press Q then auto.\nFirst blood you're set for the rest of the game.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nat level 1 press Q then auto then press Q then auto then press Q then auto.\nFirst blood you're set for the rest of the game.","replies":[]}]}
