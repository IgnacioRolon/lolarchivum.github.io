Or, if you knew that you were going against Fizz in champ select, get a defensive summoner spell like {{summoner:3}}{{summoner:21}} .","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-08T12:01:52.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt people have zhonias pre-6... soo...\n\nMy suggestion is to trade hard at lvl1-2, and then play defensive and farm under tower till lvl5, then back and come back into lane with full hp and some mr so he can't just 100-0 you. Fizz can do about 60% to a squishy champion with his tower dive combo, closer to 70% with ignite and flash included, so he's very strong at this point. Another thing you can do it poke him down and then when he dives use cc to stop him from trollpolling. But yeah if you get hit by the shark at lvl5 with less than 70% hp you're probably going to die. Barrier can save you though or if you want a more flexible option, heal permanently gives you and an ally hp and a short burst of movespeed, but it has a longer cooldown and heals less than barrier shields against.\n\nAlso as annoying as fizz is, ragequitting is not cool since you let the teamdown, regardless of what one salty malphite says.","replies":[]}]}]}
