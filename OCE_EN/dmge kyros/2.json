I swear bronze was a better place to be but why the fuck do silvers expect you to be perfect at a champion, and when you mess up ( missing windslash,, missing w) they start this retarded braindead rant on how bad i am at a champion they dont even understand-  and the most fucked up thing about these people is that as soon as 1 says that im bad the whole team starts to fcking flame. then i ask the other team &quot;am i bad?&quot; &quot; UR SO SHIT LMAO&quot; also when i play some other champ like yas and i mess up some fuck wit calls out in all chat &quot; TRASHUO &quot;  ive just had enough of this fucking shit. brb going to demote to bronze","replies":[{"poster":"ShadeZ94","date":"2016-06-05T02:16:16.472+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have a 25% win rate on riven. 32% overall. and a 4.5/7.8 K/D.

I won't say it happens every time because there are players out there who focus more on their own game than other peoples. \n\nNever ever ever ask the other team if they think you're bad, I would say 90% of the time the answer would be yes just to try and get in your head and tilt you. They want to win as much as you do but everyone likes things in their favor.\n\nYou don't want to go back to bronze, it won't be any better and if you sink further into it the worse it can be. You have a 30% win rate on Riven this season. Why don't you give her a rest in ranked get back on her in norms and come back and smash everyone who has doubted you on her. If you know where you go wrong then you can go back and work on it.  When was the last time you played Yasuo? I can't see one game of yas in your last 60.\n\nYou can mute people you can ignore people, it's easier said than done but at the end of the day what they say really doesn't matter unless you start to believe it and let it get to you.","replies":[{"poster":"DMGE Kyros","date":"2016-06-04T14:31:08.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah I main Yas on my other account, but like Ive got an 85% winrate in norms, its just way too easy to practice but as soon as i ranked to try out if the things i worked on in normals apply, it fucks up completely , i just want to improve on riven thats just my goal","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2016-06-03T16:39:07.129+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"When people start mouthing off to me about doing shit I just spam the chat full of ironic memes or just respond with stuff like \"Yes I agree I am bad at this champion\" etc to all insults, it drives them nuts, they are in it for the flame war or to hurt me but I give them nothing","replies":[{"poster":"spellogicV2","date":"2016-06-04T00:31:13.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Best way to deal with'em","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Truegolddigger","date":"2016-06-06T05:51:23.726+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"git gud","replies":[{"poster":"Smelly Sandwich","date":"2016-06-26T05:34:27.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"git guder","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-06-03T15:47:44.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's because your playing champions that are 1v5 carry champs, these tend to get the worst rap because they are the easiest to feed on, and if your not ahead, everyone assumes your shit.\n\nAlso your in silver 5, that's a cesspool of shitty players that think they are good and deserve to climb, but blame everyone else for their fuckups.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-06-03T23:26:21.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh thats from bronze 2 up to gold 2","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-06-03T23:25:22.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because 99.87% of retards dont realise how much skill yu actually need to lay yasuo and riven and not feed","replies":[]}]}
