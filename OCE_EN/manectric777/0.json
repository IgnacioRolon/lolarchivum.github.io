Following this I immediately went to my loot inventory and opened my chest. When the chest opened it revealed that I had gotten an epic skin shard but it did not show the skin or champ that it belongs to. Does anybody know why this occurred or how I can find out what champ it is for?","replies":[{"poster":"Kakoda","date":"2017-02-28T00:26:12.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah happened to me to","replies":[]},{"poster":"CarlosAG","date":"2017-02-25T13:57:01.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also got that same exact problem earlier today..{{champion:22}}","replies":[]}]}
