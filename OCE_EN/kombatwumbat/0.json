My friend later adds him, tells him I'm still waiting, since I was not worried at all. But he replies with \"ill have a gun X hours drive away\" \"will burn your house down\". He has my IP address, which he obtained by tricking me into clicking on a site that had \"all my personal info\". There was nothing on there, but he got my IP address. \r\n\r\nSo I sent a email to Riot explaining what happened and giving them the IGN of me, my friend, and the hacker. \r\n\r\nI sent the email to: \r\nsupport@riotgames.com \r\n\r\nWas this the right place to send the email to? So far I have done nothing other than the email.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-31T23:58:06.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should call the police.\n\nAnd holy %%%%, why would you click a link from someone who sent you a death threat?","replies":[{"poster":"Scientific Pig","date":"2015-02-01T07:02:00.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I clicked it because I wanted to verify that he wasn't bull %%%%ting.
