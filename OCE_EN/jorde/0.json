After this I tried again and it put me in queue and when I accepted champion select was just back, and I had the same loading sign you briefly get before you connect to champ select. I left because I couldn&#039;t do anything and I think it processed as a leave and I lost the usual amount of lp and have to wait 5 minutes. I&#039;ve had quite a few people dodging ranked today, so is there a chance this has happened to anyone else? I don&#039;t really mind the lp loss, I&#039;m just wondering why this happened and if it&#039;s happening to others too. Thanks :)","replies":[]}
