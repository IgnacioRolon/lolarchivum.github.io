I think we deserve to know everything that changed in the patch when you give us patch notes. I&#039;m not your guinea pig and if i am I noticed in the first game I played that bandit was gone and now you&#039;re just gonna play it off like you removed it in 8.6. Come on I think we deserve a bit more respect than that. I know you won&#039;t see this but by any chance if you do next time at least give us the respect we deserve. If you change something we&#039;ll notice we like your game enough to care please show a little more transparency with this stuff in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2018-03-21T09:15:22.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"read more carefully. 8.6 changes are for the twisted treeline versions.
