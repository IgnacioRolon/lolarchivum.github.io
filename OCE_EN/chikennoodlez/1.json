We won. However, the four people in my team including me encountered a very toxic player. His summoners name is What a good duck. This person, who sadly plays League of Legends ruined the beginning of the game for us. Winning required the co-operation of not only me, but the remained of my brilliant team. This &#039;troll&#039; ended up eating his words when we watched him get chased by many members of the enemy team. This report is not only aimed our &#039;Mundo&#039; but to the whole enemy team. That sadly gave the blame to each other, instead of themselves. \r\n\r\nAll I think about is how rotten this Mundo&#039;s attitude was. This player even left the game for an extended part of the match. A swiftly returned to continue making our lives difficult. To make things worse this was in a ranked match. To motivate his vile action was the fact I was on 0 lp and another player was in his provisionals. I want you to read this carefully and not ignore me like many companies. Don&#039;t give there is no point there will be many more, but this is a lvl 30 toxic player. Banning permanently can be the only option :(\r\n\r\nTime I feel is nothing of his concern, racking up more then 10 mins being dead or disconnected. I really want you, Riot, to sort he/she out and tell me what you did. This community can really hit it&#039;s lows, but this was downright unacceptable. Please sort him/her out.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nChikenN00dlez (Ieuan Davies)","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-28T11:48:31.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Banning permanently can be the only option :(\n\nThat's harsh. So we should ban a person because one guy didn't like how he acted in one game? Extreme, yes, but just an example of how a punishment system like this could be turned on its head.\n\nPlease read [this](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules) before posting. If you want to report a player, use the in-client tools to do so. You can include details in the comment box.\n\nIf you somehow managed to miss reporting them from the client, but still want to go through with it, [submit a support ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new) instead of making a post. Name-and-shame only makes the situation worse than it is.\n\nRiot do not store game replays on their server, thus it would not be possible for you to get a replay of the match. If you want to do so in the future, then use a footage recording program and run it while playing your game. Or, if you're daring enough, use LolReplay (be warned that it often causes glitches in the game, or complete crashes sometimes).\n\nI wish you the best of luck in not encountering 'troll' players in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"ChikenNoodlez","date":"2015-05-30T01:30:30.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't say one game.

Reds rarely come here, and when they do it's only because of a huge bug in-game to deal with the influx of new discussions being created about it. You're still better off just making a ticket. That way you'll at least get a reply.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ChikenNoodlez","date":"2015-05-28T10:30:16.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry that I didn't have enough time to submit a proper ticket.
