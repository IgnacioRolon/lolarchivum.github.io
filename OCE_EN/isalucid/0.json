I've even done it by round 7 (which on some places i saw it worked and cleared the mission) but it was still no good... and that was selling all my pieces to try complete the mission,  is anyone having an issue like this?","replies":[{"poster":"CatOnKeyboard","date":"2019-07-08T00:25:36.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its broken, they dont mean round 11, they mean round 7, which is only possibly with some bs pirate luck, about 5% chance","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-07-08T09:36:26.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure they mean round 11, but it seems it was misconfigured to round 7 (counting the round robin at the start and the first shared draft). It's almost certainly not working as intended since no-one can really complete it. It'll either be fixed soon or they'll just roll over to next week's missions and not worry about it.","replies":[{"poster":"CatOnKeyboard","date":"2019-07-08T22:14:59.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah you are probably right, but with 1 day left i doubt a  fix and im missing missions so :( my beta rewards go down the toilet","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-07-09T01:32:30.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Beta points aren't a finite resource though? You get the orb daily and a new mission set weekly. You only lose out on 50 pts which isn't much in the grand scheme of things. It's not like you'll even be behind since no-one else can complete it either.","replies":[{"poster":"SubdueYourMum","date":"2019-07-09T08:46:22.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea but it's a rather large pain in the rectum. I don't think I can complete the challenges anyway guts for me","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
