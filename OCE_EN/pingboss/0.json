It&#039;s killing me how many games i need to play to get out of my B5 placement into silver+.  Why isn&#039;t there some reward for playing above your rank to help progress, increased LP per game or skip a fkn level here and there.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-02-05T13:35:38.214+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is. If your MMR is high enough, you can skip a division or 2.\n\nYou know you have high MMR when you are getting over 30+ LP for wins and only losing like 10 or less for losses. That usually means you will skip a division after your next promos. \n\nYou must have had REALLY bad MMR if you win 17 games in a row and only climb 2 divisions. Each division should be 6 wins, 0 losses (0-100 LP in 4 games and 2 promo wins) with good MMR.

Not sure why my MMR was so bad, went 6W4L in placements with the help of 2 games with afkers but started winning from there basically.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-06T11:59:28.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's usually slow to start. In my experience, the only ones who really get to skip divs are those whose mmr is at least a tier and a half above their rank. \n\nThe only consistency I've seen in div skips is with new ranked teams with players who are Diamond~. The have the flat mmr for new ranked players in placements (mid Silver) and get placed S1 or G5 then skips divs 2 or 3 at a time up to Diamond basically.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jehovahs Witness","date":"2016-02-06T12:24:57.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BarryButcher,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=QWJPsmw5,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-02-05T13:35:38.214+0000)\n>\n> There is.

As expected, I won my Promos and only ranked up to Bronze 1. I was pretty salty lmao but I won 2 games and was on 67LP. I don't get this MMR - LP thing :/","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pingboss","date":"2016-02-06T00:36:56.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still only get 24LP a game =p","replies":[]}]}
