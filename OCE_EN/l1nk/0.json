It shows people that League isn't just a game, its a whole culture, with music, art, cosplay etc. And when you feel like your part of a culture, you respect it more. \n\nRather than excluding people through harsher punishments, I think we should be focusing on building the league culture and community. \nIt could just be my imagination, but I notice less toxicity during events like Ocean Week. I believe that being part of a community striving for a goal, makes people more respectful of each other, and songs/videos like Get Jinxed and Ignite, remind people that league doesn't happen only on the rift.\n\nAnd its so easy to rally people behind a catchy song.\n\nI also It would be nice to somehow bring the Boards, and In-game communities closer. (there are people talked to on here for years, and have never played with.) I think some of the Volunteers are really making an effort though, its great, and id encourage people to join them:\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment/IBUY7Hn7-join-the-arbiters-and-league-volunteers-on-discord","replies":[]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2017-03-24T14:35:17.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like harsher penalties for intent feeding and a tribunal system instead of this dumb ass automatic system needs to be implemented.","replies":[]}]}
