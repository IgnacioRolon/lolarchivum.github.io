Especially in flex and normals where you might be with a 3 and 4 stack. In R6 siege(which has a quick system  4 votes out of 5 needed to kick) I've been kicked before not because I was trolling or playing badly but simply because they wanted to try a stupid strat they'd seen on YouTube and I didn't. \n\nYou can report people being assholes in the lobby theough a support ticket. Maybe the soloution is to make that easier. However a kick system is super dangerous, you might get a situation where anything off meta or swingy champs would just get kicked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HaveYouSeenMyCat","date":"2017-05-27T06:04:33.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i can see it being abused but tbh i would rather sit in  a que for 20 mins than play for 20 with the toxic person that stole my lane (without calling) and is just inting and flaming making it a waste of time and un-enjoyable. Also if you don't have much time to play a game don't get into a game, who knows how long that game will go, could be 15 min or an hour. I have some faith in this community ( i know i shouldn't ) that they wont kick you just because who you want to play isn't meta. I personally would prefer you to play someone you like and know than pick a champ just because they are meta ATM, i mean if you don't know how to play the champion you will probably do worse than the non meta pick you've got 10 s ranks on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2017-05-26T14:29:55.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Abusable?\n\nHow about you all use your brains a little?\n\nAll you have to do is GIVE A LIMIT ON HOW MANY TIMES YOU CAN VOTE KICK A DAY\n\nE.G 2 VOTE KICKS A DAY","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-25T17:04:41.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The biggest concern Riot has is creating something that isn't abuse-able, and that doesn't mean people are waiting forever to get into a game. As it is remakes can make wait times excruciatingly long, especially for people with not much time to play. I think we all agree that a remake is preferable to the alternative, but it has it's own frustrations.\n\nRiot is still working on ways to relieve these pain points but they aren't really ones for bandaid measures, if they're going to put something in place for this, they're going to do their very best to get it right the first time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HaveYouSeenMyCat","date":"2017-05-25T14:08:37.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"seems legit too me","replies":[]}]}
