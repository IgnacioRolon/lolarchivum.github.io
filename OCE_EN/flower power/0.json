At no cost, (I purely mean a day out snorkeling the reef, accommodation and travel cost should be at the summoners expense) perhaps a voucher of some kind would be an appropriate method of doing this..\r\n\r\nMy reasons for suggesting this:\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it would create exposure for the great barrier reef, people will become more aware of the of its struggles, and the more people who know the better off the reef will be and we may have a chance at saving our Beautiful Heritage listed Park..\r\n\r\nSecond, having people travel to see the Nautalis reef will generate huge income for the local population, in Queensland, not only that but for the Great Barrier Reef as a whole.\r\n\r\nI know that for me, if i was in Queensland I wouldn&#039;t want to stop at just the Nautalis Reef i would want to continue exploring a significant amount of the reef. In turn more income will be generated for the reef.\r\n\r\nand finally and i said this in the beginning, i believe the Australian summoners who made this operation possible deserve a more fitting reward.\r\n\r\nAnd what would be more rewarding than seeing our own handiwork.\r\nit would be inspiring. :)\r\n\r\nPlease consider this and keep up the good work rito. :) peace\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKid Rat","replies":[{"poster":"Strawberry","date":"2016-05-04T22:36:37.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something like this would be pretty sweet but I'd make it a more general effort. For example:\n\nPeople who play league can get a discount (depending on what kind of deal Riot could possibly strike) for visiting the reef. Might not sound as much but it sounds realistic and people who want to actually see the reef are capable of doing so and it's a friendly nudge from Riot towards the players that want to. \n\nLove the idea and it would be cool to have something like this happening! it's there now, bet summoners want to see it too! \n\n- Strawberry {{summoner:31}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gaslight","date":"2016-04-15T09:06:03.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"40,000 names on the statue * $50 price to snorkel = cost of $2 million to Riot.\n\nYeah, can't see them doing that, and I'm being generous with the $50 price tag.","replies":[{"poster":"Flower Power","date":"2016-04-19T22:08:08.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"doesnt have to cost riot a cent, they would just have to continue their relationship with the queensland government, \nas they would have to have had extensive conversations with the same people in order to plan the nautalis reef in the first place, just re negotiate some kind of agreement for the players to come visit the site.","replies":[{"poster":"Flower Power","date":"2016-04-19T22:10:30.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the biggest issue i believe is the fact that not even 10% of the 40,000 would have their scuba licences","replies":[{"poster":"Flower Power","date":"2016-04-21T06:42:49.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sure you have valid points, and you could continue to scrutinize the idea and come up with reasons why it would not work.....\n\nin saying that there are plenty of pros to my argument, and it could be a worthy idea given the correct ground work was done","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gaslight","date":"2016-04-20T04:08:15.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's going to cost someone, and I can't see the QLD government paying for it, or the local businesses doing it for free.
