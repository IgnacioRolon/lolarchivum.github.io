Surely it pans out after the &quot;learning curve&quot; (Which is around level 40), but honestly, over 50 levels apart is a huge difference.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-03T12:22:07.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is probably more appropriate for Misc or Gameplay and Strategy (Help and Support is more for technical issues and doesn't appear on the front page of boards) but I'll try to help you out.\n\nThere are two big things to remember here. The first is smurfs, the second is that level is more an indication of time played than it is skill. I'm only just level 70 but am ranked high Gold, while there is a level 190 on my friends list who is low Silver, and a level 55 who is low Diamond.\n\nThat's where MMR (matchmaking rating) comes in. It's basically your hidden 'rank'. It's just a number but it's the number that determines who you are matched with/against, rather than your level or rank, and it takes into account the skill of players you've beaten and lost to, rather than just how many games or how long you've played for.\n\nNormal MMR is always going to be less accurate than in ranked, because in ranked play is more consistent. In ranked players will be on their best champs in their best roles on their best days most of the time, whereas in normals they'll be trying new champs or builds or maybe just aren't having the best day, so skill is a lot more inconsistent.\n\nThe tl;dr is don't put too much stock in just level when considering the skill of your opponents, because time played is going to affect individual skill differently.","replies":[]}]}
