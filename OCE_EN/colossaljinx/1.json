If you could report directly to their profile, &amp; maybe select the game you experienced them in, or report them through match history, this would be very helpful.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-27T11:03:18.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will stress this first and foremost, if post game reporting is available it is *always* the best option to report.\n\nThat said, if a lobby dodges, or your post game doesn't load etc etc you can submit reports to Player Support. Support can't and won't tell you anything about another players account though (privacy and also prevents witch hunts) so don't expect anything more than a generic \"thanks for your report\" response.\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"colossalJinx","date":"2018-04-06T08:14:58.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I went to player support when this occurred & worked out fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2018-04-08T02:16:12.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's great to hear!
