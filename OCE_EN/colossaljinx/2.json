For Twisted Treeline specifically, Normal blind is stated to run on Tuesday-Wednesday from 3:00pm-1:00am AEDT and Ranked Flex is stated to run on Thursday-Friday 5:00pm - 0:00am AEDT (though the queue schedule thread currently states \"regular schedule not in effect\" for ranked).\n\nHonestly, it would be good if it was just stated normally like with the options for Summoner's Rift, but for some reason that just doesn't happen.","replies":[]}]}
