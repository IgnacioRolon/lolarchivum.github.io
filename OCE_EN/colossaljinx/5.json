The well-known loveable &amp; somewhat crazy yordle. \n\nHer [splash](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_large/public/upload/art/bg_champion_lulu_1920x1080.jpg?itok=KsQJjjdj) is great, but... [that model...](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/c/ca/Lulu_Render.png/revision/20140403100124) Lulu was introduced before Tristana&#039;s rework (March 2012 to be exact, where Tristana [was reworked](https://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/champion-update/champion-update-tristana) from a megling to a yordle in early 2015, not to forget [Poppy&#039;s rework](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/champion-update-poppy-keeper-hammer) too), so... I refer to this time as the &quot;Megling Era&quot;, when the Megling design was rampant on [Tristana](https://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/9/91/Tristana_OriginalSkin_old.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141014012025) &amp; especially [Poppy](https://pm1.narvii.com/5945/d1c0824d60c042b412f89e74dacad5d7a87f693a_hq.jpg).\nWe can see in Lulu&#039;s model here with her small, elvish ears, &amp; round face, &amp; flat, round nose. &amp; lack of furry appearance. \nNot only her face, but her body too. She has 5 fingers. Her arms are long &amp; gaunt, her body very short. She looks more like a witch (like, humanish witch not a yordle). If we look at older skins, they sport a megling appearance. Like [Bittersweet Lulu](http://lolwp.com/wp-content/uploads/Bittersweet-Lulu.jpg) , in [fan arts](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f6/9a/6d/f69a6d953f51e58c52c252e611cb35fc--candy-girls-sweet-treats.jpg) people make this skin look great &amp; cute, but the model for the skin &amp; the splash just don&#039;t match the concept of Lulu we now have (post-megling era). \n\nWe can see Rito try to fix this with refreshed skins like [Dragon Trainer](https://pm1.narvii.com/6077/53fd0969d720bf06c669e98576317dbc831ab0e5_hq.jpg) &amp; [Star Guardian](https://orig00.deviantart.net/857f/f/2016/281/1/b/star_guardian_lulu_by_missmaddytaylor-dak9osz.png) , See her newest SG skin, her ears are fluffy. (Unlike in her original)\n&amp; although the face is better, just the body is still gaunt &amp; awkward, not yordle-like. \nI feel as though her entire model just needs to be re-done, at least the original (because the skins would be difficult, esp. with a fairly new skin out). The colours are obnoxious, as well. I don&#039;t particularly play her (but I am a yordle ambassador, I draw yordles &amp; a Poppy main) so I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s worth the extent of a rework, but a serious VU, not just a retexture but a serious model change. Her stance, of being hunched over &amp; awkward is alright but her proportions are just wrong. Gaunt.\n\n**TL;DR :** _Lulu&#039;s original model is old &amp; outdated, sporting a megling design, &amp; needs to be completely re-done to fit the current design of a yordle._","replies":[]}
