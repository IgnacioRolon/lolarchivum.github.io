There&#039;s been an issue with bots in ARAM, &amp; with the amount of dodging occurring in Normal Draft, I am starting to wonder if there&#039;s some kind of bot that joins a Draft queue just to dodge it. It sounds ridiculous but the sheer amount of dodging is even more ridiculous. \r\n\r\n.-. ?&iquest;","replies":[{"poster":"Jeneral Pain","date":"2017-12-31T09:41:03.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just joined a game - Ranked Bronze 4 which is in essence ELO hell...\nSupport - Twitch\nJungle - Vayne\n\nThe problem is, the justice system does not punish the perpetrators of trolling.\n\nThe previous game I ended up with a vayne who sooked in chat the ENTIRE GAME about how the morg was stealing their CS (mostly because he didn't know to last hit the minions) and then went AFK costing us the game.
