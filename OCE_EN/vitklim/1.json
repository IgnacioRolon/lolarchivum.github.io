As a worldbuilder myself, I&rsquo;ve in most cases looked up to League as a superior example of a universe that coins itself upon mixing fantasy and realism into a fully believable blend, renewing itself over time, but always staying, what&rsquo;s the word?... sensible within it&rsquo;s bounds. I&rsquo;m myself generally not keeping up with the various leaks, spoilers, and anything else that would reveal a champion before their announcement, so when I came across the release page yesterday, my only question was: What am I looking at? I&rsquo;ve read through the ability descriptions, watched the preview, and pondered at the visuals for a bit before reaching the splash art for the classic and release skins. Then I leaned back in my chair, and only one thought came to mind: &quot;Riot, what the fuck were you thinking?&quot;\r\n\r\nI&rsquo;m 100% sure that if I were to show the splash art of Kai&rsquo;sa to anyone who has not heard of the release announcement (and that is assuming they even play League), and asked them one simple question: &quot;What game do you think this is from?&quot;, Their response would be: Starcraft. Or something in a similar vein. Then, if I were to show her release skin splash art, the answer could be any sci-fi game ever. Like, no shit, in any other game ever, her default skin would be the release skin, and I feel like the connection to the Void was only put in place to allow such ridiculous concept of a champion to make it into League. As a player and a lore digger, I&#039;ve have come to accept the rules that the universe has set for itself. I can accept that technology in this world has paused its development at the level of steampunk machinery and substituted the rest with magic. I can accept that beings entirely made out of ice (Anivia, Lissandra) can exist in the same world as the human-beast creatures of legends (Ahri, Wukong, Rengar, the list goes on). I accepted that the celestial beings hailing from mount Targon can compare in power to regular human warriors of only above average power (Darius, Garen). But most of these things don&rsquo;t contradict, their existence in the same world is believable. But if you take Kai&rsquo;sa and line her up against the already existing champions, she looks so out of place it isn&rsquo;t even funny. And particularly talking about the Void, as her stated origin, it is much easier to believe into a sentient beholder creature that surges with energy and seeks knowledge of the world, than a human who somehow gained a symbiotic suit, or whatever the hell that thing is, complete with a pair of things that suspiciously look like thrusters, and blasting everything in her path with plasma.\r\n\r\nThis champion just doesn&rsquo;t belong in League. How can a character with an appearance and abilities resembling advanced sci-fi technology so closely, be believable alongside the rest of the world that Riot has been trying to build for so long? Which makes me raise the question: Why set the boundaries for your reality, for your world, if you try to surpass them anyway, and pass it off as part of the world? Like, I get it, I like sci-fi too, and I would love to see a proper champion of that kind, but the excuse of tying her to the Void, and that serving as the only explanation for the concept, is so flimsy. If Riot wants to create a champion who uses advanced technology, then integrate it into the universe, or rework it yet again, to make the champion believable. Or else abandon the idea entirely. You can&rsquo;t just create a champion out of nothing, and then loosely bind them to one of the factions without reason or explanation, or your world begins to fall apart.\r\n\r\nI feel like I should make it clear, I&rsquo;m not hating on the champion because of any gameplay concerns, or because I don&rsquo;t like the game itself. No, I do, and I wouldn&rsquo;t even call it hate, it&rsquo;s just the feeling of confusion and disappointment that Riot actually didn&rsquo;t see the fundamental flaw of their own creation. Kai&rsquo;sa in her current form does not belong in League. Trying to ground a character so obviously out of place into this world, will only shake the foundations of what made League&rsquo;s universe believable in the first place. I hope Riot will take attention to this, and either rework the champion&rsquo;s narrative and visual design, or abandon the concept entirely, because as cool as it potentially is, it should not exist in the world of League.","replies":[{"poster":"Novo","date":"2018-02-24T18:21:24.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hear that we are getting a Void adc and as a support main I was so hyped for some sick beast crazy high skill champion that would be non human! seeing as the only other adcs that are played bot that arent humanoid are twitch and kogmaw so I was looking forward to it.\n\nI wondered for ages what interesting new mechanics will it have seeing as they can do crazy stuff with the void powers, I was hoping for something that had interesting auto attacks, maybe one like vel'kos because his have no travel time or something cool like that but instead I was so disappointed at this bland uninspired design :/ I guess it has a rift jump next to a target for a engage or chase so thats kinda cool? nothing else is new with it really and my god, the design is so boring, she couldn't of been any more like vayne in personality and look, she may as well have a line saying \"I smell void magics\".\n \nJust a hunter chick, I guess she has tits so rito will still rake in cash with people buying her and her skins. Lets hope when we get a void support eventually in 2024 it isn't just a Janna copy in a purple skin tight suit with void powers. :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-02-23T08:44:24.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i mean I would have found it more believable if she was a researcher from Zaun or a similar place, exploring the practical applications of void energy. I mean that would make alot of sense lore wise right? Why from a faction of monsters, insects, corrupted and twisted beings, do we now we have a chick in a powersuit, she's so genericly scifi from a faction whose design has traditionally been freakish, unusual and monstrous. She doesn't seem to fit...","replies":[{"poster":"Vitklim","date":"2018-02-24T10:27:49.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem that I see isn't even entirely with her origin. I just can't stomach the design of that suit with essentially a plasma powered jetpack on the back existing in League's universe. Like, chemtech, or piltover machinery could produce a suit of similar functionality, but it would look completely differently, and be stylised accordingly. But the appearance of the suit and the abilities that it gives her lean so closely to traditional sci-fi, that you just can't ignore it. It contradicts the design of other Void-based champions, it contradicts the visual design of League as a whole, and all Riot did was basically rebrand the \"sci-fi suit with a jetpack on the back\" concept to make it a part of League.","replies":[]}]}]}
