{"poster":"Vitklim","date":"2019-10-16T07:40:20.873+0000","title":"Let's discuss them preseason changes","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disclaimer: I am writing this as a Plat toplaner, so my primary overview of these changes will be from the perspective of someone who primarily plays top and is not the best at the game, even though I am relatively high up the ladder.\r\n\r\nSo, Riot has released a briefing on what they are changing in Preseason, and I have a number of opinions on the subject. If I do not mention a change that was outlined in that post, it means I find it unobjectionable (Like the support item changes), otherwise I will rip into most of them.\r\n\r\n1. Elemental rifts\r\nThis change is exceptionally likely to prove absolutely gamebreaking for high elo play, where macro, rotations and generally playing around the map itself is incredibly important. The map change that is likely to have the greatest effect across the board is the Cloud Rift, which has the potential make chasing and fights in the jungle heavily favor the winning side, since they will be able to very easily force fights.\r\nHowever, that is not even the greatest problem. The main problem is that this is yet again, RNG. And of a much higher magnitude than the drakes or the plants were before. This will throw in another unknowable variable into the mix, and will inevitably lead to absolutely unfair situations. If you want an example, how about a Rengar in a game with the Ocean Rift? Or Poppy and Ornn on a Mountainous Rift? Any champion that interacts with environment is going to either suffer or receive a major buff, with no consistency or way to prepare. This is bad game design, since it limits the player's control over the game even more.\r\nI also would seriously want to know at what point Riot expects the Rifts to spawn in. If a Rift spawns immediatly after the second drake is killed, then we're talking around 13 minutes, a minute before the plating falls, so it would have some impact on the mid-game fights. If they spawn only before the third drake arrives, then they will likely only have impact on playing around Baron and topside jungle.\r\n\r\n2. Drake Buff changes\r\nThe biggest problem with the base buff changes is the Ultimate CDR that the Cloud now gives. I understand that Riot feels like the movement speed the old buff provided was not impactful enough, but I disagree. It was the perfect tool for rotating, outmanouvering the evemy team, and for assassins to pick off targets. This new version conflicts with the Ultimate Hunter rune, and is going to be massive for some champions, and mean nothing for others. It's not a good change in my opinion.\r\nThe Souls are another whole can of worms, and to be honest, I would prefer that Riot scrap them entirely. The greatest problem is with the Cloud Soul. It turns every champion into Ezreal, and for champions with either already low cooldowns, or deliberately high ones, it is going to absolutely break the game balance. It is essentialy giving Spear of Shojin to everyone on the team that has it, except you don't even have to buy the item. Imagine how this is going to work with champions like Sylas, Renekton, Lucian, Riven, any champion that is heavily focused on spellcasting, and it is going to make them absolutely broken in that single situation, for no reason and with no way to counteract it. It is single handedly the worst idea for this entire preseason.\r\nThe rest of the souls are equally broken in relation to each other, and I yet again, would prefer that they did not exist.\r\n\r\n3. Elder Drake Execution\r\nAgain, another horrendous idea, with no consideration of how it impacts the game. This can essentialy be read as: Enemy team has X less health. This is what it's going to function like, and will be awful for whatever team is playing against it.\r\nI would suggest, if Riot wants to rebalance the Elder buff so it allows for a behind team to make use of it, to for instance, have it give 3 random Elemental buffs instead. That would equalize the behind team with their opponents, or help the team that is ahead, snowball even harder, which is the concept for Elder to be there in the first place.\r\n\r\n4. Side Lane Alcoves\r\nThis is going to yet again, screw with the balance of champions that interact with environment (Poppy, Ornn, Camille, Illaoi), however, has the potential to provide for more space for extended fights in toplane. We'll see how this change works out, I expect people to find a way to abuse it.\r\n\r\n5. Jungle and Toplane Woes\r\nThis is something that I can very adequately explain to Riot and anyone who doesn't play toplane. The Jungler decides Top. Most melee toplaners, bruisers and tanks, can only escape a gank once, when their flash is up, if even that much, since the meta right now favors gank-heavy junglers, and most of them have reliable ways to engage on you, and easily 2v1. There is little penalty for not repeatedly ganking top, since the jungler gets enough shared XP to not fall behind in that regard, and farm heavy junglers are weak right now.\r\nFrom the toplane side of problems, most toplaners do not scale well enough into the late game, and split-pushing has also become a weaker approach. It is much more effective to roam the map in a 4-5 man death squad, than to split push a lane, and have your team go for small 2-3 man skirmishes, while you draw attention to a side lane.\r\nThe best way of fixing the situation at least somewhat is to punish repeated ganks onto a single lane, so that if a jungler does that, they fall behind in XP, and make ganking top harder. Then, find a way to make strictly teamfighting less effective, so that there is a variety of strategies instead of a 5 man deathball.\r\n\r\n6. Conqueror changes\r\nThis change is pretty much guaranteed to kill bruisers. And it won't make tanks viable, which is what Riot wants. Tanks are not played anymore for two reasons. For one, they have always been and still are, teamwork reliant much more than other classes. Since you can't carry with a tank, you are relying on your team to play off you, and solo Q is never going to foster that. Second, their itemization against magic damage is shit. There are only three reliable magic resist items: Spirit Visage, Adaptive Helm, and Abyssal Mask. None of them provide anything for laning phase, they give less magic resist than any armor item, and less health in most cases too. I am not counting Zz'rot and Gargoyle Stoneplate, since they are situational and should not be a staple for any MR heavy build. Then, we take into account the 33 magic penetration than most mages can reliably build into, with a 40% magic pen item that is 150 gold cheaper, and has 5% more penetration than its AD counterpart, and you can see the problem.\r\nBruisers are not the reason tanks are not being played top.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I have pretty much summed up my objections to the preseason changes so far, and I would like to see discussion in the comments. If you are going to argue your position, please explain what your disagreement is and why, I will be glad to discuss.","replies":[{"poster":"mindyourface","date":"2019-10-16T16:21:15.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they need to nerf garen tbh lets go, lets see it happen","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-10-17T18:55:47.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=mindyourface,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=63hM7R4R,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-10-16T16:21:15.723+0000)\n>\n> they need to nerf garen tbh lets go, lets see it happen\n\nShaco, Garen, and Pyke are all getting nerfed in 9.20.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vitklim","date":"2019-10-17T03:16:56.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, but the key issue with Garen is that his only weakness is kiting. Most melee champions cannot fight him up close, since his E outdamages bruisers in close range, and shreds armor, making it effective against tanks too. So the only way to fight him is to never get close to him, or to bait out his E and kill him before it comes up again. Plus the damage on his ultimate is way too high.\n\nNevertheless, the Conqueror change will not affect him, since he already has armor shred in his kit, and will outdamage tanks thanks to it. So this nerf will not deal with his problems, he will be just as broken as he is now. The only way he will be picked less, is if toplane gets flooded with ranged champions that can kite him forever, which is worse for the balance of top overall. Or, if Riot decides to nerf him, or toss some scalings around to make pure damage builds less effective.","replies":[]}]}]}
