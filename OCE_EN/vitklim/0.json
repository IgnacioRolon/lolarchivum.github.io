Different, but better in my opinion.\r\n\r\nHowever, he desperately needs to be fixed. His W is damn near useless against anyone with even a bit of mobility and common sense, his Q is fine early on, but becomes painfully slow as the game progresses and leaves you open to any Yasuo you will ever face. His E is good, but similarly to Q, too slow as the game progresses. Plus Riot definitely played way too safe with his cooldowns, stripping a few seconds from his base cooldowns at all ranks would do him justice. 16 seconds on rank 1 Q is a joke. 20 seconds on dodge charges, even more so. His ultimate.... I got no idea. Make it so the cast is really fast and doesn&#039;t break your combo, and make it so it charges as you do damage, credit to RossBoomsocks for the idea. Also make so you get a very clear indicator when it&#039;s about to run out, because that can fuck you over too.\r\n\r\nTL;DR - Make his Q cast faster by something like 15% with every cast, ramping up to the third. Make it so Q and E gain cast speed with levels. Make it so his W has no range on the second proc and the enemy gets pulled regardless or make both procs of the slow at least 50%. Shave off 2-4 seconds from his base cooldowns, most importantly his E. Make it so his ult doesn&#039;t break combo and scales with damage dealt and has a clear indicator of running out.\r\n\r\nThat would about fix the guy IMOï»¿","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-07-04T13:45:36.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's what I would suggest to Riot Games.

Let the meta settle down a bit and find his niche (seems to be early-mid game). Don't listen to every pandering noob on reddit. Listen to Diamond 1+ players only. Thanks.","replies":[]}]}
