Neeko","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh looky, a new champ with a new game-breaking mechanic. This time the cancer levels seem to have surpassed Zoe and Riot still doesn&#039;t give a fuck.\n\nAnyway, here&#039;s my prediction on what&#039;s gonna happen next, let&#039;s grab popcorn and watch:\n1. YouTube is going to explode with clickbaity shit on how broken Neeko is, which in this case is completely warranted.\n2. As soon as pros hear about this, the majority is going to tell Riot that this is a horrible idea, which they will ignore.\n3. 70% of playerbase (me included) will scream at Riot that this is the worst idea ever, while the other 30% will compliment them for &quot;new and radical&quot; gameplay mechanics until they play against Neeko for 10 games, after which 20% of them will defect to the other side.\n4. PBE will be flooded with people desperate to try her out early, but that has been the staple for the past however long, so w/e.\n5. As soon as she is released she will be banned for a month straight in 95% of ranked and draft pick games, and blind pick will be flooded with people who want to play her.\n6. 20% of players will buy the release bundle and only then realise that she will be banned to shit for an eternity.\n7. After a month or two, she will noobstomp people in SIlver/Low Gold, and become nonexistent in every single rank above, because everyone will counterpick and camp her to shit.\n8. She will become forgotten with a popularity rate of Aurelion Sol, until the next Worlds rolls around and someone picks her. When that happens, she will become instabanned for the entire series, become super popular in Ranked Bronze - Plat games, and hyperbanned in most elos after a couple of days. And then the cycle will repeat next year.\n\nCall me pissy, but when Riot removed Trickster&#039;s Glass from the good ol&#039; Bilgewater event, there was a good reason for doing so. Destabilizing the game this much is the dumbest fucking idea they could come up with.\n\n{{summoner:14}} {{summoner:14}} {{summoner:14}} \nFucking wish Riot would delete her from the game, but we all know that ain&#039;t gonna happen :c\n\nP.S. Meanwhile, leave it up to Riot to handle their own website in the most incompetent way possible by making me scoot over to the NA version of the website to even disappoint myself with the new champ reveal. Way to go Rito, way to go.","replies":[{"poster":"OCEshots","date":"2018-11-22T03:13:35.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"honestly after reading this I thought you'd be at least low silver.\n\n\"game breaking\" - the fact that she has a bard/lux ability as her E, karthus Q ability as her Q and a moving nunu ult as her R makes her not game breaking at all in the slightest. along with LB's passive as an active for her W.\n\n\nshe has a passive that isn't that confusing at all. \n\n\njust another post about something new being hard....","replies":[{"poster":"Vitklim","date":"2018-11-22T09:27:41.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've got the wrong definition of \"game breaking\" pal. Riot introduces new mechanics in the majority of the new champions they release, but this time they are going in the wrong freaking direction. We had new debuffs in form of Ornn's Brittle and a couple of champs receiving Grounding like Cassiopaea and Singed. We had Pyke with his gold sharing mechanic on the ultimate and him filling a new niche in the support role. Thing is, these mechanics were limited to the champions themselves and didn't affect the game as a whole.\n\nBut when you throw being able to mind-trick your enemy in a shitload of different cases, it fucks up the balance of the game as a whole. The closest thing I would compare Neeko to is Evelynn, because if these champions are in a game, you have to adjust your whole playstyle to respond to that. Difference being that Evelynn is vulnerable, she is weak early, can be cc'd and quickly killed if she goes in, etc. By the time you figure out that whatever champ you are being approached by is Neeko, is likely to be too late. The fact that she is in the game means that the enemy team will have to play every situation in the most careful way possible. It destabilizes the game way too much. As I said, there is a reason that Deadman's Plate stayed in the game and Trickster's Glass didn't.\n\nThrow in her W in the mix and the fact that her E can provide her team all cc they need, and it becomes a shitshow. Apparently Riot didn't learn from 8.13 that diversity and a clownfest are different things. Shame. Mind games are way too unbalanced of a mechanic to be used widely, and unlike LeBlanc or Shaco, Neeko can pull them on literally anyone on the enemy team. It's a mechanic that does not deserve to be in the game. When I play League, I want the games to be determined by straightforward skill. I don't want to be forced to play in fear the entire game because the enemy team comp has one single champion that skews the playfield.\n\nAnd the worst part is, you can see that she was built with mind games as a primary mechanic from the ground up. Which means the only thing left for me is to hope that she fails gameplay and balance wise so horribly that Riot will rework her years down the line and never implement another mindgame champion again.\n\nIn the meantime, if you have any more proper arguments behind you, go ahead, justify them to me. If not, then you could spend a minute to look me up and realise that I'm plat 5, [REMOVED - [DON'T BE A JERK](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules)]","replies":[]}]}]}
