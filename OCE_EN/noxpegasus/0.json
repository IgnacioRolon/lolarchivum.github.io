But it feels bad already knowing I'm not getting URF, let alone thinking that you get all hyped up for it, then Riot reveals it's not coming this years, and you know you have to go out to the army at the end of the month.\n\nI can imagine it's pretty disappointing. When I saw and heard the login screen and Tahm's skin, I legit thought URF was here. Then I logged in, and my facial expression was probably the most shocked in disappointment I have ever been, because I was just rocking out a minute ago. And thinking if I knew they I had to leave and not come back for a LONG time at the end of the month, a tear would probably fall to my eye.\n\nBut only because I'm such a League addict. \n\n{{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}}","replies":[{"poster":"Saythes","date":"2016-04-02T01:39:52.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not the 4th, it's the 1st... 1/4/16","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-04-02T01:43:28.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Read the site, it says Draven is throwing a party on April 4th 16:59.
