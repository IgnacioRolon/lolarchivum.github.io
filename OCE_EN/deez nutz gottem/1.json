(this could help work out if it is a PC issue or a connection issue)\n* Does anything else using your internet connection have issues at the same time this occurs in League?\n* Does it happen more at a particular time of day?\n* When you changed ISP to Foxtel, did you change anything else on your home network at the same time (eg. Router, Wifi setup etc)?\n* When you say you've tried everything on the help and support page, I assume you are talking about the [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) article (if not, try it out) :)\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"DEEZ NUTZ GOTTEM","date":"2015-07-17T04:44:06.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey i replied to you could i get some more help seems like other people have the same problem","replies":[]},{"poster":"DEEZ NUTZ GOTTEM","date":"2015-07-13T06:45:29.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes minions dont move but the attacks do i can move and attack people but i cant see them and they stop moving i cant see my animations or anything i just slide around and no nothing else laggs at the same time and it happens at any time of the day a friend thinks its the way my internet connects to league it didnt happen with my old isp","replies":[{"poster":"Bonkaz","date":"2015-07-13T18:35:01.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have exactly the same issue, my wife and i both play, different pc's, when one of us plays, its exactly as described above, when we both play, we get dropped out of pvp.net altogether. i goto speedtest.net... get 12mbps/1mbps but i CANNOT get a ping reply from pvp.net at all, there is definatly and issue with foxtel and pvp.net, they do use telstra broadband, but who knows what routing they are using within the network.
