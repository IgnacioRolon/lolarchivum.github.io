This account is from season 2 and I&#039;ve spent countless on it, it&#039;s my baby!\r\n\r\nI can&#039;t recover it cause they won&#039;t help and on top of that its been banned, I&#039;m reaching out here for some kind of additional support","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-08-15T07:56:40.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While the actions on your account may not have been intentional by you, these scripting applications were used on the account and as such, the account has been suspended for that reason.

With that being said, you could go to [**Player Behavior & Moderation (NA)**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation) and appeal to any Rioters; however, the suspension is justified and the current policy is to not reverse these types of suspensions. \n\nAll the best,\nWuks","replies":[{"poster":"Sc00ba","date":"2016-08-15T09:53:40.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for you reply and help, I'll make my way over there and see if someone can help me, there's nothing worse than having information stolen","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-08-15T11:09:13.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sc00ba,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=vBLbxkNQ,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-08-15T09:53:40.328+0000)\n>\n> Thanks for you reply and help, I&#x27;ll make my way over there and see if someone can help me, there&#x27;s nothing worse than having information stolen\n\nAnytime, good luck!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
