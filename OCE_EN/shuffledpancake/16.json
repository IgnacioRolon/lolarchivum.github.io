Id suggest earn enough to cover strictly maintenance costs. League is free, what about other games you want to run? With xbox and ps4 dont they have montly fees to use over the net now? \nIf it was me, id stay with leage and PCs, that already have windows. Sell consoles to put to your funds for lol pcs. Cos you would run into huge snags with consoles. They make money though selling games and making console accounts, league just sells skins to an individuals account. Thats y league is soo good.","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-21T10:21:18.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ThatsBS,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=EonguPPR,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-05-21T10:16:07.886+0000)\n>\n> Small fee definitely, wear and tear on your stuff.
