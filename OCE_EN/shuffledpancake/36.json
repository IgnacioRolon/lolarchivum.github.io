(this was practice for a picture i wanted to draw for the art competition on atm, but uni came up so i probs wont be able to draw the whole picture)","replies":[]},{"poster":"I MAlN TEEMO","date":"2015-07-19T15:08:15.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If i were you i'd try posting on some hobby drawing forum.
