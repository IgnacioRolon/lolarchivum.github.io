I have done good with diana,azir,urgot braum for my first match, but i havent gotten round to getting enough ip due to not having a good role to carry me through to getting ip. it takes me like a week of straight wins to get the ip and if i lose on a 50/50 ratio its worse not by x2 lol","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-20T09:33:11.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go through the champs you own then, find one you like, and get good on it.","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-20T09:34:24.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=V8MFlWgo,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-20T09:33:11.186+0000)\n>\n> Go through the champs you own then, find one you like, and get good on it.\n\nThats the thing, i see a champ think i might like them (after watching millions of videos) then hate them when i actually get to play (not on free week)","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-20T09:39:01.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well what sort of champion do you actually enjoy playing, answer that first.","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-20T09:41:04.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=V8MFlWgo,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-20T09:39:01.375+0000)\n>\n> Well what sort of champion do you actually enjoy playing, answer that first.\n\nHahaha kind of what the post is about :P (tho the title and desc werent clear enough)","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-20T09:51:18.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What i mean is what mechanics you enjoy over the actual champions.\n\nFor example nidalee is my biggest comfort pick of a champion and probably the one champ i have the most fun on, and she benefits the most from Quick mechanics (the difference between a good and a bad nidalee), and accurate skill shots.","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-20T10:00:43.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=V8MFlWgo,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-20T09:51:18.477+0000)\n>\n> What i mean is what mechanics you enjoy over the actual champions.\n> \n> For example nidalee is my biggest comfort pick of a champion and probably the one champ i have the most fun on, and she benefits the most from Quick mechanics (the difference between a good and a bad nidalee), and accurate skill shots.\n\nIt all comes back to the same thing doe ';> What do i enjoy, i cant find anything usually BUT I keep playing bcz smite isnt better and neither is dota, but i enjoy the genre","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-05-20T14:53:25.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't watch thousands of videos before you play the champion. Maybe just watch one. I don't ever start with watching videos because if the player is really good with the champion this may cause me to place unrealistic expectations with what I can do with that champion. Then you feel disappointed that you didn't do too well for a series of games. I mean you can't win every match but if you focus on mechanically getting better as well as having better awareness, wards and objectives it amplifies that experience.\n\nI like Braum because you can deep ward without feeling like the enemy jungler with 100-0 you. \n\nChampions like Yasuo rely heavily on positioning. With Yasuo you have to constantly be aware of where the minions are and what pathways would be available to reach the enemy target (E). I enjoy that about Yas.\n\nThe only shapeshifting champion I own is Quinn. Her Valor form is a completely different playstyle and needs certain requirements to be effective with. She's an ADC/Assassin.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FideiAngelus","date":"2015-05-20T10:56:03.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're after top lane, I recommend trying out Rumble as he can be quite a lot of fun and can make a huge impact in team fights.
