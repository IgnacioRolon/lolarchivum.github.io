Cho have quite a good sustain in lane and of course that BS true damage ult which scales with ap (meaning the more AP the more true damage).

You can also use your Q to check bushes. A well timed Cho'gath Q can forced a summoner spell from the enemies.  Another suggestion from me is Twisted Fate (although i have never played him b4). Twisted Fate (TF) have an on demand stun on his W (gold card) and he can get mana back from using blue card and he can pressure other lanes very well with his ultimate especially from the mid lane. Another good mid lane champion is Annie (her burst is insane) although she doesn't have a proper escape. Other than that you can try Nunu Ap mid lane although he is not a meta mid lane pick he can snowball pretty hard with an early advantage and his consume gives you pretty good sustain in lane. Fyi nunu's ult have 250% AP scaling ... (u can one shot squishy champs if you can pull of the full channeling)  His E have a 100% Ap scaling but it have quite a long CD tho (around 6 sec).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"darkdraagoon","date":"2015-05-29T07:39:50.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll suggest azir or ziggs due to they r strong and quite easx to play.
