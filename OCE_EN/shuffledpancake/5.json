He is good with Leona because she guarantees him stacks of his passive which is actually quite strong at max stacks as a trade mechanism and realistically I think he's highly viable but he is difficult to play as he needs to stealth engage and enemy traders like Lucian are strong and enemies like Leona etc can shut down his trades so if he isn't against someone who scales less he's in trouble. Tristana can wreck him as she can push waves hard from a distance so he can't do much but farm and her engage is better than his and her ult denies him a lot of time from his ulti if he engages with it.\n\nAll in all, the Botrk suits him nicely, as does Infinity Edge and Phantom Dancer - I'd actually prefer Infinity Edge and Phantom Dancer on him but some team comps call for Blade of the ruined king, or a cutlass early and this gives him nice sustain and he can proc the Blade of the Ruined King on entire teams later with his penetrating attacks from his ultimate but due to his squishy nature he needs farm and if they have junglers like Mundo etc that pressure you into performing early game he's probably not as strong a pick as a good CC'er like Jinx or a poker like Ashe however he is good against Champions with good escape mechanisms because his passive deters re-engages and he can win trades with his stealth engages.\n\nPinks are expensive early game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lauricella3","date":"2015-05-17T11:37:42.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3153}} {{item:3087}} maybe even a {{item:3046}} then mostly AD and armor pen\n\nEdit: Banshee's or GA is a MUST HAVE late game.","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-17T11:57:01.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lauricella3,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=0cVYYVEi,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-05-17T11:37:42.911+0000)\n>\n> {{item:3153}} {{item:3087}} maybe even a {{item:3046}} then mostly AD and armor pen\n> \n> Edit: Banshee's or GA is a MUST HAVE late game.\n\nif this is for twitch then yeah, but trade shiv (late game) for blood thirster/black cleaver and boots for zephyr (unless you prefer boots ofc)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yuudachi","date":"2015-05-17T05:47:00.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-05-17T08:22:31.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Crackdogrock,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=0cVYYVEi,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-05-17T05:47:00.850+0000)\n>\n> Well assassin meta is creeping up AGAIN so maybe\n\nFixed it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"22 5 19 20 1","date":"2015-05-17T07:43:12.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he's not so strong in this current 'league of tanks' meta","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-17T08:14:18.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=22 5 19 20 1,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=0cVYYVEi,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-05-17T07:43:12.565+0000)\n>\n> he's not so strong in this current 'league of tanks' meta\n\nTho he does use botrk, assasin meta plz hopefully it comes along","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2015-05-17T07:00:13.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any AD Carry is 'viable'.
