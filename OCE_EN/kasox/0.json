I&#039;m not the best at ideas but please just make it cool.\r\n\r\nI think if you gave older champions like Cass some really cool skins, it&#039;ll draw more people.\r\n\r\nJust a thought. \r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-18T23:19:07.040+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Swain also hasn't got a skin for 4.5 years, and Karthus _(except for 1 legacy skin, that riot had little control over what champ received it)_ hasn't got a proper skin for 5 years _(Karthus also has NO particle effect changes on any of his skins)_\n\n______\n\nMeanwhile Ezreal has consistently got a skin** every year**, for the last 5 years. \n_2011 was the only year in which he didn't get a skin since he came out._\n\nThere is a serious imbalance here.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-08-20T06:54:05.473+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yorick mori hasn't recived a skin,original splash update or skin updates ever.\nHe was released in early 2011.\n\nhttp://m.quickmeme.com/img/17/17d574c4a623858b5bdb974339b1bc338e4f5e9aed51a3e93cbca17b88299925.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-20T10:09:15.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I rest my case!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-08-20T07:19:17.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People have been talking about who \"deserves\" a skin for years. While, I've long stopped following the growing imbalance, I've always had a feeling that Riot could attempt to capitalise more on champs who have only a few skins but are the current flavour of the month. I was convinced Swain was getting one after the mid season update, then again with Malzahar and now Jhin and Cass. My best guess is that the production process must be more time consuming or scheduled than we can imagine, and that perhaps nothing is even on the drawing board for many champs.","replies":[{"poster":"Kasox","date":"2016-08-25T21:39:23.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm humbly coming to the same sad conclusion.

The skin sets especially have to be selected carefully to fit.\n\n**It has to be viable mechanically.**\n Some skins are harder to make than others, and some champions are harder to make skins for. While they don't seem to have set quotas, they do have technical limitations. Aurelion Sol is a good example of this kind of thing. They waited so long to make a dragon champion lie him because of how severely their tech was limited in that area. Obvs this really only applies to Legendary tier and higher but it's still a consideration.\n\n**What price tier will it fit into?**\nAgain, there's no set quota here, but it seems they like to find a nice balance of skins of all price tiers so there is not only something for everyone, but also so they can still release skins reasonably often. A concept they want to fit into a higher tier may have to wait until some other skin being worked on is finished.\n\n**How old is the champion?\"**\nChamps closer to a VU obviously aren't going to have any skins in development. As to where they define close I couldn't say, but a while back they said Eve wasn't going to get any skins until her VU, though she got one anyway when the VU was shelved. WW would likely be the exception because he has a very simple model and as a 750 skin the work lost in redoing it will be negligible. Really old champs like Yorick and Urgot obvs won't get any until their VUs.\n___\n\nThere's a bit more to it than that, but it's not so easy as \"this champ doesn't have many skins\". On top of technical reasons there are artistic considerations as well. There are plenty of cool ideas out there but they have to be solid enough to make it through the rigorous selection process.","replies":[{"poster":"Kasox","date":"2016-08-25T21:38:07.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the in-depth post.

If we do have a demonic one, it's most likely just gonna be a red firey Cass with red firey animations, which is somewhat cliche now with Demon Vi, Infernal Nasus and Wukong etc\nSomething like metallic Cass would be too much silver unless they were to make her Mecha, Project or Battlecast (do they even do Battlecast now??) which again would be a tad cliche at this stage","replies":[]},{"poster":"BananaSlayerAMO","date":"2016-08-18T23:14:16.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that they should make new skins for her - I think a modern-ish one would be nice for her since the others are hella outdated.","replies":[]}]}
