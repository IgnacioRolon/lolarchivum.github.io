Lee mid A. needs his lanes to do well/very well.. B. get ungodly fed and end the game by 35 mins max.. or C. used to help reduce pressure for his late game hypercarry champs..

For example if a lux were to q auto w auto you, at lvl 1-5 you would lose half your hp with no way to fight back. Unless you q'd into her in which case she will shield auto harass you and kill you with ignite. Same goes for victor azir ect. The reason why you can play some melee such as riven and irelia mid is because they have a way of dealing damage in the safety of a stun and then quickly disengage. If you really wanted to play lee sin mid you would have to put a lot of points into your shield early.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-10-04T11:51:50.498+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're thinking of him the wrong way I think. Lee Sin mid is all about the roaming potential. Like old Kassadin, where you would struggle through the laning phase, and then suddenly at level 6 become a god, get a double bot lane and snowball from there.\n\nThe way Lee Sin mid would work is, by playing very passive and waiting for the wave to reach your side of the lane. Zoning shouldn't be an issue, because generally in mid, zoning your opponent by standing in-front of minions is just asking for a first blood gank. Land Q's for trades whenever you can, but if an opportunity never shows, just use it to get those far away CS. Also now with the new TP mid meta, you could even take TP and have a free back in the laning phase, if you are being harassed too much.\n\nAt level 6 roam bot for an almost guaranteed kill or two. You will have better roams than any mid laner right now, due to your combination of mobility, CC and early game damage. \n\nThe big issue with midlane Lee Sin is the late game fall off. Not even LeBlanc falls off as bad as Lee Sin does late game. This is terrible for a mid laner. It might be possible to transition in to a split-push strategy though, kind of like with Zed.","replies":[{"poster":"Bibimbap","date":"2015-10-06T07:05:26.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My thoughts exactly, though Felsummoner is correct about the trades, sure Lux can Q->AA->E->AA, but if I was able to dodge the Q, and landed a Q of my own, I could go in and potentially win the trade.\nLee Sin's damage falls off late-game, so I've thought about using him as a split-pusher/objective control champion if I play him mid. \n2-man baron's are possible late-game, I can solo dragon, or I can pressure objectives while my team is away doing other things.\n\nAlso, it would put psychological pressure on the enemies, as if I am pinged MIA, they may play much safer, because Lee covers the map pretty quickly with his Q and W.\n\nThe problem with Lee mid, is that if he's pressured too much by someone who can take towers easily, he won't have a chance to gank, otherwise his tower goes down.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-10-06T10:05:17.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh and a good idea while you're low elo is to not go off meta until you understand what you're doing in the game with the champ. You gotta know strengths weaknesses of your champ and all other opponents. Cringeworthy is seeing people go off meta picks. You'll never get better if you just do that.
