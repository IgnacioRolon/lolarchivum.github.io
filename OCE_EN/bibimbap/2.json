I&#039;ve read that Akali counters Yasuo, I just wanted to ask you guys what you think, do you believe Akali is a great counter for Yasuo? Or do you think (assuming the two players are of equal talent) that Yasuo can beat Akali.\r\nI just want to point out, in the link, I started off with about 200 ping, got first blood at 2:50, and then spiked to around 600 ping for the rest of the game, I literally couldn&#039;t move, and had to farm under turrent {{item:3070}} (I still got kills, their Shyv didn&#039;t build tank -yet-). \r\n\r\nAnyway, point being, I was laned mid against an Akali, who couldn&#039;t take advantage of my atrocious ping to benefit her (even after I allchatted my ping about 100 time because I was annoyed). I&#039;m not trying to boast, just want to see what people think. \r\n\r\nAlso, this isn&#039;t the first time I&#039;ve laned up against Akali, I&#039;ve never lost to a single Akali lane yet (hoping to see some good ones!) I&#039;ll mostly always get first blood on them and keep up the pressure, I start E of course, for mobility and harass. \r\nWhat do you guys think? Are these Akali&#039;s just really mechanically bad, or is Yasuo the new counter for Akali?\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re an Akali main, or believe you&#039;re good at her, I&#039;d love to have a 1 v 1, I just want to see if Akali is really Yasuo&#039;s counter, or is http://www.championselect.net/tips/akali/yasuo lying :O","replies":[{"poster":"l2noob4ul","date":"2015-09-23T23:38:12.379+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"akali overall is at a bad spot atm ever since they nerfed her (e can't proc q anymore)\n\nshe used to counter yas by keeping up with mobility and melee which counters yas' movement and windwall, she still does the same things but now that her early game is so much weaker (can't proc q), she can't keep up if both players are equally skilled","replies":[]},{"poster":"ninjaIRL ","date":"2015-09-23T11:35:09.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:2043}}","replies":[{"poster":"Bibimbap","date":"2015-09-24T10:21:46.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly, to me her W is pretty irrelevant, I bang down a pink and voila, I can see her trying to sneak past me.{{summoner:6}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkenedKnight","date":"2015-09-23T12:51:50.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"interesting, i wouldnt have thought akali was a counter to yasou.. I wonder if its pre 6 or post 6 thats she is considered to be a counter.. Considering she gains alot of burst once she hits 6. Either way counter or not i definitely think it comes down to the skill of the player :)","replies":[]}]}
