Sometimes I can enter in the game after 2 or 3 tries, but most of the times it&#039;s about 10 min of boring struggle (when it works), and it ends up with a 20min penalty for being afk...\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve tried everything i found (flushing dns, going in files and renaming some logitech files, trying to put some manual DNS numbers, repairing, re-installing, restarting the laptop...), but so far, nothing. After doing some more research, I read somewhere that my Internet Service Provider (or my rooter, or something related to my IP, or my DNS or som&#039; like that) could cause the issue I&#039;m facing (the ISP I&#039;m using is a local one so I won&#039;t bother you with its name), and so I made a test : I went at my brother&#039;s home, where the ISP there isn&#039;t the same as the one used at my home. It turns out I can login in every single games over there, everything works perfectly!\r\n\r\nSo at this point, I know that either my home&#039;s rooter, or my home&#039;s ISP is in cause here. Unfortunately, my knowledge regarding either of those is quite limited, so I was wondering what could be the next step, in order to be able to play without having to go at my brother&#039;s house. Should I call my ISP? And if so, what should I ask?\r\n\r\nI know this issue is a pretty old one, and that it have been discussed several times already, but I&#039;m quite desperate, and I did check the old topics before... It is because I can&#039;t find what to do, and play the game I like, that I decided to make one of my own.\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to read this, and I&#039;d really appreciate some advice!\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nSam","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-06-06T06:51:09.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you try [manually adding exceptions for league in your firewall](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3) for me, let me know if this helps.","replies":[{"poster":"ujustgothacked","date":"2016-06-06T07:50:31.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi ty for your reply :)\n\nI tried this already, and nothing changed, i still had to reconnect until the loading screen pops up (eventually, or just wait for the game to finish and be considered afk xd ).
