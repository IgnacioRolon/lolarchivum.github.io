I get the league of legends logo, then automatically get the RADS error.. No patcher/launcher is shown.\r\nI have tried the following thing:\r\n- Changed DNS settings to Google&#039;s (8.8.4.4 , 8.8.8.8)\r\n- Flushed DNS\r\n- Added ports into my firewall\r\n- Added game in the firewall\r\n- Disabled firewall\r\n- Disabled antivirus\r\n- Run as Administrator\r\n- Reinstalled game (several times)\r\n- Used windows hard drive check\r\n- Scanned for virus\r\n- Scanned/fixed my whole PC for problems with Tweaking.com&#039;s Windows Repair\r\n- Checked if it&#039;s my ISP (this problem occur on EVERY network.. My other pc works fine)\r\n- Checked the &quot;hosts&quot; file\r\n- And probably more..\r\n\r\nThis is a PC with Windows 7 Professional. It&#039;s a school PC, so it&#039;s part of a domain. The domain can not be the problem because my friends with similar pc&#039;s can play LoL on theirs.. This problem has not occured before..  It&#039;s really getting on my nerves, and support can&#039;t help me either.. Sent them all the files they ask me to send, and still don&#039;t know what my problem is. I can not reset at first because of the domain.. Would remove the domain and thats something I do not want to do right now..\r\n\r\nPlease send me every tip.. I&#039;m really desperate","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-16T23:43:19.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey cheesedoodl,\n\nI'm sorry to hear that you're encountering connection issues to the League of Legends servers.
