It started with a few here and there but the last game i was in was me teamed with 4 bots. being as i rerolled my character, sorry wasted my reroll for a game full of bots, i decided it was time to raise the point. So is anyone else experiencing this? Has RIOT addressed the issue with plans to bring in a report for botting option? I would love to continue to play but if it comes down to me being paired with bots 9/10 games then why would anyone want to continue playing? Any feedback would be great!","replies":[{"poster":"PlayDis","date":"2015-10-02T11:42:00.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol i've never seen a bot in aram","replies":[]}]}
