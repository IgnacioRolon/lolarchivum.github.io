I have mained him for nearly 3 years now, and I'm not just outright defending him, because I am constantly matched against darius myself, and because I know his weaknesses and what champs to pick against him, rarely have I ever actually had trouble fighting him. If you follow what I suggested and picked ranged champions like kennen or jayce, you can outpoke him in lane, deny him cs, and just harass the hell out of him. \n\nEven if you don't like either of those champs, you can play tryn or trundle, rush executioners to stop him from healing, and just ultimately out-damaged him. PLUS even better both tryn and trundles ultimate abilities actually totally screw over darius and his ultimate. I can't tell you the amount of times I've attempted to dunk a tryn or trundle and suddenly tryn is undying and trundle is rapidly gaining back his health and well as extra defences.\n\nEVEN BETTER STILL I can play Fiora against him and dash into him everytime he Q's to prevent him from healing and gaining  a stack as well as rushing lifesteal to overpower him in fights. A big thing that counters darius is LIFESTEAL, because if he can't get you low enough, HE SIMPLY CAN'T DUNK YOU. Rush in as fiora, ult him, and by the time he's gotten 5 stacks off he's either already dead (Because fiora's vitals are fuking nuts) or  you've triggered your ultimate healing and you already have your entire health back.\n\nI can keep going on longer if anyone still wants to tell me that darius can't be dealt with, I may be low elo, I may be bad at some elements of the game, but I'll tell you now, I KNOW DARIUS","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-30T05:05:29.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's all very well to play Kennen or Jayce, but neither of them actually contribute needed stats to the team.\n\nAt my elo, no one picks tanks, so whenever I play top, I am forced to pick a tank so that we can have at least 1.\nI'd love to be able to play Fiora, but if I don't pick Shen or Yorick. The tankiest one on the team will be Fiora... and that'll be a very short game indeed.\n\nAnd seeming Darius is as tanky as most tanks, but does more damage, battles between him and tanks don't end well for the tanks.\n\nThe thing is, Darius doesn't have to wait for you to be low to dunk you, it's just a 'feel good'. In a 1v1 where you don't need resets to continue the fight. You can just ult them as soon as you get 5 stacks. BAM they are now extremely low, and in their panic to get away, they are easy pickings. Unlike Garen or other execute ults, you don't lose damage if you ult too early. So it's not a huge loss if you do.\n\nIm not saying that he is the stupidest champ in the game or anything.\nHe just does too much damage for how survivable he is. _(and he isnt the only one)_\n\nPart of my problem is that I'm a mid laner, and mages vs bruisers is a matchup destined to fail.
