The Dropbear of Doom has already been defeated, however you can still earn points towards your personal tally while waiting for the next battle to start. The next battle will start at midnight (45-50 minutes from when I'm posting this) and will then transition to bonus points on the Howling Abyss (ARAM).\n\nFor the next challenge, you'll need to earn a total of 4 points (across all battles) to get the Hextech Chest and Key that are up for grabs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"elemental cora6","date":"2017-01-29T11:37:21.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok thanks","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-01-29T11:27:11.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you mean which game mode you need to play to contribute points, you can play any mode as long as it isn't \"Coop VS AI\" or \"Custom\", so basically any match made game.
