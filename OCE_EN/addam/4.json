Before any single person comes in and tells me that it its my fault that I lost those games, that may indeed be the case, I of course have things to improve on just like everyone else. Game after game of afk farming junglers, game after game of players ignoring others and throwing leads, game after game of players taking farm from carries because every single person has the mental of a pea. \r\n\r\n\r\nI recently demoted to platinum 3 on the oce server, and for the first time this season i am finding players are not where they  should be. The odd occasional game i would get some players who would make some mistakes and that was okay, and then i would get an equal balance of good players on my team, ones who synergise well and help out team mates. \r\n\r\nWhat is going on, are other players finding this to be the case? I dont understand, why would i want to play ranked with players who DONT WANT TO WIN?","replies":[{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-04-12T00:20:40.455+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"OH, YEAH and s rank making people split off to try farm it up instead of just winning in less than 20mins when they have a huge lead that lets enemy teams catch up or come back 1-7 times -.-","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-04-07T22:36:31.498+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OCE's known to be the troll server I think or most recent server made so youngest gets more noobs maybe, fake accounts trolling, I use to spam for people to leave OCE  with mass green history match histories until somebody kept taking them down, like 2-3 times even though it was just on a free upload website, and I guess you should just run rank with a friend you know wont tilt","replies":[{"poster":"Addam","date":"2019-04-08T05:29:40.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i think duoing is probably the best option hey","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MysticLlama","date":"2019-03-28T20:25:00.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"think of like this... if every player is crap in your games but you are good then that means enemy has 5 crap players and your team had 4!!

But it’s not, most of the games in your elo are lost due to negativity flame which causes teammates to not care and play on autopilot aka crap.... Best thing for you to do is play at a consistently high level and you WILL climb... if you want to boost your chances of winning, encourage your teammates, stop feuds from happening before they happen, don’t whiteknight anyone, don’t gang up on someone, and most importantly, acknowledge your teammates good plays every time... any rank under challenger is just mentality 90%, Skill 10%","replies":[{"poster":"Addam","date":"2019-03-31T08:03:05.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh nice, what rank is your main account?

Such a pretentious thing to say to someone you don't know at all lol? \nLeague of legends is a team game, and you're only as strong as your weakest player. I think there are too many factors that affect just winning a game, and I have noticed, especially as of late (at the time of posting this post) that teams are extremely coin flip; people tilt easier, junglers tend to tunnel for themselves rather than the team, and nobody really cares if they win or lose. Fair enough. This post was literally to just complain for the sake of complaining, and see if other people were experiencing teams playing worse than before. Because that's just it. My teams were great literally a week before, heck the entire season before. And I don't just mean i won more games or anything, even the losses were great. Teammates were making bad decisions, but it was okay. They still did their best. They still played to win and still helped the team out. Nobody afkd or rq. Nobody took farm from others in a rage for doing something silly. It was a grindy ranked, but it was a good ranked. Now it's just annoying man haha.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Addam","date":"2019-04-09T03:39:52.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, my goodness you sound so toxic, what the heck is your problem?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Addam","date":"2019-04-09T03:05:36.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lmao yikes, why are you so triggered?
