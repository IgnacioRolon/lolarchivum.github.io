I&#039;m gold 4 playing with diamond elo players (with and against in different matches) set at silver elo and they always are groups just helping friends climb ladders or something. How is it fair if I continue to match with this one particular group, it should be a reportable offence, and something should be done?","replies":[{"poster":"SlySi","date":"2016-08-02T02:31:10.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you.

There is no real way to stop it, it's just how it is. and with the dynamic queue implant you might as well exploit it, it's pretty much a free win. Ask you're friends to hope on smurfs and just play with them, sure it's not helping solve it but hey. \n\n\"If you can't beat them, join them\" :)","replies":[]}]}
