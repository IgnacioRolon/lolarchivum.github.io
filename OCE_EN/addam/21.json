Now I wasn&#039;t feeding or saying anything to be toxic, but is it fair that I should be punished for my internet just randomly switching off? I then finally fixed my internet and the game was obviously over. I was then placed in a 20 minute waiting queue, and have to wait 20 minutes before every game for 5 more games. I left 2 waiting periods after waiting for 45 minutes, and then restarted the client to see if its just because i needed to update or something. I then went from what i believe to be 1 game, to 5...\r\nNow ive been dealing with poor internet for about a year now, thats why i have such a long waiting period... but i can go months with good internet and then months with bad. \r\n\r\nWhen does it reset?\r\nHow is this fair, and why should i be punished for my poor internet, even after having to deal with this almost 6 months ago?\r\nYes, im basically on here to rant... But couldnt we implement some way in which someone else can join the lobby so its fair then? There are times i have to leave and this is all just too much nowadays... it&#039;s definitely not worth the fucking wait.\r\n\r\nIf there is anything worth discussing that i think i&#039;ll add to this... could there be a game mode where a person can join on  a champion that is already in game that someone has dc&#039;d from for an &#039;x&#039; amount of time? Possibly for players that want to just fill and couldnt honestly care less?\r\nI&#039;m unsure, but honestly like I said, it&#039;s kind of a stupid system in my eyes. Kind of loses the idea of fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2015-12-22T23:47:25.183+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes, it is fair that you should be punished for your internet cutting out.\nyour internet is your responsibility. if it cuts out, that's your fault as far as riot are concerned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2015-12-23T00:49:53.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you with Telstra? Had that problem for a while also, past month. They say its because they are putting in NBN in neighbouring areas. But I find that if I completely disconnect my cables from the phone lines, and wait 30 mins, then plug them back in, when the internet comes back on it usually doesn't disconnect for a while.","replies":[{"poster":"Addam","date":"2015-12-23T03:50:45.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually am.

Sure there was nothing you can do, and it was not something that you could have foreseen. But a problem from your side ruined other players game, therefore you will be punished. I know it is harsh and i do understand where you are coming from but the system has to be like this so people cannot just leave and get unpunished for whatever reason they left.","replies":[{"poster":"Addam","date":"2015-12-23T03:49:15.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"alright sure, it is unfair for other players, i get that... hence why i have said, maybe there should be something else done so that other players arent inconvenienced by somebody who has horrible internet or has super emergencies and such. At the end of the day, it's still just a game... \n\ni was just curious as to what you guys think could be done to help out the team if somebody leaves. DOTA has the ability to control other characters and a pause button in order to wait for friends, and if they dont return the game is abandoned. I feel like the severity of the punishment can be so unfair sometimes that you kinda cant win ever","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Addam","date":"2015-12-22T15:43:41.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, maybe a bloody warning to say, 'if you abandon this next game, you will be placed in low priority queue for 'x' amount of games. \nYou need 'x' amount of games in order to refill you leaving meter' ? no?","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-12-22T22:34:41.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does say that....","replies":[{"poster":"Addam","date":"2015-12-23T03:46:01.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"where? last times its happened to me it hasn't??","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Headsh0t","date":"2015-12-22T23:40:57.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you with dodo?
