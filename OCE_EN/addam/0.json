Now my elo for twisted treeline is beyond low, but umm what. Do i have to play with friends to play this stupid game type? I thought it was just for fun like an aram or something","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2017-02-16T08:58:23.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a normal queue on tuesday and wednesday, and a ranked queue on thursday and friday. \n\nIMO it needs to be a bit more obvious in the client as I have had many games where people weren't aware it was in ranked mode. \n\nYour last game you were with a level 30 (likely just trying out the game mode not realising it was ranked), yourself and a silver 4. Enemy team had 2 silvers and a level 30. Ranked matchmaking on TT likely isn't going to be as stable as we would like it, due to not many people being aware of its existence or many people playing one of the other 5ish queues available. \n\nYou can always play with friends, or choose to play on one of the normal nights so your MMR doesn't tank.","replies":[{"poster":"Addam","date":"2017-02-16T09:25:42.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i must have read something wrong somewhere, thank you for the reply :)","replies":[]}]}]}
