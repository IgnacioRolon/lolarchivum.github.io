This is the number that is responsible for matching you up with players that are around your skill level or in the case of MMR the same number as you to make sure that each game is with players around your level of skill.\n\nSo what the system does is it takes your MMR and it uses that to give you a bit of a starting point as to where that number will now be coming into the new season. Riot hasn't released the official numbers as to how this works but with some speculation people think that things are balanced around the silver 5-3 rankings. So in the case of being higher than these ranks your MMR will be dragged down closer towards it for your starting MMR and if you are lower your MMR will be dragged up a bit. \n\nWhat happens after this is you play your placement matches and how you play in these heavily effect where you will be placed at the start of the season. Often players feel like they are placed in places where they feel like they don't belong and this is very normal for a lot of people. However with this being in place the way it is you can know that if you belong in the elo you were at last season, you can climb back to the rank that you were to keep going with your climb. \n\nI believe that the rank soft reset each year is to make sure that once players have climbed to where they can and tried their best until they hit a wall and need to improve is to give everyone a starting point at the beginning of the year. (Which is a reason why I think that they choose to do it at the end of the year this time so everyone is evened out where they are supposed to be around to close to the start of the year). Once you get to that rank soon where you can no longer climb you can now set your goal for the year in ranked knowing your new starting point.\n\nAlways keep in mind that this is purely your starting point for the season, and not your final ranking. If you want to have a bit more of a look into how ranked works you can read the [FAQ about it on Riot's support site here.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ) \n\nI hope this helps with understanding why the soft ranked reset is the way it is in my opinion. Good luck in solo queue mate along with your climbing and I hope you reach your ranked goal in 2017. I will see you around.\n\n~Elam","replies":[]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2016-12-22T15:02:55.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Riot is basically retroactively fucking everyone's Ranking because Dynamic Queue put people basically a tier above where they should be (aka dynamic queue boost) and it made it really fucking hard for solos to climb.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2016-12-23T04:28:55.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ABlueQuaker,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=ExXwn9wY,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-12-22T15:02:55.143+0000)\n>\n> Riot is basically retroactively fucking everyone&#x27;s Ranking because Dynamic Queue put people basically a tier above where they should be (aka dynamic queue boost) and it made it really fucking hard for solos to climb.\n\nThis has nothing to do with and even contradicts what OP is saying/inquiring, but okay?","replies":[]}]}]}
