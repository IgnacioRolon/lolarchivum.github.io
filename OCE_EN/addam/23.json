So of course sorry if this has already been said a million times. Correct me if i'm wrong, but does oce even have a tribunal? I have literally played 4 ranked games in a row, where there has been an afk/and or a troll. I didn't play yesterday, because the day beforehand, there were 3 afks in a row. I get in my promos, and think hell yeah, i'll finally go up, but i get another afk. Now, I myself am not in a high division. I'm just in Bronze 3. But every god damn time I try and leave this division I literally can't because of these toxic players. Normally I wouldn't care, and normally I would just shrug it off. But this needs to change. I feel so helpless playing games. I literally don't want to play league any more because of this stuff. Like what can I even do? Report them? Reporting doesn't do anything in OCE. Far out. Do something.","replies":[{"poster":"Bishamon","date":"2015-01-16T23:34:36.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just carry yourself out. Its honestly not the teams fault. if you win lane and stomp hard. then go help other lanes. if you cant get out of bronze its because you arent at the level of leaving. its that simple. i was in bronze 5 too. now im platinum. =/ just improve yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"Addam","date":"2015-01-17T11:08:07.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See, you don't quite understand fellow. Hate to sound like a broken record, but I know for a fact that I don't belong in this rank. I haven't played a lot of ranked, maybe 60 or so, and the first 50 was coming back after not playing for months. The fact of the matter is, I do duo with my friends, and we both generally do well. It's quite hard to carry yourself out, when your mid and/or bot finish with 2/19/5 or something (and i kid you not, 3 games in a row, stuff like this) and then afk. I know I can carry myself out, but not with things like this. It's so unfair.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"godsmustbecrazy3","date":"2015-01-16T16:28:09.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They have been RIOT server fruckups recently, firewall bug, it is not your team mates fault. Just start duo queuing , one less troll or afks or disconnects problems. Thats how you rank higher in Oceania. In NA it is easy to get to silver 4 or higher. But Oceania ranked is like a lottery ticket roll. Your skills means nothing, LUCK is all that matters.\n\nSolutions:\n1 Switch to NA and rank quicker and forget the broken Oceania ranked system\n2 Start duoquing with a good player in Oceania\n3 Quit ranked for a while and play only when u r not angry, frustrated, sleepy or lagging. Basically play only when you feel truly confident after playing normals. Confidence brings in Luck. This is what I learned in Oceania. \n4. Start a fresh account and level to 30 and play ranked again. Since you fall in bronze queue rut, it takes tremendous gold 1+ skills to rank higher but when you start fresh your chances of luck increases. And you might be able to use the experience you got before from playing ranked and do better than last time. And therefore you get higher MMR straight away and you will queued with less troller and afk. \n5. Wait for 2015 soft ranked resets.\n6. The system also matches you with feeders, trolls and afker if you are one of them. Althoguh Riot I won't admit it but its very true. So try to have 0 deaths, don't surrender or go afk or stop ragaing and trolling and raging if you are doing them.\n\nMany NA pro challengers don't play ranked in Oceania except for chilling and they don't play seriously. And they do that for a simple reason and that is Oceania ranked is so completely broken. Ask nigtblue3 and iamcutiepie if you don't believe me. :)  Good Luck mate and wish you all the success in life  :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-16T10:10:12.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though this happens I still got out of bronze and into silver.
