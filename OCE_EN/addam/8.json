Syndra's ultimate does not apply a slow, or a stun, or a root, etc. therefore QSS won't (and shouldn't) work against it. On the other hand, Malzahar's ultimate applies a suppress, which means you can use QSS. But even though you remove the suppress, you are still going to be hit with the damage. *All QSS does is negate CC; it is not a spell shield, therefore will not negate damage*.\n\nIf you want a spell shield (completely negates Syndra's ult), you either want to play Morgana (or have one on your team), buy *Edge of Night* (if AD), or buy *Banshee's Veil* (if AP).\n\nI hope this help :)\n\nThanks :D\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2017-08-24T07:37:30.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uh i think you're missing his point.\nHis point is when a Syndra starts to snowball there is no stopping her from pressing R for 40-100% of your hp, there is nothing you can do to stop her ultimate apart from obviously zhonyas, but this leaves out AD champs, edge of night is a bad item due to the countdown for the shield and it only lasting a few seconds. banshees is easily broken before she would even want to press R so that's also not a viable purchase. (apart from the magic resist components lowering her damage) \n\nWith all that said & done, I believe Syndra is okay where she is, learn the champion & her weaknesses, play accordingly. Could say much the same with other snowbally lane bullies, as annoying as it is getting hit by an ability that isn't a skillshot for 40-100% of your maximum hp, it is balanced. There's a reason Syndra isn't a big pick in LCS/LCK etc. \n\nLet tanks mow her down & stay out of her range. Goodluck in your future games vs Syndra :P \n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ocelotelot","date":"2017-08-24T06:11:13.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"buy zhonyas or however you spell it, counters her r ezpz","replies":[]}]}
