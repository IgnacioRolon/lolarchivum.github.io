I&#039;m currently level 5, and know that they drop on summoners rift normal and ranked game types, as well as dropping for mastery level 6 between S+ and S-. I was keen to get rank 6 haha. \n\nHere's my game: http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/182044491/200040788?tab=overview\n\n\nEdit: I went to screencap the picture of my grade, however i&#039;ve noticed that grades aren&#039;t showing for a number of my games?\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-08-10T08:57:27.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same has happened to me. S+ in every game this patch, but nothing in the EoG screen. What's worse is that those scores aren't being added to my Mastery Points (*insert the sound of tearing my own hair out*).\n\nI have messaged Riot, though, and they were pretty nice:\n\n > I am really sorry you had to deal with this D: I can't provide a timeline for when we might see a fix on this issue, but thank you again for the report. This is a pretty big deal and we will definitely be focusing on fixing this.","replies":[{"poster":"Addam","date":"2017-08-10T09:42:49.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh wow, so not just me!
