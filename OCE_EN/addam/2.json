I was then blocked for purchasing too much RP, which I have no problem with, however it then glitched out again and took 3 days to fix, and now that i am finally able to purchase RP again, the bundle is finished. Feeling very cheated, very cheated indeed.","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-08-09T21:45:49.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you sure you purchased the \"Project Strike Augment + Bundle\" and not the \"Project Strike Augment Bundle\"?\n\nIf you purchased the first bundle did you check your Hextech Hub?\n\nIf you did and it's not there;\n\nGet in touch with Riot’s [Billing & Store Support Centre.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=4584)\n\n* The primary category is already chosen. \n\n* Under the secondary select **Billing & Store.**\n\n* For the tertiary category select **RP Purchase Errors.**\n\n\nhttp://lolwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Debonair-Ezreal.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Addam","date":"2016-08-10T07:08:11.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks for replying, yeah I did actually purchase the correct bundle, i've looked online and heard that a lot of people missed it too.
