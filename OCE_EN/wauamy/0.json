I tried to uninstall and download again but I can't open the client at all. (Windows 7)\nI get the RAD error, and I tried downloading League on another pc (windows 8) but the pvp.net patcher kernel has stopped working pops up on it. Maybe it's a new bug or technical issue from the new patch? Cause it's weird that both pcs of mine do not work when one pc I have always used to play and it worked fine till today and the new pc doesnt work at all.\n\nEdit: I asked my brother about it and he experienced this before and helped me fix my problem. I used this method on my windows 7, haven't tried my windows 8 pc yet.\n\nThe DNS method works where you go to your network settings and go to properties of the internet protocol version 4. Then you press - use the following DNS address : 8 . 8 . 8 . 8 (didnt need to do the other alternate like everybody else). I applied these settings and run the client and it worked. \nHope it works for you too.","replies":[]}]}
