This player does not receive any rewards at the end of the game but this gives the rest of the team a better chance to win. \r\n\r\nAfter pressing this button, the player agrees that he/she will not be able to join any games for double the duration of the full game.\r\nIf the player decides not to switch their champion over to AI, then they get marked as leaving and get the appropriate penalties. \r\n\r\nWould much appreciate some feed back and thoughts on how to improve this idea so please leave the comments below.","replies":[{"poster":"Agridilith","date":"2014-12-09T08:38:34.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if someone quits though\nai would be batter than not having that champion","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-11-30T14:04:17.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"An afk is better than an AI.
