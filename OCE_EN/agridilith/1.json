I myself am now back to 0LP after going on a major losing streak. \n\nAfter Looking back at my games, I have noticed one crucial pattern that could change this.......\n\nThe people I am versing are absolute douche bags who troll ranked queues. \n\nI get that lanes get ganked and all but to get 5 man ganked bot under our tower at lv. 3? Did we do something wrong? We were&#039;nt over extended. We hadn&#039;t got any kills. We were not ahead in cs. So what did we do wrong? \nApparently, based on the info these players have told me in the last 10 instances of this happening, 5v1 is normal? \"Team game\" they all cry when you ask what they are doing. I cannot think of any *team game* that allows you to 5v1, can anyone else? \n\nThe answer is quite simple. Ranked is not a healthy environment for anyone to play. \n\nCan anyone else relate? Or am I correct in believing that Riot hates me for some unforeseen reason?","replies":[{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2017-04-12T10:23:42.537+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to oce league where no one cares about punishment because it takes 10 sec to create a new account to troll again!\n\nGG Riot!","replies":[]},{"poster":"atroquinine","date":"2017-04-12T09:11:41.361+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"this is bait right? youre complaining that people are playing to win in ranked?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Agridilith","date":"2017-04-12T11:15:03.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bait for what? I'm not saying that they aren't playing to win. i'm just trying to find out all the the cancerous, plain right dog ways people are doing so in an effort to maybe figure out a way to counter them. I'm just sick of not being able to do anything in ranked cos a team decides to do some stupid 12vie move like 5v1 at lv 1.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Agridilith","date":"2017-04-17T16:25:24.803+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":1,"body":"I also feel like the population is getting worse and worse. People decide to go 2 man top or mid a lot now. Sure, break the meta and all but don't do it then call the player shit cos they are down.
