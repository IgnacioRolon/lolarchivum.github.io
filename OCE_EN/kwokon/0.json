I went through the big memory dump process and it told me to share the above file with the _development team_. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure what this is or what it means, but it occured during a ranked match (Oct 6 2018, 11:37 AM), which meant after the game ended (it was a remake) I lost 18 lp. \r\nI attempted to reconnect multiple times, with the same error message occuring.\r\n\r\nI'm mostly concerned about the lp lost, which is a little fustrating. \r\n\r\n\r\nAny help to solve this would be amazing, I did find multiple youtube videos expressing different methods to fix this (I'm wanting to know if these are safe to follow), and mainly to regain the lost lp.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nkwokon\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEV-kkumKBE\r\n^ is this video safe to follow as a fix?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-06T07:14:26.203+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Has the problem persisted in subsequent games?\n___\n\nTrying some of the steps in this article (particularly the updates) may well solve your issue.\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes\n___\nIf none of those resolve your issue, submit a ticket to Player Support and include that file (there will be a spot to drag and drop that file).\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"kwokon","date":"2018-10-06T12:15:16.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the relpy\n\n\nI reckon I've fixed it following the instructions in the video I linked to (I've only tested in training mode to see if it works), but I think its all good now.\n\nMy main concern is the lp I lost for it, I just feel its unfair to lose lp for an issue that was outside my control.\n\nIf you know anyway I could retreive the lost lp, that would be great\n\n\nThanks,\nkwokon","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-06T13:28:53.235+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There isn't. Even on Riot's side there isn't any way to add or remove LP from an account, because it causes far more problems than it fixes. Ignoring abuse cases, even a small manual change in your LP would badly affect your matchmaking and your LP calculation for many games after.\n\nBasically, the cost of such a thing would be far higher than the few extra games you have to play to restore the LP on your own.","replies":[{"poster":"kwokon","date":"2018-10-06T20:57:02.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"okay if thats the case, theres no problem.\n\nThanks so much for all your help","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-07T03:55:25.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry there isn't a more satisfying solution.
