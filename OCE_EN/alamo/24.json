Pretty much any ADC champ on mid is a hipster pick. Or doomed. If you want a really uncommon pick, try bard, as his arrival was overshadowed by Ekko, and now I rarely see him being used any more. Maybe bard jungle?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-06T09:32:54.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Taric. Any role.\n\nJungle taric is actually really strong.
