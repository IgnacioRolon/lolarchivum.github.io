Idol of Durand can&#039;t be cancelled by movement commands for the first 0.25 seconds of its duration if it strikes at least one enemy champion.\r\n\r\nWhen the channel ends, Galio bursts out of his statue form and deals magic damage to nearby enemies, increased by 10% for each basic attack he received while channeling, up to a maximum 80% increase. If the channel is canceled or interrupted, Galio deals magic damage in a smaller radius.\r\nMINIMUM MAGIC DAMAGE: 200 / 300 / 400 (+ 60% AP)\r\n「 BONUS MAGIC DAMAGE PER HIT: 20 / 30 / 40 (+ 6% AP) 」\r\n\r\nLORE\r\n\r\nLong before the League&#039;s regulation of such magic, mages experimented with the creation of artificial life. Now forbidden, instilling golems with reason was once not so uncommon a practice amongst the more expert of craftsmen. One such visionary was the Demacian artificer, Durand. Peerless at crafting sentient beings, Durand&#039;s constructs served as tireless guardians for the border towns of his beloved city-state, affording them protection from their Noxian neighbors. For his own defense, however, Durand kept his magnum opus: Galio. This mighty construct forged in the image of a gargoyle kept him safe on his journeys, allowing him to perform his important work without fear of reprisal from those hostile to his homeland. That is, until dealing with his taxing sentinels finally roused the ire of the Noxian High Command.\r\n\r\nAs Durand crossed the Howling Marsh with his masterwork in tow, he was set upon by Noxian assassins in force. Outnumbered and overwhelmed, Galio looked on in horror as the murderers cut down his charge, executing him swiftly before vanishing back into the mists. Stripped of his reason for being, Galio despaired. For years he remained in solitude, standing vigil over the bones of the master he had failed to protect... a literal monument to his own everlasting shame. Then, on one nondescript day, a sad but determined Poppy yordle girl carrying a mighty Demacian crown stopped in the shadow of a great statue to rest. Hidden in plain sight from his unsuspecting visitor, Galio studied the forlorn yordle. She looked as though she too shouldered a tremendous burden. As quietly and as stoically as she had arrived, she departed in the direction of Demacia. This encounter lit a spark in Galio&#039;s eye. Remembering the cause that his master had died defending, Galio arose from his silent purgatory and followed in the wake of this brave creature. He had a new reason to live: to join the League of Legends and fight for the will of Demacia.\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nCOMPLETELY ORIGINAL champion I just thought up","replies":[{"poster":"LoliConnoisseur","date":"2015-11-03T05:40:50.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh very original, I'm most impressed, very detailed, one would say riot thought of this themselves.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-10-27T13:20:53.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That passive...\n\nRiot please never add this champ to the game\n\n\n-------\nWTF RIOT WHAT DID I TELL YOU WHY DID YOU DO IT THIS TIME","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-10-23T03:59:53.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh wait he already was a champion?\n\ni never seen him b4","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-10-23T01:39:25.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good news dude!
