Normally ganking mid is pretty difficult to set up. With taric you just walk in and press e. I used this method once against a zed and forced his flash every single time it was up then took another jungle camp before returning for the kill. As a jungler I keep this guy as a pocket pick against mostly AD teams because of his Armour Aura. This guy is actually extrememly viable in the current jungle even more so than in the support role in my honest opinion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-07-16T23:35:56.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The stun is gud, cause the stun is longer than u'd think, so the ganks are very affective!\nAlso his health is very well an advantage in the ally team.\nTried out leona jg, it works well, if u can land ur E :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-07-16T23:09:53.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The clear and early ganks are pretty good and it's better than most people would probably think. Lategame kinda sucks unless the whole enemy team is diving into you though because he only has a single target cc and cant get even get in range for it half the time (the same reason support taric isn't very popular). I'd definitely put a Righteous glory into your build somewhere to help catch up to people.","replies":[]}]}
