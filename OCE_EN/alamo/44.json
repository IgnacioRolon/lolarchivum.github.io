This can take a lot of practice to get right maybe 5 games or so but it is soo worth it. She can be a total monster all game and is super fun to play once you have mastered her! later on in the game you can chose to play her more of an assassin or more tank depending on the items, as an assassin you can easily jump into the back lines and just use your w and autos to do massive damage to the squishes. using the short cool down on your q and max level to jump between skill shots and cc and onto targets that are running away. as a tank you can from a solid front line and destroy their front line with your true damage while poking back their damage dealers with your ult. there are many more things you can do with her, and I think the best way is to spend some time leaning her then just try you best and you will usually come off better. have fun :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2015-06-14T05:16:26.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Each use of R procs Trinity Force so if you are not spamming at range or spamming for heals consider spacing out the uses in between autos.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-13T10:24:27.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> refund.
