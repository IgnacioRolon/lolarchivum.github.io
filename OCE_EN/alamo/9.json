Why do you think Bronze people don't get borders LOL\n\nBut seriously, learn the game more than just \"kill people\".\n\nFor me, split-push Nasus got me from Bronze 2 to Silver 3 when I first started playing ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-09-09T09:24:34.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BarryButcher,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=AfEvqa8O,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-09-09T03:14:27.287+0000)\n>\n> Learning ANY champion to a competent level will get you out of Bronze.\n> \n> \"real\" ranked doesn't actually begin til Silver.

I understand you might be good but you cant carry your team when you get 2 afk's every promo. Too many trolls that's why I find it easier to duo queue with someone so then you know you have 2 people to try carry if you get trolls","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-09-09T10:44:47.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agree with BarryButcher. It really just depends on your play style and preferred lanes (although if you're playing ranked, you should have at least a couple of champs mastered for each lane). I got to Silver with Blitz/Thresh support, and Cho/Warwick jungle.","replies":[]}]}
