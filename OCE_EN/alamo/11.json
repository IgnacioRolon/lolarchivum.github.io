I could have an item with 120 AD that I can activate to deal a small percentage of damage as well as increase all physical damage the target recieves by 50%, how do I know that is truly bad unless it's observed? Items should not be balanced within a vacuum, just like champions shouldn't.\n\n\nThey should be more proactive though. WoW releases hotfixes for broken stuff when they need to, rito patches whenever they feel like it, and stupid ass things like cinderhulk or Luden's Echo triggering the chain effect but causing the max amount of chain damage to be recieved by one target if there only was one will continue to happen for weeks.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-05-18T09:43:28.295+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=noogai,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=tqeEEpcQ,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-05-18T09:37:29.265+0000)\n>\n> You see, that's wrong. \n> \n> They need to make updates to both items AND champions at the same time, otherwise stupid shit like cinderhulk will become rampant.\n\nCinderhulk is hardly BS if you have seen the terror that was Feral Flare.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-05-18T13:01:56.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=tqeEEpcQ,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-18T09:43:28.295+0000)\n>\n> Cinderhulk is hardly BS if you have seen the terror that was Feral Flare.\n\nGood times","replies":[]},{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-05-18T09:59:14.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't jungle at the time that was out, nor did I even know how to play properly back then.
