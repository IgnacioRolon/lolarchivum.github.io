But I rarely see either so I don't really know. Probably Jayce is better for poking in lane and Rumble's a capable jungler from what I can tell.","replies":[{"poster":"Sobriquet","date":"2015-07-17T01:35:19.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really?

I baited Zed as Xerath to the bush after I started pitying the poor Rumble jungle who camped there for a whole level. I died before he could get into his tiny flamethrower thingy range and did 0 damage. Then he never banked my lane ever again and ended up doing very little other than annoy me about blue buff.\n\nJungle monsters never run champ abilities so I assume he'd have a good camp clear","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-07-17T09:26:51.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"#rumbleinthejungle","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-17T00:25:25.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jayce is more of a mid laner (poke/burst)\n\nRumble is more of a top laner (sticky, off-tank, that can zone)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Legends man1","date":"2015-07-16T11:43:42.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what ive seen, Jayce is really poke reliant and once he's poked you down he jumps in with hammer stance and usually kills you. He seems to be a burst champion and not sustained damage (this is just what ive noticed from players at my level, not very descriptive sorry but this is what I saw). \n\nRumble on the other hand is sustained damage with his flamethrower thing. His ult is a DoT and zoning tool and yeah he has a movespeed+shield buff which kinda indicates he's more of a stick to your opponent and kill them sorta dude. \n\nI havent played either champ but this is what i gather from playing against them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-07-16T10:04:23.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main top and mid so if you can compare them through those areas that would be nice.","replies":[]}]}
