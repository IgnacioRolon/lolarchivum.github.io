I&rsquo;ll have you know I reached top of the ladder in season 5, and I&rsquo;ve been involved in numerous secret ddos attacks on streamers, and I have over 300 confirmed pentakills. I am trained in lasthitting and I&rsquo;m the best Talon in the entire OGN. You are nothing to me but just another stack. I will wipe you the fuck out with skillshots the likes of which have never been seen before on this elo, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with flaming me in all-chat? Think again, bronzie. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of subscribers across Korea and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the ddos, noob. The ddos that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your mmr. You&rsquo;re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that&rsquo;s just with my autoattacks. Not only am I extensively trained in jungle invades, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the League of Legends skin shop and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the Summoner&#039;s Rift, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little &ldquo;secured&rdquo; killsteal was about to bring down upon you, maybe you wouldn&#039;t have wasted your fucking ult. But you couldn&rsquo;t, you didn&rsquo;t, and now you&rsquo;re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. gg easy, noobs.","replies":[{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-23T00:31:07.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol took me 5 min to make it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-06-22T04:06:01.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you spent even half the effort you did making this on improving yourself you've be at least Gold IV.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-06-22T01:30:07.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">reached top of the ladder in season 5,\n\nThe threat auto fails when people read this part.\n\nReplace that with \"been living on he top of the ladder ever since season 1\" or something.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-22T01:34:32.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"yea i failed that","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-22T01:19:27.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is a joke, no offence intended.","replies":[]}]}
