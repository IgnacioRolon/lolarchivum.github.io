Kids think too much about their rank and not about the game at hand. They focus on the feeders in their team, instead of what they can do to help the team.\nThe worst ones are those that can't handle good logic given to them and talk shit to you.\n\nFor example a team has 3 low champions after a teamfight, a support, adc, and top laner. The opposition has a fed Gangplank who is half health. Someone calls out \"RUN!!!!\", and I'll say \"FIGHT! You can't run from a gangplank!\". What happens? They all die, he hunts them down one by one. Then a salty player says \"stfu noob! Report!\" instead of actually taking the advice. Happens so often. Advice is not toxicity. But kids just have too big an ego to handle advice. \"I've never been wrong in my life ever!\" mentality, probably because they've always had things sugar coated for them. Wake up! This is reality! You will lose sometimes, you will be wrong sometimes. Don't flame because you are wrong! Improve.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-25T05:39:27.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it's like that.\n\nThe best we could do is not taking the generic everyday insults like \"uninstall\" or \"XXX feeder\" too seriously. And if it does get too out of hand (ie personal attacks, severe harassment and all that nasty stuff), just tank it, and report later on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2017-01-25T05:38:26.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you re getting told that you are feeding, then chances are, you are probably feeding. Now i don't like being called a feed as much as the next guy, but every death you have is a mistake, that's one thing you can improve on, if you are playing for it to be casual and not hyper competitive, play normal games, ranked is there for the specific reason of being competitive, so if people are angry that you are feeding, its because they want to climb. You don't like being flamed, but i can guarantee you that you have flamed people in ranked before too. literally focus on not dying for a while, play like a bitch, dont make flashy play that have a 5% chance of actually working, play to your skill level.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-01-25T06:02:39.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I would actually prefer someone to AFK if they are feeding, at least then an auto ban system will hit them.","replies":[]}]}
