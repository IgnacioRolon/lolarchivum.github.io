It took 20s > 30s now, thank you for the harder sight control riot.\r\n\r\nStrategy Diversity : break the record, have you ever nerfed any spell range in 150? nope? good we have the record now.\r\n\r\nFor a fiddle player who played 5000 matches with him, I find it the nerf came so quick and hard, I probably drop from master to plat.\r\n\r\nI have been doing fiddle all role since S4, now I think there is no way I can lane again.\r\n\r\n I hope all your riot's D reduce to teemos' length right after.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-12T02:05:05.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Spectral Fiddlesticks looked ridiculous.

The nerf to fiddle's tether range is horrendous. He was in a good spot. The tether range was increased by 50 to make up for nerfing fiddles fear by over a second, lets not forget that. Two patches ago, fiddle crows were changed in such a way to make his laning ability lower, his passive was also nerfed. After the patch a few weeks back he dropped from 55% winrate (what kat is now) to 51%. And then you nerfed him again. 51% for teamfight champion was balanced.
