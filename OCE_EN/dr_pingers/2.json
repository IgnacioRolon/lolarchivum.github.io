My friend won 1 game and had a bad kda every game and dragged his team down and got bronze 1? What is this Riot? Thats dodgy guys. Honestly last year i won 5 out of 10 games in my provisionals and got silver 5. I dont understand how a player that won 8 games gets bronze 2 and a player that wins 1 gets bronze 1? Please explain. Btw i play supp if that helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-01-23T23:53:53.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's all got to do with MMR, not rank. You can be Silver 5 and still have the MMR of low bronze. It also works the other way, you can be Silver 5 and have the MMR of mid/high silver.","replies":[{"poster":"Deche","date":"2015-01-25T02:29:15.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot took your rank into concideration this time.","replies":[]}]}]}
