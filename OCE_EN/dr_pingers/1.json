My friend won 1 game and had a bad kda every game and dragged his team down and got bronze 1? What is this Riot? Thats dodgy guys. Honestly last year i won 5 out of 10 games in my provisionals and got silver 5. I dont understand how a player that won 8 games gets bronze 2 and a player that wins 1 gets bronze 1? Please explain. Btw i play supp if that helps.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-24T10:37:22.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You rank is not determined by how many games you win during your placements.  Instead he ranks determined by the MMR of the opponents you verse. \n\nUnfortunately this is uncontrollable by you.
