I Managed to get Hextech Annie, Blackfrost Anivia, Gentlemen Cho, Magnificent Twisted Fate, and Rek sai (All permanents). I also got Eternum Nocturne and Spirit Guard Udyr shards but disenchanted them as I already own them. I managed to get Hextech Annie by getting a shard and crafting her with essence, this was about 5 chests into my 20.\n\nWhat have you guys managed to get so far?\n\n*Edit\nI couldn't help myself and got ten more chests. Managed to get Forecast Janna and Championship Kalista permanents (the skin I was aiming for) as well as Aurelion Sol and Bard permanents. I also recieved SSW Talon and Warlord Shen shards which I have now turned into permanents as well and the only remaining champion for me to acquire now is Illaoi!\n\n**Edit 2\nFor easter I got some RP from my partner, out of the 20 more chests I purchased I managed to get Final Boss Veigar, Corporate Mundo permanents. I also rerolled multiple crappy skins into Marauder Alistar and Silverfang Akali and I also rerolled three champ shards for my last champ!","replies":[{"poster":"azgalore","date":"2016-04-26T23:47:11.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just got hextech annie {{champion:1}} randomly after 5-6 chest i got for free sadly i don't have enough stuff to make it permanent yet lol, if i rent it just to see how it look can i still buy it after or it goes away need to know don't want to lose it lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"somebodysafool","date":"2016-04-04T10:33:36.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I opened 140 chests and I only get 4 gemstone...
