This name has always been my go to ign for all games. Now I have been playing league since season 1 and have wished for this name the entire time and just sort of took it on the chin that it wouldn&#039;t be possible. At the start of season 4 I took a pretty big break and after returning I noticed that the person with &quot;Suker&quot; on the Oceanic server still was level 5 and still had no matches in his match history.\n\nI&#039;m Just wondering is there any chance of clearing his name or anything that can be done? Since it is a completely inactive account and simply made so others (I&#039;m assuming I would be the only one chasing this name) couldn&#039;t claim the name.\n\nCheers, \n\n\nSukerMe","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-20T06:14:30.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey SukerMe,\n\nSummoner names are regularly cleaned up for use. Each player gets 6 months at levels 1-6 before their name is cleaned up due to inactivity, and 1 additional month per level after that. If the player is level 5 then his name will be available 6 months after his last match. If you are unable to select the name with a name change then he probably played but the match simply isn't showing; if you need assistance with the name change (such as verifying he was inactive but you still can't take the name) please submit a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they'll help you out.\n\nFor more information on the Summoner Name Cleanup, read here; https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751914-Summoner-Name-Clean-Up-\n\n-DTN","replies":[{"poster":"Suker","date":"2016-02-20T07:01:58.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your reply. One quick question, So do I have to purchase a name change and then attempt to choose \"Suker\" to see if it is available to be claimed? Is that the only way of finding out?","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-20T07:52:31.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went to check and it looks like you already changed your name :3","replies":[]}]}]}]}
