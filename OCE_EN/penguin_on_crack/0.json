For those of you who don&#039;t know what that is it&#039;s just simply someone who made an account and downloaded third party bot software to play for them and level them up so they can sell or use the accounts for whatever. What I am saying is this needs to be solved, I always report them under intentionally feeding and cheating then type &quot;is a bot account&quot; I just really hope riot is actually doing something to stop these accounts because they are damn annoying. I am basically only typing this because in the game I just played of intermediate bots my entire team were bots which is a bit messed up in my opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, sincerely, Penguin on Crack","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-01-01T04:32:07.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They definitely ban bots when they find them, but they simply are hard to catch sometimes.
