PLEASE READ RIOT","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hello fellow players. After the hype of the season resetting today I decided to get into my placement matches. Keep in mind last season I finished in bronze 3. All is look good i&#039;m up 8 games with 0 losses. The next two games I play I Win, therefore meaning I have won all 10 of my placement games. This is where my problem lies. I spend like 5 minutes thinking before I press the continue button wishing I get high silver or even gold 5. However it came to my attention that I was wrong, by a large margin. I was placed into bronze 5... I won 10 games... Just think for a second, i slaved away all day today playing ranked in 35 degree heat in melbourne to not only be hurt by this rank but to be heartbroken. Im still going to play this game but I am very dissappointed in this, I want to know why i was placed in this rank and also wondering if am able to be promoted to atleast silver.  \nMy In game name: Finnster\nThanks\n\nWin 10/10 placements and get b5. I may aswell just throw them all and ill still get b5.","replies":[{"poster":"Just a Smurf","date":"2016-01-20T08:48:51.925+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have checked this guys stats and his does not deserve to be appointed into Bronze 5. This ranking system needs to be correctly changed to suit the ability of the player rather than demote them to a lower rank for smashing out 10/10 wins. Should be guaranteed silver at least!","replies":[]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-20T08:49:17.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there Finnster,\n\nThis board is mainly focused on Help & Support regarding technical issues with the game, your post would be better suited for the [Gameplay & Strategy Board](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy) or the [General Discussion Board](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion), however i'll answer here to give you an idea as to what occurred.\n\nThe placement seems accurate to me, if you were bronze 3 last season playing your 10 placement matches this season will most likely result in you being matched up against bronze 4-5 players. Your current estimated MMR is 658, that is around bronze 4-5.\n\nThe best thing you can do if you feel you deserve a higher rank is to work your way up.","replies":[{"poster":"Finnster","date":"2016-01-20T09:02:09.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate the reply but what is the purpose of these placement games if you are going to simply be placed back into the rank that you came from? I was so hyped about these placement games because it finally meant that I was able to get away from the lower elo players and be put into a rank that truly matches my skill. I couldn't stand loosing games because of either someone simply throwing the game or everyone just not knowing what to do in each situation. \n\nI thought this season meant a fresh start. A start where I could finally push ranks with people that match the same skill as me and being able to rely on a team to win their lanes. I'm a support main btw, and its very frustrating that I don't have a lot of impact on the other lanes earlier on.\n\nOnce again thanks for the reply it now makes a bit more sense as to why I was placed in this rank but I think a new season should be a new start to elo.\n\n-Finn","replies":[]}]}]}
