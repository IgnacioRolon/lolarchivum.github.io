When is the Crafting system going live? It would be great if we were to have some more information on it. It looks like a great system with a lot of fun. \r\nThanks for your time.\r\n-Finn","replies":[{"poster":"Maldark","date":"2016-01-21T01:22:46.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's only been on the PBE (Beta Environment) for a couple of weeks now, along with the coming 6.2 patch changes. Big systems like this usually take a little longer to work out all the kinks on before release though. So at the very earliest it'll be out when 6.2 goes live in a week or two, but I think it's more likely going to hit with 6.3 after that. \n\nJust an educated guess though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-01-21T01:19:45.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8pQHONSyho here ya go","replies":[]}]}
