That doesn't mean that being an emissary has changed my moral code, that would be rather absurd.\n\nIf you;re implying that I am no longer honest about my personal feelings since becoming an emissary I'm very curious as to why you would think that, because it simply isn't the case. At most I'm more motivated to rein in some of my frustration when interacting with people with the stubbornness of brick walls, and to step out of discussions when I have nothing more positive to add.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-10-24T11:35:43.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"whatever toady","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-10-22T07:46:52.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It worries me you'd assume an answer to a harmless question would be, but you're welcome all the same :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-10-22T08:52:46.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is loosely connected to doom bot 'rewards' but I feel like we should receive more IP overall.
