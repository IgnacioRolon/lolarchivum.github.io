The way the system picks up afk/leavers is that it will allow a 5 minute \"buffer\" where you can \"safely\" afk/leave (this is to allow for certain faults with various systems that might cause a player to load late or get disconnected mid-match), then it will mark the player as AFK. The reports will be ignored if the system doesn't pick up anything substantial.\n\n> i feel when a player afks there should be a vote to lock them from rejoining\n\nDisagree. As I pointed out, the \"buffer\" allows for connection issues that might be out of a players control. To simply have someone \"locked-out\" of a match and potentially banned because they were gone for something they had no control over (which is likely something that has occurred for the first time in that match) is, quite simply, overkill. If it were a situation where a player had been gone for 15+ (perhaps even 10+) minutes, and the system had picked them up as an AFK/leaver in a recent game, then it *might* be a bit more viable (emphasis on \"might\").\n\nPersonally, I can't ever see such a system being used.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-03-25T12:20:48.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main reason it won't be used, is because it actually could increase toxicity.\n\nSay someone is playing poorly on your team, and if they just afk, you guys all get a buff, a lot of players would see that as reason to flame.\n\nSystems like these are always going to be abusable in some situation.","replies":[]}]}]}
