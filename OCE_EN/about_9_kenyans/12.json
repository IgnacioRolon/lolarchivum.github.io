You'll still have all the rune pages you have now, you'll still be able to buy more rune pages, the difference is they'll be editable in champion select (like the current Mastery system). Since the Rune Pages will carry over, with no (planned) changes to their availability, it makes sense that they're not receiving a discount.\n\nYou can find this information in Riot Cactopus' thread on the NA boards about purchasing runes before the pre-season [link: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/RlNQkO39-buying-runes-between-now-and-preseason ].\n\nThat said, it may be worthwhile to wait until the new rune system is in place before spending IP/RP on more rune pages, as you may find you prefer to simply have 2 active pages and just edit them in champion select, rather than having a dozen or so rune pages with various presets. The choice is ultimately yours, however.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-09-02T08:47:59.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In preseason the rune system is being replaced anyway, so I wouldn't worry too much about getting new rune pages since what you have only has to last you till (not even) the end of the year.\n\nMore details here:\nhttp://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/2017/09/riot-pls-leveling-ip-and-rewards/","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RazorScythe188","date":"2017-09-02T07:17:35.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow, thanks! didn't notice that xD","replies":[]}]}
