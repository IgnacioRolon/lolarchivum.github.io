When you get leaverbusted, you can't log in to the client or the boards. I think what's happened to you is you've dodged a few too many queues. When a player dodges too many queues or declines matches too frequently, they are from then on placed into a 'low priority queue', which causes them to wait for a set period of time (5m, 10m, etc. increasing as the player dodges more) before they actually join the matchmaking queue.","replies":[]}]}
