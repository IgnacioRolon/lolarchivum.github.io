Is it possible your client crashed causing the dodge? That would be the most likely scenario for you to have to log back in, and would count as a dodge on your part hence the penalties.","replies":[{"poster":"About 9 Kenyans","date":"2016-10-24T10:45:35.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"after they dodged and it did the que wait thing my thing stopped responding all really fast, so nah my thing didnt crash, was someone else, rip","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-10-24T11:00:44.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then your best  bet is probably to submit a ticket about it. From that, my best guess would be a disconnect (as they don't always immediately close the client, but one would likely kick you out of the lobby) followed by the client getting confused and not knowing what to do. \n\nEither way, your client was disconnected from the lobby by some means or another which marked you as having dodged, and since I don't know enough about it, support is probably your best bet for an answer there. If you have any screenshots to add to the ticket it'd help support out a lot too.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
