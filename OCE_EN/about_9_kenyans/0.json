The recent skins thing is weird, and could be a separate issue, that's something I'd mention to support. \n\nSupport is busy and can take a couple days to respond to tickets (even active ones) when things get heavy there, so again nothign abnormal, just a patience game.\n\nB2 to G5 in one season is suspicious though not impossible. Riot clearly has info that leads them to believe you have been boosted, and that's between you and support.","replies":[{"poster":"About 9 Kenyans","date":"2016-11-25T23:29:05.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but its not b2 to g5, ive been s4/s5 prior, i just decided to use alot more spare time in ranked, and if they refuse to answer me after several days its kinda sus :S","replies":[{"poster":"About 9 Kenyans","date":"2016-11-25T23:33:18.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nevermind they literally just got back to me, and basically said they had no reason for it, just that they are allowed to since I clicked the box with agree to terms, rest in pieces a decent game to a bad company, time to learn dota .-.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-26T06:51:49.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you feel it was that unfair you can post a screenie here and I can look into it a bit deeper for you.
