It also isn't based solely on KDA. Things like ward placements and objective kills/assists will increase your score as well.\n\n> [Itâ€™s based on the champion and role that you just played in a game. So, for example, **we look at Annie mid differently to Annie support**. We take a series of performance metrics and compare how you do to all other players in your region in your champion / position combination. **It is percentile driven - so earning a high score means you performed in the top x% of players on that champ in that position.** The grade itself governs the point gains.](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/features/champion-mastery)\n\nThat is a pretty high score to not get an S grade, but there are cases where you might need higher. I couldn't find the game in your match history, so how about a few things you can look at that might shed some light on things?\n\n**CS** - To get those top percentage scores, you have to be well above average in all aspects of your score, not just KDA. You mentioned you had good CS, but you'd likley need damn excellent CS, especially on a popular champ.\n\n**Ward placement** - We're still unsure if this is a factor, however the support grades tend to indicate that it is, and that it's quite important. Ofc you were likely not in support, but you'd still want to be placing more wards than the average for whatever lane you're in.\n\n**Popular Champions** - Playing a popular champion will give you a much harder time getting that S, as there is a far larger pool of scores which means a much larger pool of excessively high scores. \n\n**Strong Champions** - Playing a less popular champion can also hurt you if they are a champion that people typically do pretty well on as it has the same effect on the scores.\n\n**High Difficulty Champions** - Typically one fo the first two will apply here, but for champions like Azir or Aurelion, even though most scores aren't necessarily great, those few people that main them and consistently do really well are going to be creating those real high scores you have to beat. Their low pick rate means those high scores take up a larger percentage than they would otherwise, and thus make it harder to earn that S grade.\n\nThese are of course all relative to the position you play the champ in as well.\n\nHopefully I didn't get more technical than you wanted.\n\n___\n___\n\nAs for remaking, there are a few restrictions on remaking.\n\n> so I have played a ranked before where the enemy has died first blood then afked, which let them remake\n\nFB before the afk would disqualify them from remaking, however if someone was marked AFK before the remake, it would allow them to. More than likely it was a 4v5 that turned into a 3v5 and that first person got them the remake.\n\n> but i just had a game where to jg went afk before we started, and wasnt allowed to even start a vote for it\n\nHe may not have actually been AFK but just standing in base and moving a little or opening shop. If he wasn't actually AFK, then you wouldn't have been able to remake.\n\n> is it a premium thing or something? i feel it should be open to all players :)\n\nThe ONLY content behind a paywall in LoL is cosmetics (skins, ward skins, icons etc).\n\nIf you wanna read more about how remake works you can find the support article here:\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ","replies":[{"poster":"About 9 Kenyans","date":"2016-10-15T09:32:32.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ah thanks for the reply, the ranking thing sorta makes sense, i know i placed and got a ton of pinks pretty hectic people do better than that on jhin, a tad dissapointed that what you said about the remake doesnt add up tho, rest in piece that ranked game ill never get back ahahah, thanks for the inf o on what you know tho","replies":[]}]}]}
