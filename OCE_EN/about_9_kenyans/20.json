I do see a couple of gold/plat players there. It's because normal MMR and ranked MMR are not the same. Higher ranked players usually have lower normal MMR as they don't play norms as much. \n\nIt looks to me that you're at the right rank, with a 50% win rate over 200+ games. Doing pretty well lately, keep up the good work and continue looking to improve and i'm sure you'll get there eventually :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"About 9 Kenyans","date":"2016-10-20T00:37:59.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LMAO yes most ranked is same tier, a few golds and above, and im joking about the insta ranked thing but its just silly to me that i can verse plats and golds as a b1 XD","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-10-20T00:52:46.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=About 9 Kenyans,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=xyBEHmle,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-10-20T00:37:59.762+0000)\n>\n> LMAO yes most ranked is same tier, a few golds and above, and im joking about the insta ranked thing but its just silly to me that i can verse plats and golds as a b1 XD\n\nNothing silly about vsing higher ranks in normals as it is totally different from ranked....","replies":[{"poster":"About 9 Kenyans","date":"2016-10-20T03:04:21.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so you would find it fun to verse a challenger tier player every game?","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-10-20T03:15:52.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=About 9 Kenyans,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=xyBEHmle,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2016-10-20T03:04:21.175+0000)\n>\n> so you would find it fun to verse a challenger tier player every game?\n\nYes. I have versed challenger players in nirmals and ranked 5's in the past. It is quite fun. Learning by watching.
