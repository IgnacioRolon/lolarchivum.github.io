Seems stupid to limit our high elo player base even more with this rule.. Should bring back the rule of only needing 3 players to be 16 and the other 2 not needing to be. Limiting talent isn&#039;t what OCE needs, we need to show as much talent as we can.","replies":[{"poster":"AnÄ±ma","date":"2017-02-12T01:25:14.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because if you're under 16 you're a minor (I believe) and OCS is the place where contracts and such become a normal thing so it's not a good idea for Riot to lower the restriction or change it. \n\nIdrc honestly but I assume that's what it is.","replies":[]}]}
