It would be an invasion game like the tower defence one. With modified abilities, the shadow isle champions would come across the water on boats and defend themselves against the sea creatures (NAUTILUS or FIZZ or NAMI) that board the boats as they come across. So yes there will be 3 bilge water champs and two water champs on the same team, And then on the other side would be 4 large and powerful shadow isle champs. whilst the boats are landing, the bilge water champions are rushing to create defences, picking up barricades with their summoner spells and launching cannonballs at the enemy. After the boats land, the two sea creatures will climb up the docks and onto land. getting different abilities. If a shadow isles champion dies aboard the boat, they are dead but control the mist until the end of the game, the mist slowly hurts the enemies and has three abilities Q W and E. There are three different parts of the dock that can be captured by the mist, the first to win two of the three of the rounds wins the game. \r\n\r\nI RECKON THIS WOULD BE SO COOL AND AWESOME.","replies":[{"poster":"HaveYouSeenMyCat","date":"2017-05-10T07:13:11.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dude at this point we would welcome any new game mode and map, 5 years of playing the same maps gets boring.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pelican2013","date":"2017-05-10T00:29:20.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about a game mode with {{champion:134}} , 3v3 {{champion:134}} -only on a circle map like crystal scar. There is a cube in the center, when {{champion:134}} uses w on it then the map gets smaller and the map is now centered in the new position of the the cube. If you were on the outside you die, also abilities are changed so that if u hit someone with the cube, then the cube drops little cubes which count towards your ult damage (amount has a base like 2 + 2 for every person hit). People would need to be in the center because the cube is your cool new damage, the map gets smaller and so on. There is a lives system, you get three, if you eliminate all of the other teams lives your team wins. \n\nBut yeah your idea is cool too :P {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
