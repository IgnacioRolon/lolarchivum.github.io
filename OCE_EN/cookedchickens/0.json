(Interacts with terrain)","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys, so if you didn&rsquo;t know, recently Riot have tried to really up their anti with the new champions. They are giving them one defining feature and working their way around that. That is what I have attempted with this champion. Please comment and leave your thoughts.\r\n\r\nPassive- All of Merrill abilities drop shards of rocks that interact with all his abilities. \r\n3/4/5 rocks per ability.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ- Sends out a skill shot strong blasting air in one direction. If this hits a rock it throws the rock in the direction and can hit an enemy to deal extra damage. This can only hit one rock at a time.\r\nCooldown-5/4/3/2.5/2 seconds\r\nDamage- without a rock 50/55/60/65/70+ 20% of AP With a rock 70/80/85/90/100+ 70% of AP.\r\nMana cost- 70/75/80/85/90\r\n\r\nW- Takes any rocks on the ground and creates a wall that can be moved by the Q. If someone is hit by the wall is deals damage.\r\n(size depends upon how many rocks are on the ground)\r\nCooldown-15/14/13/12/11 seconds\r\nDamage- 120/130/150/160/200 + 80% of AP\r\nMana cost- 100 at all ranks\r\n\r\n\r\nE- Merrill picks up the scattered rocks with wind and throws it at a target area. This deals damage within that area and stuns for a short duration. This interacts with the other abilities.\r\nCooldown 13/12/11/10/9\r\nDamage- 80/120/150/180/240+ 70% of AP\r\nMana cost- 80/85/95/100/105\r\n\r\n\r\nR- Erosion- Merrill can target a piece of terrain and erode it until it is destroyed. This process takes 8 seconds but only 5 seconds if in the river.  This wall is replaced after 12 seconds but can be replaced any time time after it has been removed. If someone on the other side of the wall gets hit by the wall collapsing they take massive damage. Enemies cannot see the erosion as it is happening. \r\nCooldown- 12/11/10/9 seconds. (You get this ability at level 1)\r\nDamage- 120/200/300 + 100% of AP\r\nMana cost- 0 at all ranks.\r\nThanks for reading please leave thoughts. :D{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Struggle","date":"2016-11-02T19:22:44.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of his quotes should be \"love me some\"","replies":[{"poster":"CookedChickens","date":"2016-11-03T08:01:41.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Father Time,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=gvAwU5V7,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-11-02T19:22:44.301+0000)\n>\n> One of his quotes should be &quot;love me some&quot;\nxD absolutely YES","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-11-02T10:44:58.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess Yasuo and Taliyah did have a baby after all .","replies":[{"poster":"CookedChickens","date":"2016-11-02T13:41:11.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=gvAwU5V7,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-11-02T10:44:58.817+0000)\n>\n> I guess Yasuo and Taliyah did have a baby after all .\n\nIkr I guess they did.","replies":[]}]}]}
