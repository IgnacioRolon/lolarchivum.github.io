His whole kit revolves around him being this elementalist that control the elements with his runes.\n\nPassive - Runes pouch: Silverian has a rune pouch that has 5 slots inside it, he can earn runes by killing minions and gets random runes from minions. \nCosmic and Cold- water\nMythic and death- fire\nAncient and chaos- earth\nCosmic and mythic- air\nMythic, ancient, death, cold and cosmic- ultimate\nBy earning multiple of these runes you can charge one type of rune to be able to hold at most 20 rune charges.       (Starts with 5 of each rune)\nEach rune is rare uncommon or common:\nMythic- Common\nCosmic- Uncommon\nAncient- Rare\nCold- Uncommon\nChaos- Uncommon\nDeath- Rare\n\nPassive- Water: Whenever Sivlerian steps into the river if low on health he uses one cosmic and one cold rune to slowly recharge his HP. \n1.5/2/3/4/5 + 2% of missing health per second             2 Cosmic and 1 Cold rune\n\nQ- Air: Silverian uses a cosmic and mythic rune and shoots out a blast of air knocking enemies back in a single line.\n15/20/40/100/120 + 60% of AP               6/5/4/4/3 second cooldown           1 Cosmic and 3 Mythic runes\n\nW- Earth: Silverian creates a wall behind an enemy that pulls them toward him.\n50/100/120/200/230 + 60% of AP               12/11/10/9/8 second cooldown              1 Ancient and 2 Chaos\n\nE- Fire: Silverian creates a massive fire ball that he places on the ground like a trap. If an enemy champion steps on it, it will explode, dealing damage to them and enemies around the champion. If not stepped on, after it has charged for 5 seconds Silverian can push the blast it creates in any direction dealing damage to any enemy champions hit.\n100/110/120/150/200 if stepped on, 60/100/140/170/240 damage + 55% of AP                 15/13/12/11/9 second cooldown       4 Mythic and 1 Death rune\n\nR- Ultimate Transedance- (Earns at level one) Silverian lifts off the ground and each all abilities become more powerful in dealing 20/40/60/80) extra true damage and extra effects. Inside this 10 second period none of his abilities use any runes.\nPassive- Doubles all healing affects and spreads it to nearby allies\nQ- Pushes enemies further and in a slight cone\nW- The wall becomes larger pulling more enemies toward him and when finished traps them inside a breakable wall\nE- The fireball becomes much larger and has wider AOE\n80/70/50/40 second cooldown            All runes except Chaos\n\nSo there it is, please leave feedback and anything you wish to say will be appreciated, THANKS{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-01T06:23:12.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I appreciate the rune mechanics, but it seems like a pretty clustered one, especially when the champ has to literally buy their own spells constantly on top of their items. We could use some streamlining and making it into like say Viktor or Rengar's 1 specialised item or something like that for instance. I mean there doesn't seem to have meaningful interactions between the champion and their runes anyway since the latter seems to be for all intends and purposes, just alternative resources in place of traditional ones like mana, but now instead it's **_money_** (which is kinda awkward for an elementalist if you think about it). Which in this case we could make it for example, that different actions could earn them different amount of the rune charges, which different spells use different amounts of it as their resource.\n\nOr, if you have to keep the idea of using different runes, then you might want to give them interactions with the elementalist's spells than just having them function as resource tokens assigned to a specific spell. You could say that your character has both standardised runes which would be used as the main resource of the spells, but they could also either earn and utilise extra specialised runes such as your water, air, fire runes etc, that would add additional effects to the spells should they be present. Or something idk, I'm just throwing some ideas out here.\n\n....................\n\nAlso,\n\nR is imo way too OP, as it not only completely negates the champion's own central weakness/pitfall, it also gave themselves too much boost while on too low of a CD. If the said elementalist is almost always transcended, then they are effectively already transcended, and so it wouldn't make sense that there is a serious power disparity between before and after reaching level 6. \n\nShort CD ultimates are usually designed on the basis that it's just something the champion could actually do casually in the lore, but just for gameplay purposes they are assigned a short CD and a \"get-serious\" timer (going from lvl1 to 6). Ultimates like this are usually enhancement or extension of already existing abilities/properties of the champion's QWE (which you got it nailed down), but the increase in the power and effect budget shouldn't be this great as it's just their serious-mode and not a complete overhaul of their existing character.\n\nR needs either increased CD, lower the across-the-board buff, and possibly both to some extent.\n\n....................\n\nThere are other more abstract concerns about this elementalist's overall design, such as how each spells essentially have no synergy factor to work and combo with one another. But I think the rune mechanics and R take priority for now.","replies":[{"poster":"CookedChickens","date":"2017-01-02T07:44:23.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=qbtnAcsG,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-01-01T06:23:12.405+0000)\n>\n> While I appreciate the rune mechanics, but it seems like a pretty clustered one, especially when the champ has to literally buy their own spells constantly on top of their items.
