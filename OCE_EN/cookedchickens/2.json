Does he need a rework?","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys so I was just wondering if I am right here. I see Nocturne played once every 80-100 games and he really doesn&#039;t give much to the team. He was completely left out on the assassin rework and doesn&#039;t do much in general. Maybe its just cause I&#039;m in low elo I don&#039;t know buuuut please gimme some feedback on what you think.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2016-11-27T06:10:20.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Full tank noc, with titanic, people don't understand how OP he is :) i am one of the few people who still plays him","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-11-21T02:38:55.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeh... he's a weird one. I think he is still an \"acceptable champion\" but as you said, it hard to see what he provides that is unique.\n\nI mean, you play him full damage and he can be an assassin. But you can play Vi half tank and do a similar job. Noc Ult certainly has more range than Vi which is nice, but Vi is innately tanky with her passive and new mastery.\n\nReksai too, is just a better version of Nocturne imo.\n\nThere are champions like FIddlesticks, Nocturne, Aatrox, etc that are \"acceptable\" champions but have been out of meta for a rather long time. They will def need a look at.\n\nBut im happy to see that {{champion:19}} is next up on the champion update list.","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-11-27T05:30:44.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aatrox is generally unacceptable.
