She is a very high skill cap champion which I like because she has low damage but with the right Itemisation I think she could be pretty bursty. She is short ranged but not melee. So without further ado...\n\nHealth: 478 + 3.15 per level\n\nZexarth is a high burst ap assassin. She plays much the same as Leblanc but relies heavily on stealth to kill her enemies. She has extreme map control but that can be her downfall.\n\nPassive- (Decay) Every 10 seconds Zexarth is able to select a part of the wall and left click on them to place a spot of corruption and decay, this interacts with her other abilities. While near these patches of terrain she gains percentage health regeneration dependent on CURRENT HEALTH. (+0.2 HP per second for every 5 HP lost)\nDescription- Zexarth can use this tool to zone enemies away from the wall and for junglers to be scared to use their own jungle paths, combined with the ultimate this tool can be very dangerous to squishy's near the wall. After 45 seconds these spots of decay dissapear, effectively making her only able to have 4 of them up at any one time. (Cooldown items do not effect this passive.)\n\nQ- (Stealth in decay)Passive- Zexarth, when close to decay patches, becomes a shimmer that is hard to see but not completely invisible.\nActive- While inside the decay she can activate the ability to teleport behind a non-champion enemy dealing damage. After 2 seconds she teleports back dealing additional damage of the same amount. (20,23,25,27,28+75% of AP) (Cooldown 7,6,5,4,3 seconds)\nDescription- keep in mind when reading the active that she may only jump to non-champion enemies. This ability can give her a chance to try herself out in the jungle. Get the right items and put decay on your jungle camps consistently and she may stand a good chance given the high AP ratios.\n\nW- (Not sure what to name please give ideas) Zexarth charges up a mass of shadow energy that she can spill onto a target enemy champion. While in charging she can not basic attack or use any other activatable spells. (40,43,47,50,54+50%,55%,55%,60%,60%+4 damage per second charged, can charge for 4 seconds and holds the charge for another 2 seconds. Can be charging or holding while ultimate is used.) (Cooldown- 17,16,16,16,16) (Missile 500 units)\nDescription- The reason that this ability has such high damage potential is because it is her primary damage dealer other than her ult. Though it may seem quite overpowered paired with her ult it is supposed to be as it forces the enemy to either see when her ult is up or be zoned away from the parts of the jungle or lane where there is corruption.\n\nE- (Not sure what to name please help) Zexarth fires a projectile that zig-zags widely and does damage to anything it hits. In game it would look like a large number of eights all lined up together. She can recast it to concentrate the projectile which deals more damage but stops after 200 units. If she recasts at the end of the ability the 200 unit range stays the same and the projectile can be used to poke. (Range- 400 units) (40,43,47,50,54+50%,55%,55%,60%,60% then 50,53,57,60,64+50%,55%,55%,60%,65% of AP) And just for some interest- You can bounce this ability of corruption and it increases the range of the projectile by 500 units in range.\nDescription- combined with the w on Zexarth this ability has potential to put an enemy right out of lane. But be careful because tey may catch you on the warm up on w. This e can be used in different situations like laning, poking, farming, assassinating and fighting.\n\nSo here it is, the R...\nR- (Corrupt them) When an enemy champion is near (600 units) to a spot of corruption they are revealed to Zexarth but not her teammates. She is able to teleport to that spot with only a 0.5 second channel and use corruption to shackle them to the ground around them. They are still able to cast non-moving spells and basic attack but they are reduced in damage by 20%. Zexarth becomes a behemoth of what she was and lets the corruption of the isles take over her. For 15 seconds she has increased attack speed and percentage ability power. Her other abilities scaling from AP is increased (by 15%,16%,17%). The shackles deal %Health damage based on the champion's maximum health (3 persecond+3% for every 10 HP). Her Q is then able to be cast on champions.\nDescription- This is what makes the low damage on her Q and W so powerful because all the %scaling is up massively and her Q is able to be cast on champions so that means her powerful burst comes into play and she can deal incredible amounts of damage. This topped off with the upgraded E means not many tanky mages could escape this. I suggest not using the ability on tanks because her escapes are minimal and if she can't get out after her combo and it doesn't kill the target then she is definitely dead unless she has flash. This is what makes her such and assassin and why it makes sense that people will be zoned away from her patches.\n\nLore\nOnce a simple witch from Ionia she now rules The Shadow Isles, or does it rule her?\n\nZexarth was born and raised as a powerful magic user in a powerful government house in Ionia. Her parents then were unhappy when she decided to move to Zaun to try and fix some sort of government into the chaos that it was. Though many of her attempts failed, she did succeed in making a local government system much like having a mayor. The elections were unsuccessful and the better candidates were sadly pushed out of the draw. Through living there for many years she became nearly mad herself. She went to a known powerful potion master for help, Singed. She sought after a potion that would increase her power in the arts of magic. He gave it to her for a price, he must take some credit and a powerful position in the government he knew she has planned. She refused the offer and took the potion by force, using crippling magic to bring him to his knees. This was the first time she had used magic to harm, and she realized, she liked it. She planned to rule Zaun by force, conquering any rivalries in her way with the potion she was to take. However when she took the potion she felt herself being dragged deeper into the evil thing she had created of herself. She fled from Zaun in despair, looking for exile. When she was sailing in the north she found herself cold, in the dark with nowhere to go. Her ship landed on a reef and her whole ship sank. She found herself after, washed up on mysterious shores. She slowly crept into the dark forest before her. She knew of this place by only one name, The Shadow Isles. But where others saw chaos, much like Zaun, she saw potential. After many nights of camping in the cold waiting for the things lurking in the dark to eat her, she decided to find high ground. She traveled miles trying to find a place where she could see what she was up against. Instead, she found something else entirely. She found the very corruption that had destroyed the forests in the first place. She found herself smiling unwillingly and linking to the corruption. She felt her whole body contorting into something else. She took control fighting against the many minds that tried to kill her. She consumed the power of the corruption herself. The evil power coursing through her veins. After falling into this pit of pain for days she emerged victorious and more powerful then ever. Though she still fights off the corruption she now controls herself and rules over the simple minded shadow Isles. The outside world is now more afraid then ever of The Shadow Isles. And she wants to keep it that way.","replies":[{"poster":"Freddymc","date":"2016-10-09T21:16:37.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok first of all, an \"empress of the shadow isles\" does not really fit thematically with the shadow isles backstory and current state. The shadow isles is simply a place of pure chaos and undeath, a place that no-one could really have any control over. The only person that holds any kind of authority there is Mordekaiser, and thats because he's actually not an undead being created by the shadow isles, he still has an intact mind and has not been driven crazy by the mist.\n\nPassive:\nSo this passive interacts with her abilities and gives her some good defensive tools that should help with laning. However, you say it could be used to \"zone\" people, which doesn't make sense since the decay doesn't seem to do anything to enemy champions. The health regen and the fact that you have to wait 10 SECONDS for the decay shit to show, forcing an immobile playstyle really doesn't fit a close range ap burst assassin. I would recommend making a new passive and instead putting this decay thing as an ability that you can use to manually create the decay. It would give this champion a higher skill cap and more interesting gameplay\n\nQ:\nFirst of all, you need to fix those base damage numbers. 13 FUCKING DAMAGE AT MAX RANK that is horrible. The stealth thing is a bit weird. So you can kinda see her, but she is still stealthed right? That means that this \"invisibility\" will be completely useless against champs like vel'koz and ziggs since they are 100% skillshots. I guess this is interesting, but situationally powerful. Also, being a short-ranged ap assassin, having a gapcloser that only works on non-champions is ultra useless since it means that outside of a lane it is purely useless, not that it matters because the rest of this champs abilities are ranged anyway, so a gapcloser as stupidly pointless as this one is not even needed. Good luck killing jungle camps with 13 damage. \n\nW:\nYou sure this is even an ap ASSASSIN because this ability is what you'd see on artillery mages or just standard burst mages. Otherwise, i feel as though something more could be done with this ability.\n\nE: Again, why even have a gapcloser when your two main damage abilities are ranged. The idea of a swirly projectile like that does bring up some interesting possibilities though.\n\nThis champion is not even an assassin since it's two main damage abilities are ranged, and the passive restricts any kind of consistent roaming. Also, there is nothing here that yells \"high skill cap\". two skillshots, a point and click dash and a defensively orientated passive means that this champion would hardly be a difficult champ to play at all.\n\nYou have a lot of work to do.","replies":[{"poster":"CookedChickens","date":"2016-10-10T02:14:31.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback. A lot oof your comments will makemore sense when the ultimate comes out as it is a more assassiny type ability that reacts with her other abilities to make her an assassin that is also good at poke. The numbers I guess are low so I will change that but the Q is only designed for farming.  But thanks for the feedback{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]}]}
