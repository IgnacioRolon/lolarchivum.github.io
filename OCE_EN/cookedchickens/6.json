Taiyo and Tsuki","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Name- Tsuki and  Taiyo.\nThe sun and the moon.\nVisuals- Eastern Dragons,one that has a golden frill and shorter body and one that has a crown of moonlight with a slightly elongated body.\n\nDeath- If one dies the other will die aswell. This means you must consistently be protecting them both.\n\nPassive-  Tsuki does not steal XP from other players so can roam and heal for allies in different lanes. If one of the gods takes damage the other one takes 5% of the damage and they have shared mana.\n\nQ- Gives you control of Tsuki so your basic attacks and movement is his. When the ability is triggered Tsuki heals the closest ally for a portion of their maximum health (3% 4% 5% 6% 7%+ 50% of AP). Cooldown- 0.5 seconds but can only heal on every 5th spell cast. Mana-20 at all levels.\n\nW- Gives you control of Taiyo so your basic attacks and movement is his. When the ability is triggered deals damage to closest enemy dependant on their current health.(3% 4% 5% 6% 7% +30% of AD). Cooldown- 0.5 seconds but can only deal damage on every 3rd spell cast. Mana- 20 at all levels.\n\nE- If controlling Tsuki: Tsuki places a healing pad which lasts for 5 seconds. If an ally steps on it they are healed for the duration. It is a small heal and is based on AP so if you are going ad it does not effect to much.(10, 20, 30, 40, 45+ 20% of AP) Per second.\nIf controlling Taiyo: Taiyo places a death pad which he lays on the ground in a target area. If an enemy steps on it or is on it to start with and it deals(10, 20, 30, 40, 45+ 20% of AD) Per second. mana- 60, 70, 80, 90, 100. Cooldown- 10,9,8,7 and 6 seconds.\n\nR- Tsuki and  Taiyo combine into one god, giving health, attack damage and ability power to all nearby allied champions and self. Q and W are the same but with out the controlling parts. Lasts for 20 seconds. E becomes a root that captures an enemy for (0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 seconds) Based on levels. E is an aoe effect but only captures champs in the middle of the area and others are slowed for 20% decaying over 2 seconds. mana-100, 110, 120. Cooldown- 10 seconds after the 20 seconds is up. He becomes a larger dragon and has a dark orange colour.\n\nGameplay- Tsuki Is perfect to put in other lanes while Taiyo farms. Taiyo can deal  damage to the enemy in bot lane while Tsuki goes off to another lane and heals the mid or top laner. This can be extremely useful especially if versing some one with great burst dmg or poke. eg nidalee, leblanc etc Tsuki and  Taiyo are great for flanks how ever Tsuki only has 40% of the Maximum AD of Taiyo so you must be careful who you choose to flank with or they could be caught out and die easily. A kogmaw type build would suit Tsuki and  Taiyo with a few tweeks. I like the idea and might be a little OP however extremely hard to play. Tsuki and  Taiyo  are mana thirsty so adding a tear in the build would help. I think it would add a lot to competitive play and make for many good moments. In team fights R is perfect to combine the two so one does not get forgotten. It is also on a short cooldown so one does not get lost in repetitive team fights. Adding a protective item into the build would work well for example a banshees to stop poke from hitting one while you are controlling the other.\nRecommended ADC build:\nGuinsoos Rage blade- Gives attack speed aswell as both AD and AP so that Tsuki has better healing.\nMuramana- Good attack damage increase and mana increase.\nBerserkers Greeves- Alacricity for extra speed.\nBanshees veil- Protection while the other is in battle and unseen threats are coming your way.\nBlood Thirster- Gives life steal so that they don't die to easily in team fights.\nTrinity Force- The on hit effect will go nicely with q and w aswell as the built in tankyness and speed.\nRecommended Tank/Top build:\nSpirit visage- increases self healing and gives HP and MR.\nYoumuus- Gives him speed and an engage that he i lacking.\nDead Mans Plate- gives armour and Hp aswell as speed.\nFrozen Heart- great armour gives better dueling potential and mana.\nZZrot portal- Lane pushing armour and HP.\nGuardian angel- Great armour and MR and passive helps with anyone bursting.(Note; when one has used guardian angel it goes on cooldown for both of them, this goes for activatable items and all other items with a passive such as this one eg Deadmans, Steracks and randuins.)\n \n\nLore- The sun and the moon are the constant circles in life. The ying and the yang, the good and the bad etc. However, when they cross in something called an eclipse the sun and the moon become one. Thousands of years ago in Runeterra the Moon crossed infront of the sun creating a gateway for the gods to tresspass into the mortal realm. They came down into the mortal realm as imortals and the earth shook in disagreement. The beings of power however loved their new life in Runeterra and wanted to stay. They took on the names Tsuki and Taiyo. They each had a child which they blessed in their light. Tsuki's was Diana and Taiyo's was Leona. The two waged war on each other. Tsuki's lust for power left him in confusion on which to choose, his brother or his Daughter in light. Torn he struck them both down with a huge beam of moon light casting shadows upon the Earth. For a whole year they were at war with one another, the sun versing the moon. Taiyo wanted peace but tsuki needed power.\n\nYears later when the whole Earth had been effected, the sun scorched deserts of Shurima and the dark moonlit aura of the shadow isles, the two found a common enemy. Aurelion Sol creator of the stars them selves. Wanting to be the only dragons in existense they took him to battle that shook the Earth for years. \nount Targon saw this battle as a sign of war and tried to destroy the sun and the moon themselves. But the petty mortal weapons of Runeterra were no match for this sort of godly power. To defeat this great foe the old brothers new they had to combine into one. After many years of no practice in the arts of the eclipse they worked constantly for days trying to perfect this all the while being enemies. Soon they became the ultimate ecplise. They went out of hiding and faced the older dragon  of creation in a fierce battle. Soon the Taiyo struck him down with one mighty blow of the tail and they once again became one. They crushed Aurelion Sol with a great crunch of their jaws. \n\nThey had mercy on Aurelion Sol's life on one condition. That the Tagonians would see him as a warrior and not a god, and they would only worship the gods of the sun and the moon.\n\nHope you like the general idea.

If you allow one to be ap and one to ad, the other will perform poorly and as such is wasteful of the benefit of having two champs in one.  How does R work, what if you have one champ on one side of the map when you need to transform, where does the god form up how do you dictate the location ect. I like the idea but needs some tweaking forsure. I would also stick to one button toggling the champs I.E Q and it would just have a dark blue glow  ( such as the glow with a passive that can be toggled on and off like cho'gath) when Tayio and a bright yellow glow when toggled to Tsuki, which frees up W and E for spells that would have *When controlling Tayio this move does X and when controlling Tsuki this move does X* so that would be the same for W and E which again would be of a bigger benefit. I love the idea of light being the healer and moon being the damage dealer, and was thinking more so a world of warcraft reference. You could have something similar to a priests healing well placed in one spot that players in a vicinity could gain benefits from for a certain amount of time or till its total healing is used up. You could then elaborate into something like a moon beam for the damage dealer that had an overtime damage effect ect. Just my 2 cents :)","replies":[{"poster":"CookedChickens","date":"2016-04-29T07:24:46.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for feed back I'm gonna post again with some tweaks, I am changing the q to the toggle ad the w to a whole new ability some ideas would be great THANKS.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"starbreeze","date":"2016-04-16T09:48:59.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the sun and moon concept sounds a lot like diana and leona but thats really well thought out :)","replies":[{"poster":"CookedChickens","date":"2016-04-16T13:51:13.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback but I kinda based it around that whole concept of diana and leona worship these gods unknowingly.","replies":[]}]}]}
