Champion Concept please leave a comment...","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vexapol is a mid laner who excels in the art of true damage. She can twist the wind to her will yet is different to Yasuo and Janna. She uses the wind like her blade and destroys champions and structures alike.\r\n\r\nPassive (Will of the Wind)- Vex can basic attack allied champions to give them extra movement speed. The basic attacks bounce to enemies dealing half the damage that a normal basic attack would do.\r\n\r\nQ (Cutting strike)- Vex deals damage in a semicircle pointing away from her. This deals damage if below 50% health but if the are over 50% health then she does true damage based on AP. If this ability hits an ally then they have 10/11/12/13/14% increased movement speed for 7.5/8/8.5/9/9.5 seconds. If it hits an enemy they are sped up by 5% at all ranks.\r\n105/110/130/145/150 Damage/True damage + 60/65/70/75/80%, (12,11,10,9,8 second cooldown). Missile Range: Up to 500 units and lowest is 200 units.\r\n\r\nW (Will of the breeze)- Vex blesses someone with a minor movement speed buff which gives them 5/10/15/17/19% increased movement speed for 10 seconds. While this buff is active the owner can deal damage to create a shield. The more damage they deal the more the shield contains. After the shield expires it explodes and deals damage around them based on how much health the shield contained. This can be placed on herself.\r\n16/18/20/22/24% of damage dealt is put into the shield maxing at 30% of maximum health. 0.2/0.3/0.4/0.5/0.6 Damage done per 1 health in the shield. (12/11/10/9/8 second cooldown)\r\n\r\nE (Eye of the wind)- Vex places an orb of wind that lasts 2 minutes on the ground. This orb has a vision of 600 units around itself. If an enemy steps on this orb they take damage and enemies within an area of 300 units also have half the damage taken. An ally can also stand on this and gain a movement speed buff for 5 seconds.\r\n20/30/40/50/60 damage + 60% Ap at all ranks. If allies step on it they gain 13,14,15,16,17% movement speed. (40 second cooldown that can stack up to 2 stacks)\r\n\r\nR (Instil destruction)- Vex summons a massive amount of wind that she throws at an enemy champion or structure. The amount of damage dealt is dependent on how much movement speed he has placed onto enemies or allies. If she topples a structure or champion then they explode and give movement speed to all allies within a 1000 unit radius.\r\n650/675/700 true damage +65% AP + 3% damage per 1 movement speed. (170/165/160 second cooldown)","replies":[]}
