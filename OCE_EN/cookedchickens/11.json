These skins include dragon trainer on dragon side. the game is a 3v5 but the dragons have extra powers and higher dmg.\r\n\r\n\r\nDragon: Defend your nests, if they all die dragon slayers win.\r\n\r\nDragon Slayers: Destroy the dragon nests, if you can not kill them in time, the mother dragon will rise and destroy their base with fire. If they have not destroyed all the nests in 20 minutes the dragons win.\r\n\r\nSo the game would be played on a dragon themed summoners rift, where the turrets would be dragons on the dragon side and the slayers would have normal turrets. \r\n\r\nThe dragon nests are the 3 inhibitors\r\n\r\nThe dragon slayers turrets would be invincible but the dragons turrets would be very vulnerable\r\n\r\nDragon powers are replaced by summoner spells and there are three of them of which you can choose 2\r\n\r\nFire Breath: Breath fire out into a cone dealing massive damage and being able to control the direction with your cursor. like a Miss fortune ultimate that you can control\r\n\r\nDragons wrath: after 2 seconds of channeling, blow all enemies away from you in all directions, dealing damage and stunning them for a brief delay.\r\n\r\nQueen&#039;s gift: after 3 seconds of channeling, teleport 5000 units anywhere around a turret.\r\n\r\nSo I think this would be sick, please share your thoughts, have a great day.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-03-10T12:46:13.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's good but Riot probably wouldn't let everyone play with free skins for a game unless someone paid them a hefty sum of RP","replies":[{"poster":"CookedChickens","date":"2017-03-10T12:55:10.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fitzky,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=fA1RUJGb,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-03-10T12:46:13.846+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s good but Riot probably wouldn&#x27;t let everyone play with free skins for a game unless someone paid them a hefty sum of RP\n\nlol too true","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-03-10T23:05:08.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So essentially Queens gift is just a buffed as teleport.","replies":[{"poster":"CookedChickens","date":"2017-03-11T01:00:05.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=fA1RUJGb,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-03-10T23:05:08.135+0000)\n>\n> So essentially Queens gift is just a buffed as teleport.\n\nyep!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
