Control two champs","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Name- Tsuki and  Taiyo.\nThe sun and the moon.\nVisuals- not to sure yet, wanting ideas for small creaturesc type beings. One of light one of Darkness.\n\nDeath- If one dies the other will die aswell. This means you must consistently be protecting them both.\n\nPassive-  Tsuki does not steal XP from other players so can roam and heal for allies in different lanes. If one of the gods takes damage the other one takes 5% of the damage and they have shared mana.\n\nQ- Gives you control of Tsuki so your basic attacks and movement is his. When the ability is triggered Tsuki heals the closest ally for a portion of their maximum health (3% 4% 5% 6% 7%+ 50% of AP). Cooldown- 0.5 seconds but can only heal on every 5th spell cast. Mana-20 at all levels.\n\nW- Gives you control of Taiyo so your basic attacks and movement is his. When the ability is triggered deals damage to closest enemy dependant on their current health.(3% 4% 5% 6% 7% +30% of AD). Cooldown- 0.5 seconds but can only deal damage on every 3rd spell cast. Mana- 20 at all levels.\n\nE- If controlling Tsuki: Tsuki places a healing pad which lasts for 5 seconds. If an ally steps on it they are healed for the duration. It is a small heal and is based on AP so if you are going ad it does not effect to much.(10, 20, 30, 40, 45+ 20% of AP) Per second.\nIf controlling Taiyo: Taiyo places a death pad which he lays on the ground in a target area. If an enemy steps on it or is on it to start with and it deals(10, 20, 30, 40, 45+ 20% of AD) Per second. mana- 60, 70, 80, 90, 100. Cooldown- 10,9,8,7 and 6 seconds.\n\nR- Tsuki and  Taiyo combine into one god, giving health, attack damage and ability power to all nearby allied champions and self. Q and W are the same but with out the controlling parts. Lasts for 20 seconds. E becomes a root that captures an enemy for (0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 seconds) Based on levels. E is an aoe effect but only captures champs in the middle of the area and others are slowed for 20% decaying over 2 seconds. mana-100, 110, 120. Cooldown- 10 seconds after the 20 seconds is up.\n\nGameplay- Tsuki Is perfect to put in other lanes while Taiyo farms. Taiyo can deal  damage to the enemy in bot lane while Tsuki goes off to another lane and heals the mid or top laner. This can be extremely useful especially if versing some one with great burst dmg or poke. eg nidalee, leblanc etc Tsuki and  Taiyo are great for flanks how ever Tsuki only has 40% of the Maximum AD of Taiyo so you must be careful who you choose to flank with or they could be caught out and die easily. A kogmaw type build would suit Tsuki and  Taiyo with a few tweeks. I like the idea and might be a little OP however extremely hard to play. Tsuki and  Taiyo  are mana thirsty so adding a tear in the build would help. I think it would add a lot to competitive play and make for many good moments. In team fights R is perfect to combine the two so one does not get forgotten. It is also on a short cooldown so one does not get lost in repetitive team fights.\n\nLore- The sun and the moon are the constant circles in life. The ying and the yang, the good and the bad etc. However, when they cross in something called an eclipse the sun and the moon become one. Thousands of years ago in Runeterra the Moon crossed infront of the sun creating a gateway for the gods to tresspass into the mortal realm. They came down into the mortal realm as imortals and the earth shook in disagreement. The beings of power however loved their new life style an dwanted to stay. They took on the names Tsuki and Taiyo. The mortal beings have for ever worshipped them and they have blessed some with their own powers. Diana and Leona worshipped them and soon Tsuki and Taiyo became drawn apart by the prospect of power. The earth had seen its first imbalance of the spirits. The two gods soon learnt that power was a misguidance and they must trust one another to truly create peace. But as they did so their blessed children became angry at them and started to fight in order to seek power. Now the gods main role is to establish peace between the two sisters... however hard it may be.\nHope you like the general idea.

I didn't see that in there. I think for balancing so you're not farming etc/losing out when dead that might be a thing to throw in there.","replies":[{"poster":"CookedChickens","date":"2016-04-16T05:40:21.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THANK YOU been waiting for hours for feed back and i will certainly put that in there i have been thinking about that i didn't put it in cause i wasn't sure. But probably they will have that if one dies the other one dies aswell.","replies":[]}]}]}
