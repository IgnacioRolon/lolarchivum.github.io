I think my ideas really suit him more than his kit now and really review on his personality and scary nature.\n\nSo please read, enjoy and I hope you like it.\n\n\n\nPassive- Every time Yorick kills a minion he summons its soul to attack other enemy minions. These souls can not hit enemy champions or towers. The souls last for 5 seconds at all levels. These souls are untargetable.\n10, 12, 14 damage +8% of AP\nlevel 1, 8, 16.\n\n\nQ- Yorick selects an enemy minion (no neutral monsters) for death. If he but only he kills this minion it becomes his slave that follows him around and attacks anything he targets with q. If this minion kills another minion it also becomes Yorick's slave. \nYorick can have (5,6,7,8,9) minions at a time.\nMana- 50 mana upon cast. If another minion dies from this minion then this costs another 50 mana. If Yorick is oom then he can no longer create any minions.\nThese minions last forever until an enemy minion or champion kills it. They also have the same amount of HP as when the minion first spawned.\n\n\nW- Yorick selects an enemy champion and causes it to have a plague. Any minions or souls (including passive) yorick has created instantly are drawn to this target. The target also suffers a loss of movement speed. Last 3 seconds.\n(40%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65% for 3 seconds.)\n\n\nE- Yorick consumes all the souls or minions he has created and gets a buff based on the amount he consumed.\n\n1- Yorick gains 5% movement speed for 5 seconds.\n2- Yorick gains 5% extra AP for 10 seconds\n3- Yoricks attacks slow its targets for 10% of there movement speed  for 15 seconds.\n4-  Yorick shoots one of the souls back out by pressing E again and it goes in a skill shot towards the cursor. (60,70,80,90,100 + 15 of AP).\n5 or more- Yorick becomes extremely powerful and his next basic attack deals 60% extra dmg.\n\n\nR- Yorick empowers all his minions and souls and increases their attack rate and attack damage aswell as movement speed by (40%, 50%, 60%, 100%). Yorick gains this ability at level one. All minions also become invulnerable. Lasts (4, 5,6, 10 seconds.)\n\n\n\nHEY GUYS. So those are my thoughts, I think that its cool that his whole kit works around how many minions and souls he has and it creates a lot of serious tactics of when to team fight, when to take objectives and so on. It creates lots of out play potential for the enemy team as he becomes useless if they destroy his minions prior to the team fight. He has an extremely good laning phase and can push the enemy out the lane really easily yet has quite a weak mid game where you can get back on him and push him down before his late game spike. In his late game spike the last point in his ultimate really increases his potential damage. My idea of the champion is that you max his q in order to have as many minions as possible \n\n\nWANTING FEEDBACK :D thanks guys enjoy.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Chico666","date":"2016-05-28T04:00:42.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting but i doubt rito would let it fly as they are crashing down on moves having to be skill shots now, Skill shots skill shots skill shots is their new motto imo :) nice ideas tho i think it would really bring {{champion:83}}  back into the game :)","replies":[{"poster":"CookedChickens","date":"2016-05-28T10:53:54.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty bro D: its sad but true.","replies":[{"poster":"Chico666","date":"2016-11-08T02:04:58.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They pretty much used a the things u said here to rework yorik haha :) The Q anyways :P Nice work","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-05-29T01:20:18.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"They also have the same amount of HP as when yorick or his minion killed it.\"\n\nso its always 0 hp... that sounds great","replies":[{"poster":"CookedChickens","date":"2016-05-30T08:57:33.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"-.-\nThank you for picking up on that.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-05-30T09:27:20.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> They also have the same amount of HP as when the minion first spawned.\n\n... \n\n>These units gain health points equal to 250/300/350/400/450 (+0.1 ap)\n\nflat hp with scale would be better... supers would be little broke if you ask me otherwise","replies":[{"poster":"CookedChickens","date":"2016-06-02T11:09:36.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks but I plan that you are not able to be able to q a super :P thanks","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
