We've done some digging and it does seem like there is some abnormal packet loss happening for players on TrustPower.\n\nOne thing you might be able to do is submit a trace route to TrustPower to help them figure out where things might be failing.\n\n[instructions on how to perform a trace route](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200169336-How-do-I-run-a-traceroute-)  \n** Replace \"yourdomain.com\" with this IP address: 103.240.227.5 **\n\nSend a copy of the trace route to TrustPower, and explain you are experiencing packet loss issues to the League of Legends Oceanic Game Servers.  You can point them to this thread too if necessary.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"TimeShift","date":"2017-09-21T05:07:25.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did what yous recommended above with the trace route, talked to trust power and looks like they have sorted it.\nCheers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bazzah","date":"2017-09-22T04:06:16.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"G'Day guys. \n\nI'm not from NZ but from Aus.
