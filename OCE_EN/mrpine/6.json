They are super frustrating to play against, but more often than not wont win the game. They are very team dependant, so you should only pick Rengar if your team already has all the other bases covered (AP mage, Tank, Bruiser, etc etc. if your team already has a Zed mid and a Camille top, then Rengar probably isn't your best pick.)\n\nIn any case, as Rengar in that situation, you should still be killing people, but you have to make sure its the right people, your main priority should be to catch out key players on the enemy team. If you can take out the ADC or APC before a fight begins, then your team is more likely to win the fight and then get some uncontested objectives or push afterwards. \n\nBut don't spend time walking round looking for people to catch out, split push lanes, and when you see an opportunity, go for it, don't go looking for it.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-01-09T00:42:17.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, when i have those games where i get ahead, or where im duo bot lane with a mate, my strats wouldnt work at all with assasins, for example with anivia or viktor my two mid laners, i can casually push with side wards, and if they come close, its usually 3 people, or i can zone away or double kills depending on who they send, worse case, adc gets caught up a little in farm and levels. If im botlane with my mate, we usually just push the lane a while and when they come for us, we always have the side ward up due to only having one side bush, at this  point with with a heavy cc champ bieng ahead, having a single ally to help push to get that little extra dps you need can make or break the game, if this advice seems to be a little bit more relatable to you be all means use this, but ELAM's advice is more professional and written better, but in my opinion i dont see that kinda thing happening in my games XD strange","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrPine","date":"2017-01-07T00:24:41.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmm yeah that is true iv realised especially since i play him top a lot i tend to focus more on my lane opponent then the carries, ugh guess just have to keep practicing. thanks for the tips !","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-01-07T00:54:42.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Greetings MrPine,\n\nTo be productive in those kind of situations the first thing to do is to assess what kind of champion Rengar is and what his kit is. In this case you are fed, as an assassin and you get leaps from being in bushes.\n\nWith this in mind in my opinion what you can do is control certain parts of the jungle and use that as a rotational advantage for your team. For example if your team wants to get dragon, before it's time for it to spawn try to get control of their side of the jungle and clear out wards in it. This makes the enemy team have to make two choices. Either risk walking into the fog of war and die, or let youe team get the objective for free.\n\n---\n\nThe other thing that you can do is split push. This will pull poeple from the enemy team towards you or give you free pushes for tower. In this case you are fed so they will have to send at least 2 ppl to stop you. When they do tell your team to force what will be a 4v3 and win the fight.\n\n--- \n\nOther than that what you can do is roam around for kills. Getting picks on enemy carries can be hard, yet not impossible. One way to make it easier is to get timers on the enemy red and blue buff. The amount of ADCs or mid lanes that will get greedy for their buffs and go alone is quite funny. This can get you free kills and remove summoners or one of their carries removed completely from the next fight.\n\n---\n\nThe last thing I'd like to note is you can still 5v5 team fight however try to avoid at all costs engaging on their carries. Let your or the enemy team engage the fight and be patient. In the loading screen you need to assess what are the main cooldowns you need to watch for. An example would be Malzahar ult, wait until this is used along with other cooldowns before going in yourself. Try to note in your head a few important cooldowns to look out for before you go in.\n\nThis will make getting kills a lot easier and cleaning up for more kills even easier. This advice can also be applied to other assassins like Akali or Katarina. Side note don't be afraid to use flash to get to their back line If you have to.\n\n---\n\nI hope that this advice helps if there is any other questions I can answer or any other way I can help let me know. Good luck in your games!\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"MrPine","date":"2017-01-07T01:29:28.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the advice, just a few questions, would it be better after level 9 to get red trinket instead of wards? Personally i leave the wards incase i need to quickly jump over a wall via a camp and for vision but i cant really clear with it. Also in regards to split pushing iv tried but ever since they changed rengars kit (i havent played since maybe may 2016) i find it very dangerous to push that far out especially with my ult no longer giving me stealth. Also would dying for a tower (worst case) be worth it if i had a bounty on my head? thanks !","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-01-07T04:49:51.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Greetings again,\n\nPersonally I think that as far as the trinket goes it really can be situational. As you brought up having wards can be useful for going over walls of getting vision on targets. However I think while that can be useful early in the game, I think that having the Oracle Alteration will help you a lot more. Being able to disable wards that you run through if you are going for an invade or as previously discussed trying to control a section of their jungle. You can also use it to \"outline\" invisible or camouflaged targets. This can be really useful if you are trying to assassinate a champion that can go invisible. While you can't attack them directly if they are invisible you can throw an E or Q in their direction to hit them since you will have an idea of where they if you use Oracle Alteration. \n\n---\n\nAs far as the split pushing thing goes I do agree with you that would make it seem like split pushing can be a lot more dangerous on the champion. Previously you had a get out of jail free card being able to ult away if anyone came your way. However it doesn't make split pushing impossible, you just have to be a bit more strategic with how you go about it. \n\nThe first thing that I would recommend before you start split pushing is make sure that you know where all of the team members from the enemy team are on the map. Starting a split push while they are all MIA is where things can be really dangerous. When you are going to start, tell your team to ping if any of them go missing, however make sure you keep an eye on the map yourself just inc ase. After that while you are pushing, you can also take nearby jungle camps as you are pushing up the wave to starve the enemy from even more gold. \n\nWhile you are keeping your eye on the map, try to make a list of who it is that you are afraid of coming after you. If you see that X member or X many members are coming towards you, but you feel like you can still fight them you can stay. However if you are able to see them as they leave into the fog of war, you can still run away or use your ult if you are really over extended to get out like you used to. As the enemy won't know where you are, and won't know where to start looking for you.\n\n---\n\nAs for dying for a tower, I think this comes down to the direct situation. If we are talking a Nexus tower, this have a lot more value and I can see you justifying dying to get one of to two of these quite easily. However there are two main things that you have to keep in mind when you are going to die to get a tower. The first one is how much is your bounty worth, and how long is your respawn timer going to be. If your bounty is worth a lot of money it can be hard justifying dying for one tower unless it is one that your team really needs. Along with this if your death timer is too long and you are a vital part to your team with how fed you are, you dying for one tower may end up making it so that the enemy gets 2-3 or even more towers.\n\nSo depending on the situation, use your own judgement and learn from the outcomes of what choices you make.\n\n---\n\nI hope that this helps and covers the questions that you have asked. Good luck in your games!\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"MrPine","date":"2017-01-07T05:05:54.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lmfao holy reading through i couldnt help but think damn you take everything into concideration, the death timer didnt even cross my mind when i mentioned dying for a tower, guess that just comes with experiance aha. thanks heaps for the advice bud (:","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-01-07T05:10:54.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No Problem mate.\n\nIf you ever have any other questions feel free to let me know.
