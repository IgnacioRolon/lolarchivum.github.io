However good news we added flat ArP to Maw. This means first 3 items can be like Warrior, Hydra, Youmuu's / Maw and have flat penetration. It also means you can get both of them in your build fairly easily, making it great to assassinate squishies.\n\nLW is good if top and jungle have double armour items. Otherwise I'd focus on flat pen and taking out the carries.\n\nHope that kinda answers.\n\nCheers,","replies":[{"poster":"MrPine","date":"2016-01-06T02:53:37.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awh much sucky, Maw is too expensive to rush the thing that made LW so good was it was very cheap aha thanks for the idea tho :P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-01-07T13:36:26.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"at least armour pen marks might be a better choice. 9 marks gives you 11.5 armour pen, which is pretty ok for a flat value","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alex Manisier","date":"2016-01-06T02:31:55.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Filthy Rengar main here.

It is only ever worth it if half the enemy team has 2-3 armor items EACH. Seriously every other armor pen item is better in almost all situations:\n\nEnemies got low-ish bonus armor items like {{item:3157}}  or {{item:3047}} ? \nget {{item:3142}} \n\nEnemies got lots of high base armor like {{champion:44}} , {{champion:54}}  or {{champion:33}} , and/or are stacking armor?\nget {{item:3071}} . You aren't going to burst them if you had {{item:3035}} anyway, why not get Black Cleaver and get 20% CDR, Rage passive and get 30 more AD (15 more than {{item:3033}} and {{item:3036}}).\nThe armor pen numbers are in favor of Black cleaver: up to 30% TOTAL Armor Pen vs. 30%-40% BONUS Armor Pen. Oh and Black Cleavers armor pen? IT SHREDS ARMOR FOR YOUR TEAM HAS WELL. As an AD assassin, you have done something that you thought you would never do, assist your ADC into doing more damage.\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \n\nSeriously though, LW and both upgrades are going to be the seasons past Zeyphyr and Gunisoos of this season, they have no place in at all on any champ.\n\nCombining Youmuuus, Black Cleaver and Armor Pen Marks and Quints seems to work best for all the AD Tear Gods that I play anyway {{champion:110}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:126}} , and I would image it would work well on AD assassins like {{champion:107}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:238}} \n\nThe odd one of the bunch has to be{{item:3156}}. Back in season 5, this was an assassin's defensive item. Now it is just weird, sure most of the stats are nice, but only 10 armor pen? Bump that up to 15 I reckon, make the upgrade from {{item:3134}} worth something.\n\nAnd of cause the removal of armor pen from {{item:1400}} {{item:1408}} {{item:1412}} now makes it the poor man's version of {{item:3142}}, but undoubtedly 10 CDR is more useful than 10 Armor pen for junglers, especially of the manaless variety.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imasukai","date":"2016-01-06T02:15:41.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's because it only ignores bonus armour now.
