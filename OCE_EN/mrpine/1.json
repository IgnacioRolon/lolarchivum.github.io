If you keep winning it should get better, but your LP gains usually slow down a bit after you promote.\n\nAlso you've lost 5 of your last 9. I wouldn't call that a win streak.\n\nI understand you won like 6 in a row before that, but your LP gains are greatly effected by your most recent results","replies":[{"poster":"MrPine","date":"2015-10-04T11:28:27.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I made the post when I played the Irelia match, I lost 1/12 games and my LP gains kept dropping for some reason. Anyway thanks for the info about getting less LP once you promote, that's probably the reason I saw a drop in it. Always good learning new things :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ninjaIRL ","date":"2015-10-04T03:14:36.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe you're closely approaching the rank were you'll be 50/50 win rate.","replies":[]}]}
