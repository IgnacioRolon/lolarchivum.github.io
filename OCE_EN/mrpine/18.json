Assassins work off killing fast with abilities, which is easier to do with armor pen, people like yasuo, he is more of a melee adc than an assassin, so he builds what an adc would. \n\nIf the enemy has 70% armor having 300 ad, a last whisper and critting would do the same amount as an assassin doing 300 damage with 70% armor pen","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-09-15T05:35:53.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3031}} {{item:3046}}\n\nSustained Damage\n\n{{item:3035}} {{item:3134}} \n\nBurst Damage.\n\n{{item:3031}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3035}} \n\nSustained Burst Damage.\n\nPentakills.","replies":[]}]}
