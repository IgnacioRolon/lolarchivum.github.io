Now most of you might be thinking no way he&#039;s already op (dont really see how anymore since hes gotten nerf after nerf) but im not asking to raise his damage. I think to make rengar more viable his emp w should have a base heal (15pct of hp + pct of dmg taken). Giving this to rengar would not push him over the top but would help him sustain in lane / jungle. I mainly play rengar top.\r\n\r\nTHOUGHTS?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-06-15T10:46:53.088+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My opinion is that if a champion needs to have 'nerf after nerf', it's probably because their kit is not exactly healthy, so I don't see how buffing him is going to make him healthier. \n\nBroken Scripts has a point, the 0.1 second one-hits are not easily forgotten, and **NO ONE** wants to return to anything anywhere close to resembling something that even remotely reminds us of that.\n\nI can't speak for most players. but I personally don't see many Rengars atm, but when I do see them, they don't strike me as either too powerful or too weak.\n\nAnd if anything was to be buffed on Rengo I don't think it should be his survivability. The whole point of assassins is that you jump in, take out the target, and then are expendable.\n\nHaving a champ that can jump in, 1-hit someone and then lifesteal/heal/shield their way out, is not a step forward, _(looking at you Trynd/Lee/Yas)_.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-06-15T09:07:29.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think he's fine.
