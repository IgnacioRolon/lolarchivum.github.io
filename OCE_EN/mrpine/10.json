I highly recommend using cc cleaner on a regular basis to keep your HD nice and tidy :) \n\nOtherwise, check what processes are running in the background of your PC (Ctrl+Alt+Delete) and see if you can end ones that are chewing through your memory.\n\nEDIT: Also, forgot the classic - defrag your hard drive, you will be surprised at how great this and cc cleaner improve your PC performance if it's old & messy.
