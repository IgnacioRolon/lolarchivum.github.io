It would make the game a much better experience knowing we can go into a ranked game and play seriously without being faulted for some one who enters the game with the intention of stuffing it up for others. I find when ever I am in promos it gets worse.\r\n\r\nPossible solutions???","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-05-14T09:20:38.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nI understand how frustrating issues such as these can be, however your suggestion of not losing LP due to one unsportsmanlike player on your team wouldn't work.\n\nWhat if a game that was going well starts going south? Does one person just take the fall and start \"trolling\" or being toxic so that the team doesn't lose LP?\n\n>Possible solutions???\n\nContinue to report players who are negative or are intent feeding, etc at the end-game screen. These reports DO make a difference :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"ElysiumManifests","date":"2016-05-14T09:20:00.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Losing games from others negligence sucks but unfortunately you have to live with it. Reporting them is the best thing you can do and playing with friends will reduce the chances of a wild-card griefer. As for not losing LP due to others negligence this would be impossible to implement and would set a bad precedent. Say a 5-man premade is losing the game. Then one of them starts to feed (with permission from the others) so the team as a whole does not lose LP for the loss. In the end the premade get off unscathed and the gaming experience is worse off.","replies":[]}]}
