Turn him into a broken/demonic meteorite and have his ult turn him into a falling star and or just turn him into a commit charging towards the enemy I think would be  a cool skin to have. The graphics would be amazing. You could also turn that into a bundle with the naut space skin and rumble.\r\n\r\nInregards to Jhin, I think a project jhin skin would be cool. And or you could create a line of METRO SKINS, would be a comical type of skin but you could throw a few other champs into with this idea, you could just turn them into a bunch of flashy, well dressed and or hipster like characters. Like you did with the pool party skins.","replies":[{"poster":"bioslug","date":"2016-05-15T09:32:19.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha ya, first time posting.
