The team has a chance to vote a member and or member(s) out of the group who they feel will troll the game. Thus putting every one back in champ select with out losing LP. \r\n\r\nI know this system can be trolled as well but feedback and other ideas like this will help riot find a solution to making ranked games more competitive and further separate the game play from the normal gaming option. \r\n\r\nAny refinements on this idea would be great","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-05-14T03:09:08.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good idea. However if we want the **Riot** team to look at this seriously, we'll have to find solutions to 2 major problems:\n\n1. _How do we stop people from kicking players who have a low rank or aren't on a meta champion? _\n\n2. _How do we stop people from using this as a better alternative to dodging? _\n\n Either, players threatening to feed (but they actually just want a new lobby), or players claiming someone is toxic (but they also just want a new lobby). We wouldn't want it to just become a way to re-queue until you get your main role.\n\nIf anyone has any idea on how to fix those, I'd love to hear it :D \nI've been theory crafting something similar to this myself, but I can't get past these 2 faults.","replies":[{"poster":"bioslug","date":"2016-05-15T09:28:26.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it would have to be a combined effort from a 4 player vote I would imagine.  So lets say 3 people vote yes and 2 no then the game would continue on.\n\nAswell,  maybe just this one system wouldn't work with out another system coming into play. One that actually tracks sportmans like conduct such as honoring players, games dodged, reports made against the player in question (not just limited to those 3) which would give them an over all score so when you enter a game people can see how sportmans like that person is on that account. A person will not troll on an account that they use to play properly.","replies":[]}]}]}
