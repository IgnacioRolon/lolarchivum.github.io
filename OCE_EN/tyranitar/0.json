I&#039;m currently studying at UC in NZ and am looking for a team to join. I described in the title that I want to be a jungler for a team. I can do anything but support, I don&#039;t feel like I can do much if we&#039;re behind as the support. I&#039;ve had no prior team, so I would need to be taught a few things. Invite me to some pubs and see what I&#039;m like anyway. Free all the time, other than my lectures. Really easy to get a long with. Not a dick and hardly rage (probably get annoyed at bugs more than anything)\n\nAnyway, thanks for readying.\n\nIGN : Chick3n chas4h\n\nhttp://www.lolking.net/summoner/oce/392579#","replies":[]}
