The game gives me a disconnect/an abandon for some reason, even though I am still reconnecting after 5 minutes or so of countless attempts to reconnect. I am getting back into the game and playing as normal, but I am still being registered as abandoning. I have forumed my issue and the solution was to reinstall, so I have, and I am continuing to get the same issue. Furthermore, there were youtube videos regarding my issue in terms of removing files etc from the Riot folders. I have also tried these and still, nothing fixes my problem. I have never had this problem before up until a few days ago. And I am now 5 games in LP as the game registers me as abandoning, however I am actually still reconnecting. I am quite livid, I have to say.","replies":[{"poster":"Corpse Frog","date":"2015-08-04T03:09:10.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just had the same problem.
