I believe Italian is available in one of the EU servers so isn&#039;t it just a matter of a patch here and there for people who would like to play in another language to be able to? \r\n\r\nIf it is more complicated than a patch and a download then what might that be? I understand english is a majority language in OCE but then again there are a huge number of speakers of asian languages as well.  \r\n\r\nI can also consider the problems with using in game or client chat services, however my point is to experience the game in another language and learn some new words and such along the way. A solution could just be to keep chats restricted to english characters.\r\n\r\nWould appreciate a response or explanation from Riot. \r\n\r\nThank you very much for taking the time to read this post.","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2017-02-08T10:49:01.718+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the thing with the oce server as opposed to the eu servers is that Oce has a majority language, which is English, whereas EU has many languages, and most people speak one of the majority languages, (Italian, Russian, English, French, German(?)). I'm not exactly sure how many languages there are to choose from, but those would be my best guess. Most people would speak at least one of those languages. The Asian speakers are generally students from other servers, or just from servers like Garena, or the Chinese server when they get banned there, but English is still the most common in Oce. In a team game where communication can be the key between victory and defeat, you all want to be on the same language, or at least have some understanding.","replies":[{"poster":"Avas Thighs","date":"2017-02-08T11:50:29.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do understand communication is key and i did point out a solution to the communication problem as having an english only chat.\n\n I would however, enjoy voiceovers and champion lines in other languages. I still am an english speaker and also feel as though english as the majority language works perfectly on the server. \n\nI believe that the V.O and such files are optional for each language and are seperate on the EU servers. What is so difficult about using those files in game as they have hardly anything to do with communication and teamwork.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kappaeology","date":"2017-02-17T10:30:14.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} we should do it so if someone is flaming at least its in another language","replies":[]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2017-02-08T12:53:18.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can cant you? in the client when you open it","replies":[{"poster":"Avas Thighs","date":"2017-02-08T12:55:57.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't been on League for a bit but im certain that the only language option available is english","replies":[]}]}]}
