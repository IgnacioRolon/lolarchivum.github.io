You should be able to see the articles on the teams, the schedule and everything on there.\n\nWhat is the esports tab that is blank? I'd love to be able to fix this but I can't seem to replicate the problem myself .\n\nThanks for flagging the problem with us mate!","replies":[{"poster":"LishusTas","date":"2019-01-17T08:58:00.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK, so im not set up with an IMgur or similar, as im not super savvy, so icant share teh print screen i just took. but if i go to link you suggested (the site i did infact try to access) i get a predominantly white screen, with a bunch of menu items in \"link text\" squished into the top corenr, a riot, lol and M rated logo, and the Copyright and links to media, terms of use and rules at the bottom. I may be better served if i could email the screen? \n\nIt is the website you suggested, the same one i had bookm arked and used all of split 2 2018. It could be software on my part perhaps? but i dont have the same issue if i try to go to LEC or LCS esports for example\n\nLishus","replies":[{"poster":"belquin","date":"2019-01-18T03:25:53.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's really weird. The LEC and LCS websites are definitely different than ours so could display differently for sure - but the main website should definitely be up and displaying properly. Could you try another browser or hit Ctrl + f5 for a hard refresh on the site?","replies":[{"poster":"LishusTas","date":"2019-01-18T11:10:08.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firefox is normal browser, IE didnt work either, nor refresh on either browser\n\nMinor Update, Firefox in the URL bar thing has \"connection not secure\". I disabled protection and managed to get it to load a background image of kartus and Morgz with an error has occured message. I'm not sure if this gives any insight. Adblocker made no difference to accessibility. \n\nEvery other menu tab at the topside works fine (news/univers/boards etc) except esports.","replies":[{"poster":"belquin","date":"2019-01-21T00:49:33.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll flag this with the guys who look after the website, cause I'm not sure exactly whats going on lol\n\nThanks for sharing this extra info mate!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
