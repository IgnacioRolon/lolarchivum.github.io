I wouldn't describe myself as being easily tilted but these 2 games of ranked got to me. In both of these games I had a khaz'ix jungle, who in both games more than heavily contributed to the loss. I flamed and was toxic towards him and as a result i got banned for 14 days, I understand why i got the ban (transcript below) and I understand that i was highly tilted and as a result became extremely toxic. However, what I don't understand is why a player who shows on more than one occasion to have extremely un sportsmanlike behaviour  gets away with it. Some examples of his behaviour are  intentionally running down mid lane with 6 faerie charms, leaving the game and afk'ing, and repeatedly harassing our team for playing poorly. \nAs I have previously said I understand why I was banned I became extremely tilted with this play for losing us the game, but I don't why the reason for me getting banned is allowed to go to play another game and ruin more and more peoples games.\nI'm not usually the flaming or toxic type but this just gets to me. \n\nGame 1\nIn-Game\nFrozen Nappies: ok\nFrozen Nappies: balls\nFrozen Nappies: cool\nFrozen Nappies: yeah\nFrozen Nappies: can u def\nFrozen Nappies: god mord is just op\nFrozen Nappies: what happened to the camp\nFrozen Nappies: nice\nFrozen Nappies: maybe dont int\nFrozen Nappies: gg\nFrozen Nappies: ff 15\nFrozen Nappies: how is this champ\nFrozen Nappies: so busted\nFrozen Nappies: sick\nFrozen Nappies: report jungle\nFrozen Nappies: afk\nFrozen Nappies: kys khaz\nFrozen Nappies: how are u this bad\nFrozen Nappies: report jungle iron 4\nFrozen Nappies: sad thing is people like him dont get banned\nFrozen Nappies: khazix\nFrozen Nappies: please\nFrozen Nappies: get off ur big brothers pc\nFrozen Nappies: and then go string uself up\nFrozen Nappies: people like khazix are muffins\nFrozen Nappies: theyre short and round and u just want to fuck them in the ass\nFrozen Nappies: u know what im saying?\nFrozen Nappies: can we all get a group kys on khazinx\nFrozen Nappies: 1\nFrozen Nappies: 2\nFrozen Nappies: 3\nFrozen Nappies: KYS KHAZIX\nFrozen Nappies: good work boys","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-07-08T03:18:51.982+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So far as trolls and greifers go, they're not allowed to engage in that behaviour. Riot's policies are pretty clear on that, and it's in the best interest of Riot and the community that action is taken to deal with them. That said, Riot's systems aren't that efficient when it comes to gameplay offences. The automated systems in place often take a while to track down the consistencies in such behaviour, and will tend to fall short on the more nuanced cases, and Riot simply doesn't have enough manpower to have them all dealt with manually (though there is some manual oversight to help keep the system on track). Riot *should* be working on improving their systems, but as it stands anything relating to gameplay offences just tends to take longer and be harder to detect.\n\nIn having said all of that, player reports are *very* important in helping those systems improve, particularly in the nuanced cases. Those report will help provide feedback to the system, giving it more data to work with, and help improve it's efficiency and ability to detect such behaviours. The important thing is to not feel discouraged from reporting. If there's ever a case you think wont be handled effectively by the automated systems, you can feel free to submit a ticket directly to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Report a player for cheating, phishing, or negative behavior\" option) to trigger a manual review (they wont be able to discuss the results, however).\n\nSo far as your behaviour is concerned, it's probably something you'll need to deal with going forward if you want to keep that account. The important thing there is to try and find a way to deal with these situations that doesn't involve acting out in-game. Some simple things that can help you keep from tilting as hard can include taking a break between games, 5-10 minutes to grab a drink, get a snack and cool down can help, also means you're less likely to encounter the same player twice in a row. If you're on a losing streak, take a longer break, 30-60 minutes, or maybe even overnight or something, and you'll be able to come back with a cool head.\n\nFinding an outlet to release frustration can help as well, something that allows you to take that \"energy\" and put it into something where it's not going to affect anyone else. It could be something physical like doing a bit of excessive, or hitting a punching bag a few times, maybe something artistic like drawing or painting, or maybe something intellectual like puzzles, riddles or even chess. You can try a few different things and see what works for you. Ultimately, better to find a way to prevent those kinds of outburst than to do nothing and lose the account because of someone else doing the wrong thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Frozen Nappies","date":"2019-07-08T03:45:58.729+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for you comment I will keep it in mind in progressing with this, at times frustrating game :)","replies":[{"poster":"Bruno4president","date":"2019-07-08T23:58:33.451+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Learning how to develop your emotional intelligence, it's something that will help you throughout your life mate.
