She spent the majority of Ocean Week playing normals with me and a handful of our friends but did not realize that it was a requirement to &#039;enroll&#039; in order to receive the Ocean Week rewards. When we figured this out last night we managed to pull her to 9 points. Sadly we just lost the last 2 aram games before the Twelve O&#039;Clock deadline.\r\n\r\nWould there be any way to give her a final point or to ensure her spot on the public mural?","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2016-01-31T21:01:33.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Send Riot  a support ticket.
