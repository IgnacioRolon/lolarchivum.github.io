Have you ever been disconnected from a game? Unable to join again or were kicked because you disconnected for to long? Well if you have that means you would encure a 1 day ban to bad for you ay. \n\nAnd afk/DC same thing, because if the ban is only for afk (not a great idea if you ask me anyways) people will just unplug the Internet.\n\nHonestly though 1 day ban for afking for 1 game? A little much don't you think?","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-02-25T23:30:09.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The funniest part is how they think someone should get banned because they are being robbed, or their house is on fire, I mean, what a laugh.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-02-25T00:59:54.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They saved someones life.\n\nHad a heart attack. \n\nRescued one of your family members.\n\nTook a bullet for you.\n\nDonating to charity.\n\nGiving all their life saving to you as a random act of kindness.","replies":[{"poster":"Kakoda","date":"2017-02-25T11:04:23.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=VptWEffw,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-02-25T00:59:54.322+0000)\n>\n> They saved someones life.\n> \n> Had a heart attack. \n> \n> Rescued one of your family members.\n> \n> Took a bullet for you.\n> \n> Donating to charity.\n> \n> Giving all their life saving to you as a random act of kindness.\n\nThere baby needed a nappy change.\n\nThere baby was crying.\n\nThere kitchen caught fire.\n\nThey really needed to do number 1.\n\nThey really needed to do number 2.\n\nThey really needed to do number 3?\n\nSomeone come into there house and tried robbing them.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-02-25T11:09:38.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know what, you shouldn't be complaining if you are only a 10 yearold anyway.\n\nSeriously what blasted retard would let their house burn down while inside, just to play a game.

Children should have learn their homophones in grade three or four, which to my knowledge is when they are 8/9.
