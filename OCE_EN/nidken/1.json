Patch 5.22 is really strange because it's put too much power into early game snowballing while also significantly buffing late game champions and items. Problem is currently early game champions are often able to end before even mid game comes around.\n\nThere's also evidence for this in patch notes, it's not just a coincidence. \n\n1. **Nerfing AP items**. There has been a general mass nerf of AP items, meaning these farm mid laners who stall out mid game by pushing are weaker. It's allowing early - mid game AD assassins to gain very significant advantages against them, not to mention AD mids have had their items buffed this patch.\n2. ** Turret resistances nerf**. Turrets now generate resistances from 15 minutes onwards, and inhibitor turrets don't gnerate resistances until 30 minutes. This is actually crazy, because a small misplay from the enemy can lead to 2 or 3 turrets gone early game.\n3. **Turrets give more gold**. If you get a couple of early turrets you can snowball fast.\n4. **Rift Herald**. People have been ignoring this guy like idiots. He's so broken, if you get a small early lead you give this to your top laner, and he can get those turrets in record time.\n5. **AD item buffs**. Hmmm, weaker turrets, more gold, less waveclear, 4 minute mini-baron and AD item buffs?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-11-14T11:00:09.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This may be the case, but comps like protect the Kog'maw can work as long as you can just play the stall game for long enough.\n\nI never said it was easy, but there are simple things you can do to stall it out fairly easy.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-11-14T02:56:46.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Earlier games are way better IMO.
