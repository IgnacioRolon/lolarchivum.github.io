Sure you have a significantly better K/D/A than your team mates but we have no way of knowing how that occurred. For all we know you could have KSed for a significant amount of those kills. For all we know your team mates could have sacrificed themselves for you to escape death. We don't know what mistakes you made in the match, we don't know what amount of team work you displayed, we don't know. Don't think, for one second, that you are better simply because of your K/D/A. Game play is what matters.\n\nPS: I feel you could benefit from this piece of advice: If you smell sh!t where ever you go it's best to check your own shoes first.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-02-04T05:44:52.645+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You got a good score in a game that the rest of your team didn't do so well.\nWhat could you have done better to help them?\nWhat could you have done better to carry harder? \nWho could you have played that would have fitted your team comp better?\n\nI have climbed out of bronze V twice, I am sure you can do it too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Schakle","date":"2015-02-17T01:39:37.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bruh, you were mid.
