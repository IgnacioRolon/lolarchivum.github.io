Look at his stats. Riot PLEASE do something about him. Why are players allowed to throw Ranked games like this? Its caused me a demotion, and I&#039;m struggling to get out of Bronze but its hard enough with AFKS and feeders. This guy is the worst of the worst. Luckilly I saw his stats and asked our JG to camp top lane at the start, without of course pointing out how horrible his games were,  which he did, yet he STILL fed. All lanes were good until he fed the Rumble. This guy then refused to communicate AT ALL in game, and completely ignored teamfights, dragons, etc, and sat in a lane while we were all dead from defending and base was being invaded. Also if you get him, dodge, its seriously worth the penalty and time ban. \r\n\r\nRiot please please don&#039;t say use the report feature in LOL. It appears reporting (im sure others have done it) has not removed this player from league considering the extensive history his account has been active.","replies":[{"poster":"Daejel","date":"2015-03-29T22:08:24.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy shit those stats are impressive however it looks like his builds aren't troll so I'm going to say that he's just really, really bad at all his game. No offence but if you're being matched with him you aren't much better. As Xicious said, you can't ban someone for simply being ba but if I was that bad at this game, I'd probably uninstall.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xicious","date":"2015-03-29T21:47:50.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think he's toxic or worth reporting, I think he's simply a terrible player and you can't get banned for being crap at the game. There is a reason he is Bronze V XD.","replies":[]}]}
