Is there any way you know how to report it to get an employee to see it? (other then the end of game report) I had people on my team trolling (anivia feeding, and placing ICE wall to deliberately trap me so I get killed, etc. It was pretty much a 1v9 my team wanted to throw because they were angry about a prior game I had 2 of them on the enemy side on my team this game, when they lost because I pushed hard. Im Plat V so I carry hard in normal's.. So they were raging and being toxic, and wanted to get back at me by griefing, going afk etc.. I was hoping because there was a lot much worse said besides this screencap.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-10-06T12:21:34.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we get stats on the match?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Samurai Jin","date":"2015-10-06T08:37:49.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you deserved it","replies":[]}]}
