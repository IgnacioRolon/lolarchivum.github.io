Don&#039;t take it the wrong way, as I am generally a nice person in game and in real life, but I really really need to get this out, (without being toxic like most people become when faced with this problem)\r\n\r\nJUST WHY??????? SURRENDER RANKED, WHY FEED, TROLL  etc?  This is what happens when I don&#039;t DUO. AND I AM TRAPPED IN THIS FOREVER IT SEEMS.\r\n\r\n I am creating another acct to reset my elo. No matter what, I lose. RIOT WHY do you put me in BRONZE V when I won all of my provisional Games? I get nothing but trolls and I try to be positive, communicate helpful tips throughout game, help other lanes, etc. So $300 dollars wasted on skins on an account which is basically screwed and stuck at 250 mmr. I end up ahead in my lane, then other lanes are fed, and then I get eaten. therefore my own stats end up looking bad in some games...  I try to assist other lanes, give up my own pick order to help somebody that is last on the list, ping, watch the map for everyone else. Ward.. Call out enemy items of champs. Try to arrange groups for dragon, lone wolf enemy kills, turrets, backdoors when appropriate. I win a few games, then lose a few due to the fact I cannot 2v5 the other team, when 1 is afk, 1 is feeding, and 1 is just NOT playing with the team. OR a combo of those things in another order or quantity.\r\n\r\nI am leveling another account, to get out of bronze forever. Its the ONLY way to escape. and Ill have to rebuy my skins too. I know several friends who rerolled fresh accounts who were stuck in bronze (because they were new last season)  only to land in Gold after provisionals, and shoot up this season, because they too were STUCK in bronze regardless of their game-play. Apparently a new season doesn&#039;t really RESET your MMR to take in account if a player has improved. The system is so broken. If you drop into bronze, you can NEVER EVER GET OUT PERIOD, unless you magically win 300+ games in a ROW because you lose 3 times as much LP on a loss as you do on a WIN because of this MMR. \r\n\r\nOMG I was a noob last season when I was new at League... still being punished for it this season. My fresh season 5 provisionals performance  didn&#039;t mean anything!!!  I am so angry with riot mainly because of the money I spent on skins, that I am going to have to throw just to get away from the PIT of BRONZE. I am so angry that such a great game is so completely unfair.  \r\n\r\nIf there is any solutions Riot has to reset my MMR so I don&#039;t have to roll another account I am all ears. I can&#039;t even begin to understand this HIDDEN MMR Riot has and its flawed.  Because I play so much better now then I did. And I have lots of people to attest to that in game. I am often asked WTF i am in bronze when I play games. \r\n\r\nI am so frustrated, as many others are. I wish there was just a way to reset MMR per season. I mean, I am a hardcore league player so I have come a long way, but I am at the point I have no option but to throw this account away to get out of Bronze, and It makes me sad because I have lots of skins you can&#039;t get anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Daejel","date":"2015-03-29T23:04:12.778+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to have this attitude OP, then I realised I was bad at this game.

Yes, I like playing non-standard champs (support Shen and jungle Darius are 2 of my pocket picks). I have a natural aversion to \"playing whatever's OP\" (except Sejuani, she was my main before it was cool) so I'm always looking out for something creative that no-one else does.

The Spellthief's Edge is easily the better choice for Sona because not only does her E makes the speed boost of Talisman of Ascension somewhat redundant, she already self-sustains through W, can harass for gold VERY easily with her Q (if you're not poking with Sona there's absolutely no point even picking her), her CC is generally poor so the Frost Queen's Claim's slow is more valuable on her and she needs the extra mana regen of the Frostfang in the mid-game (Talisman has more MP5 than Claim, but Sona should have another mana item by then- although this is largely due to Riot messig up her balance so appallingly). You're probably right about Nami, though,  tend to miss her bubble a bit too often for the Spellthief to be a safe pick, even if she already sustains better than any other support except Soraka.\n\n> I have noticed that with some champions.\n> You dont seem to have a core build follow up.\n> *The sightstones*\n> You play X-Y-Z champions over and over again, yet seem to do different things on them.\n\nI actually haven't noticed that much myself.

I'm a HEAVY ganker. It's why I main jungle and support in the first place.\n> Only gank a snowballing lane, pref bot. But you should only gank if a lane needs help. Get scuttie every 3-4 camps too.\n>  \n> This is a matter of opinion and I have to disagree here. Popular wisdom (it's how they play him at the pro level) still holds that the Shield is the best item on Thresh as it compensates for his utter lack of lane sustain when trading and gives him the extra survivability he needs when he goes in off a Q hook. The Spellthief's Edge is easily the better choice for Sona because not only does her E makes the speed boost of Talisman of Ascension somewhat redundant, she already self-sustains through W, can harass for gold VERY easily with her Q (if you're not poking with Sona there's absolutely no point even picking her), her CC is generally poor so the Frost Queen's Claim's slow is more valuable on her and she needs the extra mana regen of the Frostfang in the mid-game (Talisman has more MP5 than Claim, but Sona should have another mana item by then- although this is largely due to Riot messig up her balance so appallingly). You're probably right about Nami, though,  tend to miss her bubble a bit too often for the Spellthief to be a safe pick, even if she already sustains better than any other support except Soraka.\n>  I know its just my opinion, but for me I like the move spd on thresh as it helps engages and disengages.\nA thresh should not have to \"\"Sustain\" if he learn to dodge skill shots and not take poke.\n\nYou may think that Sona's E makes Talis redundant but it doesn't at all.\nAlso every time you go in to press Q to get like 5 gold, you take half you HP as Compensation.\nYou then have to use up 35% of your Mana to press W and heal up back to full HP.\nthis makes it not worth it at all.\nIf you wanted to poke safely or to go ham. Nami's bouncing heal is nice and Leona is scary as fuck.\n\nAnd coin does give mana regen, and as a proper support you should not be spamming the Q button to earn 5 gold.\nYou should be saving it to heal sustain or to help Kite with you ADC.\n\nBut you can do what you want, I just think Frost blade is useless compared to easy gold + Kiting with the coin.\n*You can also miss with frost blade, but you cant miss a AoE move speed to all 5 members of your team*\n\n> I actually haven't noticed that much myself. What are some examples?\nYou swap items sometimes on your junglers and supports.\n> \n> Erm... what...? Where's that?\n> \n> Maybe I had a stray CDR Glyph I forgot to remove from a few seasons back, when the CDR available from masteries added up to something different. I'll have to go over my pages with a fine-toothed comb.\n\n>I usually go through all my runes and masteries every 2 months or so.\nJust so I know what Im doing. You should try this too. \n\n> Actually, I used to start every Shen support game with a potted tutorial for my lane partner on how Support Shen works (sustain off the targets I mark, don't forget I have a Relic Shield, if I E onto the enemy and Ki Strike them, that doesn't mean I'm going all-in etc). I think I stopped this season because I couldn't be bothered any more, what with the general skill of my ADCs being somewhere around Wood V anyway. Quite a few of them seem to have caught on entirely on their own regardless and he works surprisingly often.\n\n> I think shen support is a bit silly right now. Try him in the Top lane or maybe even in the jungle.\nCompared to Leona, Sona, Lulu.\nYou can get Kited and outplayed.\n*Also just because you think your ADC's are Wood V they probably think the same about you*\n\n> Oh don't I know it... One of my biggest failings is repeatedly going in to save teammates who make dumb plays, turning a single death into a double. I keep telling myself that next time I'll just let the idiot die- and then I do it again. Stupidity shared is stupidity doubled...\n\n> At least you are aware of it.\n*I also still have that problem*\n\n\n> I'm well aware of that last point. I know for a FACT my grasp of the game's strategies and bigger picture is WAY above the level I'm stuck at (did you notice that in my Shen jungle game I placed almost as many wards as *the entire enemy team combined?*) but it's largely my mechanics that hold me back. It's why I gravitate to support and gank-heavy tank junglers rather than carries- they require better knowledge of what to do and are broadly mechanically easier.\n> \n\nJust because you warded more doesn't mean it helped.\nYou having a sightstone as a jungler only helps as much as what your team does it it.\nTry pinking your blue.\n*The brush next to it.*\n\nThis keeps vision of it, and you now have vision of 3 entries/Escapes into your jungle.\nOr you could Pink you red.\nThere are 3 ways with this one, The one Next to it.\nBehind it, or the one across form it near Bot lane.\n\nIf your feeling REALLY gutsy, you could even pink enemy jungle.\nBut that is extremely risky.\n\nMaster the art, of while ganking a lane.\nFarm CS.\n\nIf a lane seems fine, Ignore it.\nGo farm up so you can be a beast faster.\nAll your jungle creeps are gone? Take Crabs or even the enemy junglers camps.\n\nWith the proper vision you can even set up counter ganks as well.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-03-30T22:29:33.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can if you wish.\nGimme 20 mins again to go through and check you out.\n\nAlso, it is nice to see that you play Non meta champs.\nBut you have to do it in the correct way.

I have a natural aversion to \"playing whatever's OP\" (except Sejuani, she was my main before it was cool) so I'm always looking out for something creative that no-one else does.

I don't CS well and I'm not fond of being in a DPS role; I prefer looking at the bigger picture and applying myself tactically, which is why I main jungle and support.\n> \n> Well, have at me, if you like. I'm interested in your feedback.\n\nWell looking at your match history, the main problem I see is problems with your cs.
