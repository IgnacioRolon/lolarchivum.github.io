I find the amount of LP loss a bit big but whatever I guess, there is a reason.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER about 5 minutes ago I played a ranked game, and 3 players where AFK in this game. 1 for all the game, the other started AFKing or completely DCing by the 9 minute mark. by the end of the game we were playing a 2v5. \r\nAt the end of the game, in the post-game screen you could see that 2 of the players in my team had completly DC&#039;d and that the other was simply AFK. \r\n\r\nIn a 2v5 match I lost 24 LP which I am pretty sure most of you also consider unfair.\r\n\r\nWhats my solution? whenever 1 player is shown as DC&#039;d in your team the amount of LP you lose is lower, yet hugher for the DC&#039;d person. by this I mean like a lot lower. like 3-5 LP loss. and 25+ loss for the player that disconnected. this will be more fair for the players that actually felt like staying the whole game in a 4v5, 3v5, or even 2v5. \r\n\r\nI know most of you will think, &quot;oh but what happens if the person had a connection issue?&quot;\r\nwell lets be honest, if your internet speed is bad, by level 30 you should be aware of it, so that is not really an excuse. as for special situations where you have to leave, before going into a game lobby queue, in the screen where you select what kind of game you want ot play It clearly states and I quote.\r\n&quot;work with your allies to siege the enemy base and destroy their nexus, average game length 30 to 45 minutes.&quot; this means you should be sure that you should have at least 45 minutes to play before starting a game. \r\nif you are not sure and want to take the risk, then do so, but be ready to lose a major amount of LP if you DC.","replies":[{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-03-27T02:38:58.839+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there Solquazza,\n\nI've looked over your account and the reason your League Point (LP) gain is lower in comparison to your lose is likely due to your win ratio of 47% with an existing 100 W / 114 L . In addition to that there is the factor of your MMR contributing to your LP gain. According to OPGG, 'your' MMR is around 387 (not exact, as this is a hidden number) but the average MMR of your league is 764. With this your MMR is significantly lower than your League's average. Your LP gain factors your MMR and your League's MMR when doling out points. If a player has significantly higher MMR than the League's average they will receive more. This is usually what is happening when you hear of players skipping divisions. This has the reverse affect on someone with a lower MMR than the League's average. If you wish to fix your LP gain then you will need to put in the hard yard and turn that win ratio around, which essentially is how you are going to bring your MMR up. Which I'm sure you will be able to achieve as long as you keep your mind in it. \n\nNow, addressing the AFK issues. It's unfortunate to say this but due to the inability to micromanage all AFK players since it's incredibly random when a player AFK's for both deliberate and accidental purposes. I also don't think having AFK's is factored into the LP you gain or lose. But with each game you lose the lower MMR will go in comparison to the League's average and therefore whilst it would seem that you are gaining less LP each consecutive game you have an AFK it is in fact due to the fact that your MMR is actually slightly decreasing with each game. \n\nI hope this helps and good luck.\nFog\n{{champion:34}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-27T05:05:53.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"we are gonna lose someone dc to lessen the LP loss\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"LoadingError","date":"2015-03-27T03:01:00.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think AFK should wear 1/2 of your LP lost, e.g.  5 people in the team 1 DC then if the LP lost is 20lp each then all the non afk will only lose 10 lp and the AFK should lose 20 + 10 + 10 +10 +10  =60LP  now what how the AFK rate will improve :D","replies":[]}]}
