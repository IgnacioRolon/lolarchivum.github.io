Let&#039;s take a look back to a few years ago when they &quot;reworked&quot; Mordekaiser (into the same champion except now he basically requires a support to lane), his ult interactions and controlling the dragon pet are STILL BUGGY TO THIS DAY, and NOBODY EVEN PLAYS HIM BOT LANE, in fact he&#039;s barely played at all. You turned Yorrick from a fun sustain laner that was willing to take trades and 1v1s into an actual cannon minion that presses Q on minions and E on champs. Funnily enough, he&#039;s not played much either. Both of these champions are less interactive to play than they were before the reworks, and just as interactive if not less so to play against. Yorrick was nerfed and reworked for the sake of &quot;top lane balance&quot; and Mordekaiser was reworked because you wanted to &quot;revamp&quot; the champion and encourage bruisers bot lane. Both of these attempts failed at accomplishing either, the sustain meta was removed when you nerfed the HP regen of most mellee champs top lane, and everyone tried bruisers bot for literally 1 game, got kited by a decent adc and support then said &quot;ok this is bad, fun, but bad&quot; then dropped it. So no actual goals were accomplished by the changes and what you&#039;re left with is what is essentially worse champions for people to play.\r\n\r\nSo why are you not addressing problems you already acknowledged existed and worked on before, before you decide to change a champion that has been balanced and fun for a tonne of players for the longest time? For the love of Rito, what in the hell are your priorities???? DID YOU WANT TO RELEASE MORE IRELIA SKINS???? I&#039;M CONFUSED","replies":[{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2018-03-20T07:57:40.420+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you complain *now* and not a year ago when the rework was announced?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Michaeltk","date":"2018-03-21T23:09:12.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"irelia felt abit meh, i mean i still enjoyed playing her heaps.. but it's kinda stale y'kno like very stale.. she looks alot more fun now to play and will probably see alot of gametime now, unfortuante for me that is. hardly anyone even picks up irelia, i maybe see her once every 50 games if best.. better chance finder her in arams\n\nedit: oh you're a top laner, i see why you complain now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-03-20T08:48:33.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Umm, {{champion:50}}  is a total replacement champ.\nMay as well made it a new champ, not an update, because all they did was remove a champ to add a new one.\n\nIrelia needs no update, just make a new champ.","replies":[]}]}
