I spent/spend quite a lot of time creating them and keeping them up to date, but when summoner's rift (beta) was released, I had to go through EVERY SINGLE ONE to change it to work for all maps, instead of just Summoner's Rift, since they didn't register on the summoner's rift \"beta\" map. Now, they've all just completely been deleted from my computer. Make Item sets work properly, or remove them from the client. If you want to know how, go and look at DotA. They seem to know how to do EVERYTHING to do with a client in a way that riot doesn't.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-05T23:31:00.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woah, I did not know this. When the new SR came out, my item sets worked perfectly fine.\n\nYou should try backing them up every once in a while; they're locally stored on your computer. The game *is* designed to handle an item set for every champion (around 200 sets I think).","replies":[]}]}
