When i say stomp, it&#039;s either my team doing extremely well (ie 1 or more lanes winning) or extremely bad (1 or more lanes losing). What can you do in these type of one sided games in order to improve your chances of winning?","replies":[{"poster":"vicelore","date":"2015-07-20T05:11:31.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"iv been stuck in B5 recently and cannot get out of the slump, I used to sit around B3 but recently it feels like im playing against faker and voyboy 8 / 10 games.... I feel like I cannot win a game just by holding my own in lane.. There is always one lane feeding like crazy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Myko","date":"2015-07-18T08:43:39.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a game with kat where we were losing (down 1kills to 6) early, but I didnt give up and roamed all the other lanes. Was a very close game, but eventually we aced them and pushed to nexus. In the ones that are one sided to enemy teams,  you have to make a huge effort to make a bigger impact on your teams performance - contribute and roam to make other lanes win.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-07-17T22:38:30.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bow down to your superiors.","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-07-17T17:41:06.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like you said, a lot of games are like this and you wont change the outcome. Focus on winning ALL of the close games, not changing the results of the one sided ones (Even if only 1 in 10 games are close, you can get a 55-60% winrate by tipping the scales in all of these)","replies":[]},{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2015-07-17T14:22:34.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"git gud","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-07-17T16:29:24.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lel rkt fgt","replies":[]}]}]}
