Imo, the easiest champs are ones that don't need great mechanics to play (little or no skill shots), have great escapes, or are still effective when built tanky.\n\nTop - {{champion:120}} Decent sustain and can escape bad situations. Also going tanky is decent so you can survive lane and fights.\nMid - {{champion:103}} Long range spells. Ulti can get you out of bad spots/ganks. But difficult to master because of her skillshots.\nJg - {{champion:5}} Super easy to play. No skill shots. Go tanky and you can survive fights.\nADC - {{champion:236}} Has a dash to escape. Decent range on ulti. His passive makes cs'ing slightly easier.\nSupport - {{champion:25}} Super safe champ.

I myself have thought that im an average player, but i learn very quickly in video games so he wasn't too bad to learn. I play hecarim specifically because team fighting with him is fun. He has the best tactic, charge in, spin blade, lifesteal, charge the survivors. Very fun.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-07-04T08:56:10.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Focus on 1 role.

Thanks, i'm liking hecarim jg atm so im thinking about just going all out and playing him.\n2. I probably need to train myself in last-hitting cs, my worst trait at this game\n3. i'm a crook for this, i do try and calculate my chances of denying them of their recall, giving them a death lol\n4. i'm learning certain builds, for hecarim/talon mainly. Looking at higher ranked players builds for a sort of idea.\n5. Always do, i'm not one to lose my shit, unless im joking with a mate.\n6. IT WORKS WITH HIS W ;)\n\nThanks appreciated man","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-04T19:58:38.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First and foremost.\n\nDon't go into ranked with your builds, learn what actual builds work before you play this game in ranked.\n\nExamples:\nFiddlesticks and WoTA, the item is subpar on him\nAhri with Nashor's and Statikk Shiv\n\nNext learn how to not die, a lot of your games you have more deaths then Kills (KDA over the last 20:  6.9 / 7.8 / 9.2 )\n\nAnd a note, if you do ranked any time soon, you are likely to end up between Bronze 3 and Silver 5, because that's about where your playing normals at.","replies":[{"poster":"Scatman John","date":"2015-07-05T14:18:53.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=60yweIUN,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-07-04T19:58:38.243+0000)\n>\n> First and foremost.\n> \n> Don't go into ranked with your builds, learn what actual builds work before you play this game in ranked.\n> \n> Examples:\n> Fiddlesticks and WoTA, the item is subpar on him\n> Ahri with Nashor's and Statikk Shiv\n> \n> Next learn how to not die, a lot of your games you have more deaths then Kills (KDA over the last 20:  6.9 / 7.8 / 9.2 )\n> \n> And a note, if you do ranked any time soon, you are likely to end up between Bronze 3 and Silver 5, because that's about where your playing normals at.\n\nOkay, well for starters, thanks for looking at my match history. It's probably a joke to experience players.\nThere have been games where i joked and went AD ahri (humorous when with a friend i play) but i do know not too, at least when i try. With fiddlesticks, i am still trying to learn his basics, his build etc. Likewise i have a silver 2 friend who tries to help me with this stuff, try to teach me. \n\nIn my two (now three) games i've played, i do blame my inexperience to ranked competition towards my death count, but then again, i was playing Blitzcrank (shouldnt really be dying lol). I'm really just looking to get into more levels of competition without the gameplay in normal's being far too laid back.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"miliang","date":"2015-07-04T11:11:40.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Feed 2 kills every lane and you can get to bronze 5 easy.\n\nKill opponents twice in every lane and you will win games easily and jump your division.

In low elo's(anything below plat) champion selection has a miniscule influence on the game. You have most likely seen players playjng very non meta champions in weird positions(zac support etc) and still winning games. I remember i only played 2 champions no matter what position i was playing, nidalee and ezreal, and this was back when no one else was playing them, and i would constantly get flamed for picking nidalee mid, and now im diamond, and i still play champions i enjoy(lee sin, wukong, lulu support) over what are considered as the strongest champions(gragas, reksai, janna).

Also don't worry about trying to counterpick or get OP champions, sticking with what your already know will usually be much more effective even in tough matchups. An average champ played at 90% of their potential is better than a strong champ played at 50% of their potential","replies":[]}]}
