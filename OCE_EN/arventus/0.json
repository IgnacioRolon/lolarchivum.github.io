Max W first because its base damage is fairly high and it boosts Leona's base resists making her that much tankier in trades especially in the early levels. Followed by Q and then E.\n\n\nFirst of all **Always use your W when you engage and make sure it explodes on the enemies. **\n1. Walking up to your opponent. This trick is pretty situational but there are times where you're opponent will allow you to simply walk up and Q them. The advantage of this is it saves your gap closer before even initiating. So that if they try to run they will be snared by your E. \n2. When you E, in auto for a second wait for your opponent to take one or two steps back as they predictably will and use your Q to auto reset on them. \n\n3. As of 6.14 Leona has gained incandescence on her ultimate so when you all in at level 6, E in then ult, auto attack, let them take one step, auto attack, Q reset, auto attack. This should maximize Leona's effectiveness in a fight. If you're lucky your E will be off cooldown at the end of your WERQ combo allowing you to snare them again. Level 6 is probably the best time to initiate. \n\n**Builds I typically go for:**\n_>relic shield>sightstone>boots/Targons>FOTM>Aegis shield>Deadman's> boots of mobility>Iron locket of solari>Randuins Omen_\n\nFrozen heart, Eye of of Equinox, Tabi shoes, sunfire cape are also valid choices alongside other boots based on situation as you should keep in mind to optimize your build for the situation. Also take ZZ'rot portal if you think your team is struggling to push lanes. \n\n**\nWhy Deadman's plate?** Well generally this is an all round tank item that increases your movement speed when charges are maxed. Upon the first auto the momentum built up slows the target discharging all charges. This allows Leona to rapidly close in on a target and permit chase easily catching people out. \n**\nWhy Boots of mobility? **Despite losing movement speed during a fight, movement speed during a fight isn't something leona needs when she has a tool to initiate. It's not vital that Leona needs to avoid being kited as opposed to simply being in range to initiate as she locks targets down with ease. When combined with deadman's she goes fassst.\nWhy locket of iron solari? Aegis shield passive and shield active is incredible for helping your team survive fights. Use this against comps with AP in their team. \n\n**Why pick Randuins Omen?** Simply because you'll survive a lot longer and be able to apply the slow once you initiate in an AOE which is really powerful.\n\nHope this helps. \n_**Caution**_\nYou must understand your match ups to player Leona effectively in games even in bad match ups as well as understand your own power spikes. This takes practice because there are many different combinations in the botlane. \nMake sure your adc is willing and ready to engage when you go in.\nDon't pick Leona if your adc is weak early on. \n\n\n{{champion:12}} is a bit of a stalemate because neither can really all in the other without losing their lane granted both sides are competent. \n{{champion:201}} is also really strong because it's easy to lock Leona out and disengage from her comp this I consider him a hard match up but remember all match ups are skill matchups.  This is a lane to play passively unless for some reason braum's wastes his unbreakable wall. \n{{champion:37}} Haven't played against her with the updates but I feel that Leona is definitely strong in this match up simply because she bursts for a long and in level's 1-3 Sona cannot disengage without sustaining heavy damage. When Leona hits level 6 Sona will need to play extremely careful and conserve her ultimate. \n\n\nTL;DR\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-14T11:33:22.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">1.
