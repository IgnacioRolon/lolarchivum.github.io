I bumped into a problem one game, this was when I was vsing a Teemo at top. I got rekt and really annoyed because he kept on zoning me away from the creeps, so that I couldn&#039;t get them. It was very frustrating and Before I knew it, he one shot me when i tried to go for a quick combo. Can anyone give me a few tips on how to win this matchup?","replies":[{"poster":"Hansley01","date":"2017-01-29T08:59:36.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get your shield first, you Q second. You want to shield yourself to go in and last-hit, then go back to safety using 1,2 maybe 3 Qs. Rinse and repeat.\n\nAt lvl 6 press R and smash your keyboard and win.Even easier if the jungler ganks. Rush a hexdrinker to survive.\n\nAs a note; pay attention to the distance between you and the Teemo. If he presses W and goes in he might deal serious damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Arventus","date":"2017-01-31T20:44:13.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ty for the response your tips really helped me vs those cancer ass teemo mains.","replies":[]}]}]}
