If you're having tech issues from time to time, shit happens and Riot knows that, but if it's happening a lot the responsibility falls on you to do what you can to fix it. \n\nOnto your issue though, bugsplats can be caused by a whole lot of things so there's a lot to try and work out. \n\nIf it's happening when you first get into game, I'd first recommend not alt tabbing during loading, especially i you use true fullscreen. It messes with the loading of the game (esp on low end machines) and can cause crashes and the like.\n\nIf you notice it's happening when you have a particular other thing open, close that thing.\n\nIf it happens randomly, the first thing to try is repairing your client. Once in the client (logged in) got to settings, and then \"initiate full repair\".\n\nThere are some things a simple repair won't fix though, so if that doesn't fix your issue then I'd recommend reinstalling the game with the Hextech repair Tool.\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends","replies":[]}]}
