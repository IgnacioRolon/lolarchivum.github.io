After all, you're the same rank as them.\n\nSo how do you get out of Bronze? Simple. This is going to sound insulting, but keep in mind that I was the bottom of Bronze too when I started the game. How do you get out of Bronze (or Silver for that matter)? By learning the basics of the game.\n\nYou will feel like you have a good grasp on the game now, but you certainly don't. Or else you'd be Gold or high Silver. Go back to basics. Practice CSing in customs. Study the rules of trading. Focus harder on preventing deaths. Learn good ward placement. Consider which items to build situationally rather than following a cookie-cutter build (e.g. build armor to counter physical dmg, build MR to counter magic dmg). Start watching the map. Make plays on objectives at the right times (when you have a numbers advantage due to jungle ganking the other side of the map, for instance).\n\nThese things sound simple, but no Bronze player does more than 1 or 2 of them to any level of competency. If they did, they'd be high Silver minimum.","replies":[{"poster":"Tekken Lord","date":"2015-08-30T02:09:37.052+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, good and solid advice, I didn't even know there were rules for trading, will look them up now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-08-30T07:45:14.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"play supp and ward a fuckton{{item:2043}}","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-08-31T12:06:31.950+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I laughed.\n\nCause this is a waste of gold in bronze, no bronzie looks at the map.","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-09-01T02:45:07.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe they dont look at the minimap very often.
