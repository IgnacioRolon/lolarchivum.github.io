But his e lives up to the name **DEATH RAY** 1 hitting the jinx, 1 hitting the syndra, 1 hitting the blasted little mongrel no one likes, 1 hitting everything except for dedicated tanks, which you can still 3 hit. My end build on him persists with 1400+ ap, and his q aa gets a nice 100% ap ratio + the 313 base damage off of it, You can aa the enemy adc to kill them if you get close enough, with 1400 ap and a full combo of everything he can get a total of 7435, and seeing as most of the output is aoe, he can decimate enemy team just by himself, meaning that the rest of his team work as a cleanup crew. \n\nwith the final build containing a ludens echo and lich bane;\n\nRelevant math: \n103 + (210 + 1400) +  (120 + 280) + ((250 + 980)*****1.40) + 770 + (185*****14) + 240 = 7435 damage total to a single target,  5322 is the overall aoe damage he can do. \n\n(not including -% penetration or +% penetration (-% penetration allows units to take more damage than the actual spell does by a % (eg, krugs or super minions(this effect can be applied to champions with a high enough base or % magic pen(also works for physical damage)))))\n\nP.s. don't wtf my lazer of Viktory","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-09-12T07:46:33.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm gonna be honest, I've just woken up, and most of that maths I'm feeling too lazy right now to double check (plus I suck at Maths and I dropped it in year 11). But he's MEANT to be one shotting squishies, that's what he does, mind you, I've never seen a Viktor one shot anyone with JUST an E FROM 100%, but that's LITERALLY his role dude, he kills squishies. People complain about Zed, Leblanc, Talon, Fizz and so on, one shotting them, but that's literally what they're made for. I've seen and played lots of Viktor (what the hell do you mean you don't see him often enough lmao) and I've never seen his E do more than 70% of a target's health. And I've seen Viktors who were like literally 5 levels ahead of everyone and 12 kills up from everyone PRE nerf and I've never ever ever once seen that. I think most of what you said is a bit exaggerated. Not to mention he has no mobility and apart from his E, he doesn't have the best range so he should be incredibly easy to deal with, and normally is in my experiences. From memory, I only remember one or two Viktors ever giving me massive issues in game, and none that have given me any issues post nerf. \n\nAnd show me ANY champion that gets 740 AP with no Deathcap at 3 items and I'll buy you a fucking cake.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-09-12T09:08:19.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"viktor with ap scaling runes, lv 18 with stacked mej, ap pot, someone using zeke (not his item, so technically 3), seraph(with mana mastery), baron, dragon and his fully upgraded default item (and a used ap pot doesn't count as an item technically)\n\nalso, the point of the text before was saying he can team melt, tanks aswell as squishies","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-09-12T09:53:40.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What kind of player gets to level 18, on three items?\n\nWhat kind of players builds Mejai's, Seraph's Embrace AND fully upgrades his Hex Core as their first three items on Viktor?\n\nLiterally none of those conditions you mentioned in the first paragraph is a common occurrence in your casual ranked game. You build those three items on ANY champ and you could get a similar result. That's like me saying Veigar is OP because he could get 80000000000000000 AP with NO items, come on dude, forreal?\n\nAlso, Viktor does not 3 hit dedicated tanks. Maybe if the tank had ONLY armour and no health or MR, but then that tank would be pretty fucking stupid. He doesn't have any built in MR pen or Health% damage in his kit and he doesn't have any crazy sustained damage, apart from his Q due to it's low cooldown late game (and if he was constantly only using that on a tank than the enemy team would be rejoicing), so he also, does not melt tanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-09-12T10:25:29.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok when I say 3 hit, im not including the actual active throw part of q, because that's like throwing stuffed teddies, counting the ray and 2 q aa procs with lich, also considering he has void rod, for around  a 2-3 sec duration for the whole lot, because as you said its a low cd on its own lategame, then there is the bonus cdr with also helps.\n\nAlso I never said ranked(although being 14/0 with a mej in ranked was nice) it's more for fun in normal, you know, like leo top\n\nalso, no other champion gets a free 180 ap from their passive\n\nexcept maybe Cassiopeia if you stacked enough ap items\n\nAnd I not saying the only items at level 18 would be that, I just said that you actually do get that from the 3 items","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-09-12T10:48:09.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, even like 5 Lich Bane'd Q's with both the parts with void staff with a full 6 item Viktor wouldn't kill a 6 item Maokai with balanced tank stats. \n\nWell yeah ok, I guess you didn't say Ranked but there are plenty of crazy OP fun things you can do in normals, but no one really cares about it. All I meant was that, while 740 AP no Dcap with three items on Viktor may be possible, it's highly unlikely that it'll happen without lots of planning, good conditioning and probably won't happen in your average ranked games with non-retarded opponents. \n\nIt's not free. Not even slightly. It costs 3000 to get it fully upgraded. Veigar has the potential to get 10 times that much AP from a passive and it's ACTUALLY for free, HE isn't OP. \n\nViktor isn't OP man. He's balanced right now, he's just a strong meta pick because of his versatility and lane dominance. Sure he has a shittone of burst and ends up with slightly more AP than most other AP mids but he has no mobility, he doesn't have the best range and he only has three damaging abilities. Not to mention that most recent nerfs to Viktor shifted his power spike until WAY later into the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-09-12T22:50:39.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you said 190% I was trying to show you 200% all that really was\n\nhe has stronger late game than he used to\n\nalso, that's because maokai r, but if you full combo and use lich q twice can kill him\n\nan overall scale of 533% ap or something like that","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-09-13T08:22:48.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trying to show me 200%?
