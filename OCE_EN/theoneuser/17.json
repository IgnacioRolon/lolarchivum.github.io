CDR is also important so that you can have e up constantly (requires 37.5% cdr) since her lategame damage is crippled if e is on cd, especially with ad builds. AD is much weaker midgame because none of the good AD items give cdr and none of them are very good standalone items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-11-07T13:03:18.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Go full Ap with 2 attack speed items. {{item:3115}} {{item:3085}} {{item:3158}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3135}}. You can choose to buy zhonya's instead of buying a lich bane or just depend on your ult which have a really low cooldown if you have 40% CDR. Other than that u can swap out ionian boots for Mpen boots if u have scaling CDR runes or when you can have the blue buff. I wouldn't recommend going AD on kayle because of the lack of CDR AD items and most of kayle's skills scales with AP.  Another option is to play on-hit kayle with {{item:3931}} {{item:3115}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3158}} {{item:3091}} {{item:3085}}. You might want to swap something in the on hit build for a defensive item because you kinda don't need that much attack speed because you will already be at around max attack speed with 4 of the attack speed items.","replies":[]}]}
