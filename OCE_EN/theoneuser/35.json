If you look at their match history and its super average, chances are they are a liar.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-02T03:29:12.082+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"no I think he means that depending on what time of day and week you do your placements, after the first 1 or 2 games which will almost always be bronze-silver, if you win those two  you can sometimes get 8 or so games where you get matched with people from really high gold to low diamond and even if you only win 30% and get carried, by just focusing on not feeding and picking a simple and passive support like say soraka or braum and just playing as passively as possible; you'll end up in an elo much higher than you should really be since you'll win alot of mmr but lose very little for losses and end up getting placed like high gold or something. Although they generally drop reasonably quickly after that if they continue playing ranked. Depending on when you do your placements (especially in oce with low server numbers) you can get placed in a much higher elo than you deserve somewhat easily.\n\nI don't see how this issue could be remedied though outside of the decay rate that is already being implemented. Though I do feel even lower elos should decay as well but at a very very slow rate so if you only do your placements and then don't play any ranked within like 4-5 months you'd have dropped a fair bit like 4 tiers of an elo bracket.","replies":[{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2016-09-02T10:30:29.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yup you got it","replies":[]}]}]}]}
