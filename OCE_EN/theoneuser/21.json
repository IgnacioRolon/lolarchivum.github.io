(won't be surprised to see riven appear midway through worlds)\n\nidk what to think but for now, much op many wow rito nerf pls \n\n\n\nsorry for excessive rant + wall of text (though this adds to it :P)","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-10-06T21:53:05.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a bug BTW, **Riot** is looking to fix it by at least the next patch. \n\nMore info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/56224t/with_the_new_620_patch_riven_can_get_an_insane/d8fqd3c).","replies":[{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2016-10-07T03:51:35.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for clearing things up!","replies":[]}]}]}
