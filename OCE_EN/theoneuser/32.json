Despite scripters even appearing in games Riot were in they assumed it was skill, yes... skill. \n\nThat bronzeV person was now able to kite with challenger mechanics, yet still stuck in bronze due to their awful knowledge of the game. It took Riot about 3 years to finally do something and they did a few ban waves, but we all know the people coding the script client s are smarter than the people making the anti-cheat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2015-04-14T01:10:11.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not many.

Honestly oz has them but not that many. Maybe the smaller game population gives bots fewer places to hide and they are called out very quickly. Also, there is a distinction between a scripter and a bot - scripters use third party programs to pull off combos perfectly every time. Bots just farm ip by pure volume and dgaf if they win or lose.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Maximum Spice","date":"2015-04-14T01:39:47.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty sure i saw a cass yesterday script but its really not very common.","replies":[{"poster":"Yuudachi","date":"2015-04-14T03:04:05.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Aeror","date":"2015-04-14T03:20:00.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cass is one of the most known champions to excel with scripts, it's rare to see one but a scripting Cass isn't out of the ordinary.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-04-14T02:33:53.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AHAHAH LOL @ THE SCRIPTURES","replies":[]},{"poster":"redorkulator","date":"2015-04-14T02:31:58.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those are both some pretty obvious examples, tbh I didn't even know you could do this until recently.
