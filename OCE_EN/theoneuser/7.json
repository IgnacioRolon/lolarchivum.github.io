Make sure they are out of activation range though. Walk to gromp and kill it with smite once your placed 2 at blue. Once you are done your box is ready to place another at blue. carefully aggro the blue by attacking a small minion once then run away, dragging the buff out into the line of boxes. Attack it while the boxes tank, if its done right you take almost no damage (1 hit maybe).","replies":[{"poster":"IIpsycheII","date":"2015-02-06T01:31:37.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A couple of things. \nYou should get blue smite on shaco, no questions asked. If you want to farm you are playing the wrong champ. You need to be out ganking, and chilling smite is super useful in that situation.\nAlso, how I play shaco is always start red (clearly you don't need a leash) then go to the other junglers red/blue, depending on where they started. \nFrom here, you can either wait for them (places boxes in locations so that if they try and run, they get feared) or you can do their buff (assuming that they don't have fast clear, i.e rengar). \nThis way one of three things happens. \nYou take their buff, not that big of a deal, but the xp loss for the enemy will be annoying. \nYou try and kill them, they burn a flash.\nYou kill them.\nThere are no other outcomes and I haven't found a better shaco strat yet.","replies":[{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-02-10T19:29:56.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The blue smite isnt actually that useful on shaco. It lets you clear fast pre hydra, and clear instantly once you have hydra. The faster you can clear the more ganks you get. It is also the best fast counterjungling item. Blue smite really doesnt add too much to a shaco gank, because due to invis you will already be on top of them, and once you are on top of them they are slowed. Red smite is also viable on shaco, but I dont really like it.\n\n\nGoing to their buff is pretty obvious shaco strat, the enemy jungler can just start at that camp, or even set a trap for you there.\n\nIf you become predictable as shaco you will get outplayed. A lot of junglers (literally all) are stronger than him early he relies on getting the jump on them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DatEpicPotato","date":"2015-01-28T11:49:26.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally when I play shaco jungle I spam boxes at red, smite krugs but not kill it, kill red, then immediately go kill blue, then gank as on as possible, but this is a very risky and aggressive route.","replies":[{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-01-28T21:11:07.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you mean their blue?

There are many ways you can go about Jungling and Ganking.\nDepending on where you start and what champion you are using to Jungle there are many different routes and paths you can take. From the path you are describing by starting Golems. I would usually run the route of Golem (smite on spawn), red buff. Ideally, depending on the mid lane situation Gank mid then move onto Blue buff or wolves with smite and B.

You also don't always have to start Krugs and you don't have to clear 1 side only.\n\nSome people prefer Krugs (smite) - Red - Wolves (smite). And use the wolf ward buff to watch if their blue gets stolen.\n\nThe point of doing 3 camps and backing is trying to avoid using any pots (or only 1) and having enough money for upgraded smite and wards/pots.\n\nDepends who you play too.\n\nIt is a HUGE waste to do krugs - red - blue.\n1. your wasting your smite on smiting the blue when you dont need to.\n2. Getting blue then backing is pointless. Blue is used so you dont go oom in the jungle, you waste 20 seconds or so of blue buff when you do it then back immediately.\n\nIf you're really set on camp - buff - buff change your order. Do Gromp - Blue - Red. Since red gives you health back when you smite it.\n\nSome people like starting red, then ganking at level 2. its unexpected and can usually blow a flash.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-01-28T05:21:08.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"depends on who but mostly avoid raptors early(they hurt) unless you are going to b if not go to blue you should be half hp if you play right then gank","replies":[]}]}
