You should be happy for the good fortune of others. yes this skin would probably do an actual Riven main alot of good, but that is irrelevant. In this case, the gift is doing OP some good.","replies":[{"poster":"Wast3land ","date":"2016-09-25T09:00:59.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm gonna say the same thing my mum said to the doctor when i was born \" Is there a return policy? \"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wast3land ","date":"2016-09-25T03:57:03.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"K","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2016-09-25T06:57:49.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hilarious. made my day","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2016-09-24T02:38:36.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait was dat the birthday gift?","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-09-24T03:42:29.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably, if you already have riot kayle then they would give you a mystery skin instead.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Loughlin","date":"2016-09-23T23:34:02.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you being sarcastic?
