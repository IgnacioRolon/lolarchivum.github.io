It allows a Top Laner to check for Teleport opportunities, a Jungler to easily survey the landscape and, as you've already said, can improve map awareness and your ability to target beyond the edge of your screen. \n\nAs with anything in League though, it requires practice. Having played the game for nearly 6 years I'll admit that I sometimes manage to push the mouse too far to a side and end up losing track of where I am. However, most of the time it is a major reason why I was able to assist my team in time or barely escape a gank.\n\nIt definitely isn't for everyone, just as playing locked gives me a headache, but if you can manage to add it to your repertoire of skills you'll more than occasionally notice the benefits.

You'll get around it sooner or later.\n\nA couple tricks to use in unlocked screen that might benefit the players:\n\n* The Space key is defaulted to bring the camera back to your character in the unlocked screen mode. So you can always look elsewhere to scout or whatever and press Space to immediately jump the camera back to you afterwards. Also, during unlocked screen mode, holding the Space key would function identically as locked screen for the duration of the holding.\n* When using spells with large range, such as Pantheon's R: You could move your camera to the destination to which you wanna cast the spell to move the character to, and hover your cursor over the R (or any spell) without pressing it which the range of your spell will be displayed visually onto the game hence you can physically see how far the destination is from the included range. This is useful to help one plan long ranged assaults across the map for the champions that can do it without having to guess your precise range or being restricted to probing around the minimap every single time.","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2017-01-02T17:26:48.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">=> RTS players or those who've had experiences with the genre generally familiarise themselves with the unlocked screen much easier.\n\nPersonally i'm an RTS player who prefers the locked screen.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-01-09T00:53:41.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im an RTS player who while making one good play (in RTS's) loses a majority of my army elsewhere","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2017-01-09T06:33:12.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally i was the RTS player using the key bindings to map to all my troops and cycling through them quite often, which is probably why i prefer lock screen.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-01-09T12:31:39.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait, there are key binds to the map -_-, and what RTS player r u, im a dow one (a bad one at that)","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2017-01-09T21:35:00.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've played plenty, the main one i played a lot of was AoE.\n\nAnd yes you generally have the ability to use ctrl+insert number here to make certain troops/buildings come up when you  later use that number.\n\nThat's generally how i always run my RTS's.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-01-10T00:56:58.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"firstly this has become some kind of mini thread\nsecondly, i played aoe, was alright at that\nthirdly, i didnt know you were talking about the squad select, i do that to get my soldiers shooting what i want specifically\nfourthly, is this unrelated reply reply reply whatever u call it allowed to be this long XD","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Gloric","date":"2017-01-05T12:08:31.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have more of an issue losing my damn mouse cursor in-game when a teamfight pops off all of a sudden.\n\nI move it around a little, and i'm like \"why am I panning, it was just on top of trynd, now i'm off towards bot lane\".

It locks it so long as you are holding it.\n\n\nExactly this. \n\nAlso try lowering your panning speed. I'm fairly certain you can only change this while in a match, so start up an empty custom match and try different speeds to see if a slower one than the default is more comfortable. \n\nKeep in mind, pressing spacebar will snap your screen to focus your Champion (it will not always be in the direct centre, for example, if you are near the 'top' of the map, your Champion will appear slightly higher than the centre so that more of the playable map is displayed). \nAlong with using your spacebar, just when you are returning to lane or rotating, you should want to look at the focus of the map (maybe bot lane if you're a top laner with teleport, or dragon pit if you're returning to mid or bot), while also keeping track of your Champion on the minimap as well. Becoming familiar with the minimap and using it as frequently as possible will just help your macro play out immensely. \n\nAnother quick tip, you can also lock your screen to your teammates by using the F1 through to F5 keys, I'm not sure if the F keys refer to the position of your teammates on the scoreboard, but it's so helpful to quickly glance at your other teammates and their situation for deciding on ganks and roams as a jungler, and even as a laner. \n\nGood luck on the Rift fellow Summoner :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"OCE Yisus","date":"2017-01-02T23:40:19.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I usually use unlocked screen, but I do switch to unlocked when playing champs like kalista and twitch, where you are needed to move a lot and focus on yourself a lot more","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-01-02T14:20:06.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I use a Razer Naga, all my abilities/items/etc are bound to the buttons on the side of the mouse with ALT/SHIFT/CTRL being used for modifiers.\n\nThis frees up a hand to use the arrow keys to move the screen.","replies":[{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2017-01-02T14:49:19.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I use a $5 dell xD","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-01-02T15:36:22.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're going to play a game where you are at it for long periods of time, you're best off getting decent equipment.\n\nA form fitting gaming mouse, a keyboard with wrist support, and a comfortable and supporting chair.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"gimble","date":"2017-01-02T12:27:41.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes\nJust keep playing unlocked... the more you play the more comfy you will be.\nAlso, what may help... is if you have a gaming mouse adjust the sensitivity to make moving the map easier.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pured","date":"2017-01-09T07:47:00.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Unlocked will always be better.\nI myself play locked.
