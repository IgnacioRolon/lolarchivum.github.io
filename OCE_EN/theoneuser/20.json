What would be the best way to go about this?\nWould starting a new account to learn in a more positive environment help?","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2017-01-11T10:57:44.206+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a thresh, #1 would be landing your hook. Easiest way to do this, is to know all about [trading stance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iko2tqmDpJQ) (it helps when you play any other champion as well).\n A TL;DR of this would be \"When trying to land any kind of skill shot watch your creeps + wait for the enemy to last hit them. They may move randomly in lane, but will always go for last hits, which makes them predictable. This takes some timing to get right, and knowledge of the enemy's range to know where they'll stop to auto.\"\nKeeping in mind, just because you could hook someone doesn't mean you should. what is your mana/health like? What about your ADC? where is your jg? Where is their jg? item/exp advantage? The list goes on. Being aware of all these factors and having a sound knowledge of cooldowns for most botlane champions goes a long way in being a good support. \n\nAlso check out some [high elo thresh tips ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiTDPPf5ua0)as well as g[eneral support tips. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/4gdwjc/the_ultimate_list_of_support_tricks_in_season_6/)\n\nWhen it comes to people flaming you, just ignore them. As someone who practically feeds their way to level 6 mastery (and is a support main), I know it can be pretty hard to do this and having someone in lane with you to see you constantly screw up (who then decides to be a ♥ ♥ ♥ and start /all chat flaming you) definitely doesn't make it any easier. Just know that eventually with enough practice you will start seeing the results you want. You will know your matchups and how far you can push your champion with your skill. You know your ability more than your ADC and more than your team. Just because they are telling you to do something, doesn't mean you should if you think it won't go well. Risk taking in some cases is good, but too many can easily throw a game. \n\n\n> Would starting a new account to learn in a more positive environment help?\nStarting a new account for a more \"positive\" environment will likely not help, as most people down there are smurfs and will rage at you anyway. A more efficient way of learning is to play in a 5man with some friends (hit up the [team board](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment) or [join a club](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/clubs) if you need to).","replies":[{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2017-01-11T12:29:06.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a quick question: What would you recommend to to do when ahead?

If your jungler is around bot side all the better for you, even if you can't gank mid you can probs take dragon (or at least vision control of the area).\n\nI'm sure Yaia has some more tips for ya tho :P Just wanted to throw in my 2 cents as a support main.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2017-01-10T06:05:47.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as a thresh, its generally better to save your hook for either a counter engage or to stop a dash, rather than using it to engage, try going and flaying them instead, this will give enough time to line up and hit a hook on them no sweat unless they flash. if your adc is bad, or wants you gone, yeah just rush mobis and try and gank other lanes, if you arent comfy with that just stay in lane and mute them. a good support can make an average adc shine, where as the same is not true for an average support and good adc, thresh is good for disengage too, so if you arent keen on going hyper aggro, start the ancient coin and build into talisman of acension. gives you armour instead of hp but the trade off is you dont have to last hit minions for your adc and you can wait for an engae to come, or a gank.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-10T10:45:24.175+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"extra tips is that just like blitz, the hook cooldown being up can be threatening and also try to wait as long as possible before recasting deathsentence to get the most cc out of it. If you want to land hooks, it's better to wait till the enemy casts an ability with a long windup or goes for an aa animation. Against a Caitlynn + Sona this will be whenever cait tries to use her q, or when sona goes for an empowered auto since both of these windups can really make it harder for them to dodge the hook. On a counternote, the hook has a long windup so be careful since often the harass you'll take during the cast windup can lose you the trade or all in so be careful when you hook.\n\nAlso obviously, you don't have to go in for every hook, also try casting flay in the opposite direction to drag the enemy back slightly further. Manage your empowered autos since they make good harass whilst the enemy is csing and of course,  buying a control ward or red trinket and just waiting in the lane bushes is a great earlygame tactic since it allows you to have fun fly fishing with your hook and also can help zone the enemy of their cs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Belrick","date":"2017-01-10T06:56:38.685+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My 2cents\nThresh sets up picks.

We're humans, we make mistakes. By learning at your own pace means you learning the game itself and the champ (also playing one role ties itself into another role) When you listen to toxic people or people who completely dont know how to play thresh or support can weigh you down on how you play, think and decision making.  Depending what type of person you are, you might even begin to think \"oh the person is right I shouldnt play thresh\" etc or just tilt in general.  Everyone was a noob when they first began, you're fine new or pro to the champ. Eventually you'll get better thats what you need to think. \n2) Thresh is all about timing, positioning and predictions. If you can predict your enemies then perfect -> easy hooks easy life easy peel. Timing -> when to go in, when to poke, when to engage and when to disengage etc. Positioning, well you get the idea.\n3) I think thresh going against poke lanes is a 50/50 chance of win,lose or go even. I used to play an aggressive thresh. Being aggressive doesnt mean landing a hook or engaging etc. Depending on runes if you have a tanky set dont be afraid to throw in some autoattacks and trade, you dont need an adc thats hyperaggressive. If the adc knows you're going in they will follow or trade but then again depends on the person.\n4) Comboing -> is limitless. You dont have to start hook in first you can use other combos such as a flash ( to reposition) hook/flay-> ulti or Flash (to get in range) e or ulti (to flay into you or lock them in, can ulti and flay into the ulti) or Flay -> ulti -> hook (if they flash out) etc.\n5) Roaming as a support isnt as bad as you think, thresh does have a good roam sort of style, if you're good at roaming then by all means do it but make sure your adc is fine in lane (wards etc). Its good to have pressure on the map.\nAs to starting a new account ima say maybe. I sometimes start new accounts to try new champions and not care what people say or do because its a smurf and really just to do it for fun. It's also good to learn the champion itself when you're just trying random or new stuff out.  \n\nSorry if this doesnt make sense i sort of just rushed it D:","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pured","date":"2017-01-10T07:05:05.101+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I suggest not playing thresh if you aren't that skilled.

Unlike thresh or blitz, if you land a hook, you're 100% forced to follow up, so you're going to need a very attentive and aggressive adc with you, or you're going to have to be able to look for only winning hooks, ping a hook and then make sure you land it and not waste everyones time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LilMil","date":"2017-01-10T11:23:27.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"spam morgana ez monie","replies":[]}]}
