I also changed all the files in my Config folder to 'read only' so the client and subsequent client updates cannot change them so a lot of what I had back then still is set that way now. Even running a repair on the client can't revert them back to 'default' ie I don't lose my Custom Item Sets. \nI changed quite a few things over the years, including the way the camera would snap back to you on respawn (this also has since been added into the ingame settings) and I also changed the RGB settings making my health bar bright pink - this was before having Colour Blind mode made it yellow - because I had issues 'finding' myself in teamfights. I also used to use a 3rd party app created by a guy called Yurixy to skin the SR map. This wasn't against any rules btw. The skin was called 'Night Beach' which was a nice twilight shaded skin with lots of blues and the actual lanes and paths through the jungle were sand rather than grass though the jungle was still 'jungle' and bushes were still grass lol. Champs stood out a lot more due to the subdued lighting effect of the skin as their models are overlaid on the maps by the game itself and their brightness and colours did not change. This was a lot easier on my eyes than the bright green SR usually is after I played around with the gamma a bit. Subsequent SR Map updates have made this app unusable unfortunately.\n\n\nBut, in response to your question, having Attack Move on the left click has helped a LOT, it even got me an amazing penta :D I don't find it clunky at all but I'm not sure if it's because there's a difference between way the game recognises and executes commands from the ingame settings (how you change that setting now ingame) versus how it reads/read it from the game config files (how I set it up years ago before PersistedSettings or changing the setting ingame was even a thing). I did not notice any difference in performance (any clunky-ness), in a 'before and after' way, when Riot enabled that setting ingame even though my ingame settings have not changed and are default (they look standard even though there is a lot changed) because all my game settings are received and read by Riot from the .json and .ini files on my PC, rather than the other way around. \n\nAnd yes, it works amazingly well on Kalista :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-09-04T07:31:36.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's clunky until you get used to it, and it helps with fast orbwalking, rather than precision.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-09-04T07:29:36.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes its clunky","replies":[]}]}
