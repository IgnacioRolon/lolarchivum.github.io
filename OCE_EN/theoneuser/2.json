You can still be good and be casual and you can still be hardcore and not do very well. Its all a matter of perspective and what the individual wants.  Now If you could choose to make a living off of gaming i think a good % of the player base would love to.\n\nYou ask the question:  Is getting getting better & climbing up the ranked ladder worth the time ?....\nWell if you personally get satisfaction from doing so then yes, you enjoy seeing positive progression and love being challenged.\n\nTo play for fun: Well thats just it , to play for fun but you can still get better as you play as each time you are essentially practicing even just the basic's and you can find yourself doing well. But if you play bad and still enjoy the game for what it is then, no harm ( well to you anyway, maybe not your team haha ).\n\nI feel no matter what kind of player you are, that you should always enjoy yourself no matter what. Take the good with the bad and just do what makes you happy. If its progression and trying to be the best or just having a laugh and making friends, the biggest thing people forget is that your playing this game for you, for your enjoyment and entertainment, and i hope being a team game that you do this with the intent of being a positive player.\n\nanywho sorry for the book but just my 2c. ^_^","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2016-09-22T06:05:35.095+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this game worth it? Sure if you enjoy getting frustrated and annoyed by people with an IQ of ~30. I play a lot between game releases because it's quick, simple to get into a game and I really couldn't care less what happens. But as soon as new title is release Lol gets shelved and I don't touch it for a few months.\n\nI guess you could call me a filthy casual but I play ranked to win. If I want to piss fart around and have a bit of fun I jump in normals. I just wish others would share the same mentality and outlook instead of ruining other people's ranked games because they want to \"1st time teemo\" in ranked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-09-22T05:34:33.438+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been playing since Season 3, and I haven't played seriously for a long time.
