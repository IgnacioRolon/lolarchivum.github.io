(I&#039;ve noticed that one cycle through the videos of each champ uses up 60mb)\n\n* Not being able to minimize the friends list\n\n* Too fancy/slow; It&#039;d be nice if there was an option to not load images (or something like that) \n\n* Random animation bugs in-game (e.g. Amumu ult animation remaining on map after being used)\n\n- A lot less profile info &amp; no item sets \n- Large game folder size (went up to over 10gb from 6gb)\n- Having to reinstall every few weeks","replies":[]}
