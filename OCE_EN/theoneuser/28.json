YES I AM a passionate supporter of ARAM and YES I AM greatly grateful for Riot&#039;s introduction of the snowball to the game mode.\r\n\r\nWhat I am proposing:\r\n- A ranking system in ARAM that is similar to that in normal (does not affect mmr or matchmaking)\r\n- No changes to gameplay or the champion select screen to keep the simplicity of the game mode(no bans, still blind pick)\r\n- End of season icons + loading screen border based on ranks (only visible in ARAM)\r\n\r\nI&#039;m sure this&#039;ll get ignore yet again but I still hope that it&#039;ll become a thing in LoL. \r\nFeel free to leave thoughts below and upvotes are greatly appreciated so that riot sees this :)","replies":[{"poster":"NeilPatrickVarus","date":"2015-05-03T11:16:46.171+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're an idiot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-05-03T04:55:07.659+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The worst thing you can do with a random based game mode is make it competitive.","replies":[{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-05-03T11:46:17.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much this.
