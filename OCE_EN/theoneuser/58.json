I find just charging in pretty ineffective, with a bit of tankiness, u can walk half a screen back to turret b4 the ahri can kill u even if they charm.  As far as I can see, u q and get into position to e with the movement speed and then w, which deals a bit less than half theyre hp. however lategame. this doesn't do much unless ur fed. Hextech gunblade seems good with the extra dmg and active but not rly worth the cost(good as a last item?) anyways it should build out of WoTa. Nowadays I just see ahri.s standing in the back line and just pressing q, is this how ur supposed to play her?","replies":[]}
