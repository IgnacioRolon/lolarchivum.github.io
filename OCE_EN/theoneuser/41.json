Also, it often feels they play reactively and snap you up when you overstep. Still, you're right it isn't the same line-up and it's most **definitely** not the same opposition this year. \n\nI applaud you for taking a gamble. 99% of people are eliminated by one upset so best of luck to you and the Flash Wolves!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
