You have a Doran's Ring and a Tear and a Catalyst. You have 70 AP, you have 1000 Mana. (Numbers probably a bit off but it's okay for comparing).\n\nQ at rank 5 would do 185 (+31.5) (+30). This means it would do 246.5 magic damage.\n\nQ at rank 1 with an E would do 200% of 60 (+31.5) (+30). This means it would do 243 magic damage.\n\nSo it wins by 3.5 damage however, Q has longer range, and is the basis for E so even though E spreads, it spreads based on Qs damage when you do an E-Q.\n\nEs damage on it's own is not too good to max, plus early game it's more used to reset your Q and empower your E unless wave clearing which again is based on Qs damage.\n\nOverall better to max Q.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-08-12T12:32:49.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">So it wins by 3.5 damage however, Q has longer range, and is the basis for E so even though E spreads, it spreads based on Qs damage when you do an E-Q.\n\nIt wins by 3.5 damage, and your not taking into account the damage change due to E max (IE. what damage the E does in scaling)\n\nAlso your Q at level 9 will be level 2, with your E being 5.\n\nNot pretending i have any clue what to max, but your math isn't taking into account a bunch of things.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-08-12T14:47:43.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, all I missed the fact that E is level 2 so that would be 40% extra on the Q.\n\n246.5 + 55% = 382.075 with E damage bringing that up to 498.075 whilst E max is 85 (+31.5) (+30) which is 293 after the multiplication, plus the E damage is bringing that up to 484, so maybe Q does to more damage after all.\n\nOf course, Q is longer range and can be used 3 times as often as E.\n\nQ-W-Q-E-Q is the combo which allows for Q to be used three times and E once.\n\nThat's 246.5 + 246.5 + 382.075 = 739.5 damage.
