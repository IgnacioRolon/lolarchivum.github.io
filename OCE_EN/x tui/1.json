When i play in gold or higher she never sees any play time or gets fucked because, generally speaking, the team knows how to deal with her. A successful invade or early counter jungle would set her back heaps and keep pressure off the lanes. Constant counter jungling is also a good idea. I don&#039;t even buy pink wards anymore for her because she&#039;s weak as piss. \r\n\r\nAny other tips against Eve would be appreciated so the general population can see.\r\n\r\nThanks xo","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-09-23T11:37:19.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"besides not pink warding i dont know why she does so much better in lower elos. she really is so weak. no point in warding at all if every enemy is in their respective lane but if you really wanna keep track of her you can ward 1 of her buffs or another jungle camp at around 7-8 minutes and you'll see her when shes unstealthed. you could probably go and kill her too, its guaranteed with the help of a good jungler","replies":[{"poster":"x TUI","date":"2015-09-24T20:51:27.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think if you're that high an ELO you could probably make anything work for you. I found people skirmish without even considering Eve might be around. Warding her buffs is pretty effective","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"l2noob4ul","date":"2015-09-23T23:08:24.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"by no means is eve not played @ higher elo/get wrecked\ntheres a few eve mains in master/challenger\nLuha, myself, and some others i dont know the names of.\n\nthe only thing you can do as a laner is to buy pinks and ward AT camps, warding normally would do nothing and group early (the same as vs rengars)\n\nas a jungler, counterganking is the best way to shut down eve because she's weak in 1v1 or 2v2. counterjungling doesn't work as well since half the time the eve is trying to counterjungle you or purposely avoiding you if you are a strong jungler\n\n\nreason she's so good at lower elos is because she can snowball hard against people who don't adapt their styles to the situation. 10-2 eve? no problem, i'll just keep shoving this lane and if i die, im gonna blame my jungler for not coming.","replies":[]}]}
