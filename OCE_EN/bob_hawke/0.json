You might get a diamond 1 Jax smurf on your team, but you'll probably have a challenger lee sin and a diamond 2 sona on the enemy team. The fact is that normal games are so painful to play when you have one or two members of the enemy team who absolutely stomp your entire team. And these enemies are obviously of higher caliber than the playes on your team.\nSo can someone please fix the normal games.
