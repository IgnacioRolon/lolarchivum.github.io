And if youre not playing teh game properly, why should you be playing with the rest of us who are?\n\nPlus you have the usual issues of if their champ gets picked/banned by the enemy team, _(which happens a lot, seeming one-tricks usually one-trick champs like Yasuo or Riven or Katarina etc. [like seriously when was the last time you saw a Zilean one trick? or a Nidalee?])_. And when their champ does get banned, they instantly dodge and ruin all the strategic work the rest of the team has done, securing picks and bans. And if they have already dodged too many times recently and HAVE to play, then they can't do shit, and are just a burden.\n\nLearn to play multiple champs, like the rest of us.\nYou can play and be _good_ at at _least_ 2-3 champs per position with relative ease.\n\nOne-tricking is just a shortcut to rank up to an elo where you dont actually belong. _(90% of one-trick would fall out of their ranks in days if their champ was taken away.)_ they don't actually belong at that rank, their game knowledge and skill is not of that level, they're just mechanically very good with one champ.\n\nSo yea, not fond of them. ^^","replies":[]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-05-12T02:21:07.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think they're pieces of shit.
