We are definitely going to investigate as soon as its reported through the correct channel. Behaviour like that is 100% not acceptable in our community.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-05-13T07:48:03.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only accepted to see where his attitude would go and and it was apparent straight away. \nBut no worries will also head there.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-05-12T23:03:09.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Marauder wants to check the game logs for that one, was around 830am today.\n\nSorry for the naming, but it's all there.","replies":[]}]}
