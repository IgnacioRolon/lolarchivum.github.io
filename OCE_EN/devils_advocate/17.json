Why isn&#039;t there a basketball team \n\nSo we started spit balling ideas back and forth with great amusement and i came up with the idea...\n\nWhy isn&#039;t there a League basketball team?\n\nTrying to keep in mind the fact a team is 5 players in basketball this would be ideal, you may of course use 6 or 7 champs with basketball skins as you have a referee / substitute / coach.\n\nHowever.... Here was my idea\n\n(shooting guard) 3Point Master Morgana - Your Q now tosses a long range basketball at the enemy, on impact with enemy champ, buzzer sound goes off.\n(Centre) \nBlock Master Cho&#039;Gath- Wear&#039;s a basketball jersey of course, 4 arms, at full size... When he gains a kill, voices the line &quot;Deeeenieeed!&quot; or to honor one of our favorite childhood games (rioters, i know your my age) &quot;Get that outa here!&quot;  of course done in the classic cho'gath semi whine he has, just matter of factly in gentleman style \"Get...That...Out...Of...Here\" (NBA Jam &lt;3) \n(Power Forward)\nDunkmaster Darius - Already in game\n(point guard)\nFreeThrow Master Ryze/Annie- i was having trouble with this one, i was thinking annie because she&#039;s small an maybe  reuse of her fireball could work, or perhaps Ryze also using his Q. \n(Small Forward) \nThis was tricky, i as thinking of perhaps fighers/adc&#039;s here, as im trying to keep the team roles balanced for effective metas/usual play styles....\n\nUdyr? Echo? Quinn even, could move Morg into point guard, quinn into 3 point master to balance teams a bit, making your melee jg a small forward.\n\nThoughts and ideas? \n\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}}","replies":[{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-04-21T18:41:04.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, why isn't Lee Sin have a football/soccer theme?
