After 28h of issues, no reply from ticketing Riot i decided to do my own research and go through multiple forums and potential issues. Here&#039;s what i found to fix my issues.\r\n\r\nAdobe Air! For alot of you whom have bought a laptop in the last 10months or so with Windows 10, you may be shocked to realize. Your system may still run LoL, but it is a game which uses adobe air support. Be sure you have this installed on your system! \r\n\r\nAdobe Air Link: https://get.adobe.com/air/\r\n\r\nInternet Settings: You may or may not have this already done, when i compared i found my settings didn&#039;t match Riots request of how it should be set up... Do the following\r\n\r\nControl Panel &gt; Internet Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Scroll down to security &gt; Be sure that these two boxes are checked! &quot;Use SSL 3.0 and TSL 1.0&quot;\r\n\r\nAs a windows 10 user, i double checked to make sure my service pack was up to date (it was!)\r\n\r\nThese are the 3 issues i found where my system didn&#039;t match Riots recommendations. Once i changed these, i have received my Hextech  Chest and loot, opened and received my skin (Heartseeker {{champion:22}} )\r\n\r\nNow get back into your games once you&#039;ve made sure these settings and adobe air is installed have been done and enjoy your Hextech release!\r\n\r\nHappy games ahead community!\r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}} {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[{"poster":"Suck these Meeps","date":"2016-03-27T05:23:31.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly this did not work for me, I'm still getting disconnected when i try and open my chests.

That being said, i've disabled alot of windows 10 extras i had no intention or thought i would use/need. Which i may have to double check also. \n\nWhat i don't quite follow is why Hextech loot/crafting is having these issues with pvp.net but no other area of league is. I can access store, friends etc... Just the hextech issue for me. It's a conundrum at the moment. \n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]}]}]}
