When i use the Hecarim skin, when i use that particular skin, when i loadin i get a gold border also to my champ art and ziggs doesn&#039;t? \r\n\r\nOtherwise Hecarim is 675 orange essence and Ziggs is 450, both are 1350rp store price. \r\n\r\nBut i really don&#039;t see the application in permanent or shard&#039;s if you don&#039;t own, don&#039;t they both just give you the skin?

For example, I have a Glacial Malphite which is an Epic Skin Shard that disenchants for 450 orange essence. I assume permanents disenchant for more since they are far rarer.\n\nI believe the difference between permanent and a skin shard is that a permanent can be redeemed (added to your collection) for 0 essence and a skin shard must be upgraded using the listed amount of essence. Again with the Malphite example, Glacial requires  1050 orange essence.
