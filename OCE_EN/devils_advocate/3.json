Riot ever going to tweak him down?","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ever going to technically &quot;nerf&quot; though Riot i&#039;m sure would prefer the term &quot;tone down&quot; Yasuo? His farm capacity, his damage output? his ability to go psycho 1v3 and still likely win due to cs dominance and ease on killing 4/5 of the champ pool as if they were minions?\r\n\r\nEven if you keep him down early, he&#039;ll still farm stupidly quick to bounce back late game with the same threat he always has, barely any other champ has his rebound ability even if camped early. \r\n\r\nI play a few champs that don&#039;t struggle as much vs Yasuo, but then again, it&#039;s Yasuo... Still bounces back or 1 mistake from me and he&#039;ll probably win a fight anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"ErÃ¸se","date":"2016-06-28T12:05:44.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chThbHaoLSM\n\n\n\nIt shows it here","replies":[{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-06-30T04:56:52.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=iAkeno,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=GiiRhEtV,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-06-28T12:05:44.281+0000)\n>\n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chThbHaoLSM\n> \n> \n> \n> It shows it here\n\noh my fucking god that into is edgy as hell","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-06-28T12:45:03.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=iAkeno,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=GiiRhEtV,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-06-28T12:05:44.281+0000)\n>\n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chThbHaoLSM\n> \n> \n> \n> It shows it here\n\nquite true, think they good, really not","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sulbatamol","date":"2016-06-29T06:08:34.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont worry . Every yasuo gets fed, return your favour by feeding one way or another.

That's my issue, is even a bad trader that realizes he needs items to just crush, it's similar to yi.... they just farm CS for said items and return with 500+ dmg Q's and ulti you which adds up to be over 1500dmg without including melee dmg most of the time. \n\nAnd we all know, if you're getting owned, just farm the weakest link on the enemy to even out a bit and still feel confident rather than enter fights itching to dash away from anything remotely looking at you, which will always be the downfall of any highrisk \"all in\"  fighter/assassin (Xin, Zed, Yasuo, Renek etc (i know dash out, humor me and say he dashed in for stun and didnt clip anything to proc a 2nd one, \"omg noob\" yeah yeah, just pretend that it happened and every non-perfect execution isn't flammable for once)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-06-28T21:27:48.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funny how Irellia gets toned down, yet is barely played, same concept stomped or does all the stomping, he may seem ok coz noobs make him look totally gimpy, but when irellia is in form, as is MID yasuo (top yasuo.... nice waste of your wall really in the current meta) vs most of the casters.\n\nSame with Zed, why isn't Zed in top more? He can do it.... \n\nBecause of their amazing kits vs mid. \n\nStupid dashes, ability to close gaps, lock downs or untargetable ultimates (talking all 3), yes its apart of their kit... but, honestly.... \n\nZed's been tweaked, Irelia just got tweaked, Yasuo needs to be tweaked also. His strengths in good hands aren't just good, its unbelievably amazing with next to no way to counter it when he's 200+ cs and the highest you've got is around 120cs on your team, he's already pushed lane, and the enemy team has begun team fighting non-stop.\n\nHell my first game was 15-6-15 or something in ARAM where i couldn't dodge, i had to go in.... you now, i just put my Q and E on autocast, and kept headbutting my keyboard looking at the screen for a split second before head butting my keypad again.. \n\nFirst time Yasuo gets an S.\n\nSure noobs may make him look like a joke, i'm not a general noob around the overall game. Playing vs him gave me enough ideas i didnt need to read tips or watch a video. But his strength in competent hands is far too high.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-06-28T14:15:11.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yas take quite a bit of mechanical skill to master and to carry games, not sure what Elo you're playing at but he is countered quite easily especially in the top lane","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-06-28T12:39:56.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funny, cause all the yasuo's i see are complete garbage, and generally get dumpstered over and over again, cause all they can do is go in.\n\nHonestly he is a stomp or be stomped champ, that has very little actual choice on whether he feeds or actually does well until it's WAY too late.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-06-28T12:43:05.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=GiiRhEtV,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-06-28T12:39:56.871+0000)\n>\n> Funny, cause all the yasuo&#x27;s i see are complete garbage, and generally get dumpstered over and over again, cause all they can do is go in.\n> \n> Honestly he is a stomp or be stomped champ, that has very little actual choice on whether he feeds or actually does well until it&#x27;s WAY too late.\n\nthey are, even if riot buffed his damage intensely, it would remain the same;\nA) people haven't got the skill to use him\nB) he is really susceptible to cc\nC) super easy to burst\nD) He has loads of counters\nE) he only has a few champions he actually counters compared to most other champs, he needs to have actual skill to outplay and win.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-06-28T12:51:30.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting, because i'm fairly sure what i said, even applies to pro play.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
