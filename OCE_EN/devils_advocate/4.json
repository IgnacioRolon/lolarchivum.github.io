A mature club for older players, people of proven maturity and non-toxic game play. \r\n\r\nExpectations; be able to disagree with logic and state intelligent reasoning not just &quot;omg your bronze, listen to eerything i say noob&quot; etc etc. Be able to accept, shit happens... This club isn&#039;t about boasting the best of the best to strut around. It&#039;s boasting people that can be non-toxic, be able to accept reality of situations, people have varied skill levels, life situations pop up etc. Be able to have fun whilst still trying to actually do the objectives. Predominately, people who don&#039;t get their ego from a video game, they have lives. We understand, some of us have kids, clingy pets, partners that rip out our Ethernet cables etc :P it happens. But find themselves unwilling to join a club because they dont want to receive flames or judgements about life happening. That being said, if someone declines your game invite, don&#039;t take it personal, sometimes (myself included) im not in the headspace or i feel that even though im around, a game may not be appropriate as i cannot give it the attention it requires.  \r\n\r\nIf this sounds like you, feel free to toss an ingame friends request and i&#039;ll slot you in.","replies":[{"poster":"Reaper22","date":"2016-04-22T07:00:12.137+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey i'm Lionx22 would love to join your club I've being looking for club for older people and here it is","replies":[{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-04-22T20:45:03.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dope77,realm=OCE,application-id=NjEElsTI,discussion-id=lTT2WQdQ,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-04-22T07:00:12.137+0000)\n>\n> hey i&#x27;m Lionx22 would love to join your club I&#x27;ve being looking for club for older people and here it is\n\nTried adding Lionx22 as a friend, my handle is the same. Toss me a friends invite to ToTaL ViRGiN and i'll slot you in, rather than pester me about inviting friends, if you have more than 1-2 you'd like to join. I'll just just shuffle officers later and you can bring them over. \n\nCan figure out any specific hassles later, i assume some maturity should be able to self regulate","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2017-04-02T22:26:44.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Found clubs to be ultimately an extended friends list, which being restricted to 50 members, may as well just categorise your friends list folders and move people around appropriately.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2017-04-02T22:26:10.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just an update- Unfortunately due to lack of participation from members. I've decided to close the club. \n\nPeople were still managing to either a) remain completely uninvolved and just sit around or b) join thinking that some requirements were met but we were here to carry and teach etc. or c) just honestly, dead... Didn't see a point to clubs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShiroeTheVillain","date":"2017-03-29T05:20:34.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hiya guys/gals is this club still up and running??","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2017-02-14T05:02:12.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Best bet is to speak with Twoheadedfreak, after about 6months of people coming, going and not really talking i walked away.

They'll be alternated as needed, you may have it one day, have it taken away once you've invited someone else, then passed along. I'm aware officers can remove members. \n\nIt's a mature club, it hasn't happened yet. But i will remove idiots regardless of age, if you have the officer tag at the time and abuse it, you and your entourage will be removed. \n\nMy golden rule is the most common rule of Australia, Dont be a D**k. Respect others, if your attitude is impacting someone and they have explained reasonably as to why they don't appreciate. Respect it and ease up on it. \n\nthat being said, don't be shy, drop a message, meet some new people that are similar to yourself! \n\nThere are no set requirements, Ranked, Norms, Arams etc. It's just a club room, you'll find people matching your preferences as it grows. \nYou'll find them as it grows, main thing everyone wants, is to find some like minded people to have fun with. And thats what we intend to provide.","replies":[{"poster":"Sparklesfly","date":"2016-07-02T07:55:41.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"May I please join your club?

Just as stated, were a non-toxic group that is understanding to real life, sometimes shit happens during a game you can't control, expect some understanding, also expect to be told bluntly what people think, i get annoyed sometimes by club members, i just say it and move on \"you're f**king annoying today leave me alone\" but i still appreciate and like all my members, you were just annoying in the moment :P and move on. \n\nMature people that don't get their ego's from a video game and can talk with a shred of intelligence and share theorycrafting ideas, progress ratings etc, get help advice without parroting mobafire etc","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-06-14T10:06:29.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Buhawi","date":"2016-06-12T14:10:55.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi can you guys add me , Buwahi my ign , from AUS yes :D \na young dad 26 :) looking for a club and some new peeps to play with thank you ^__^ {{champion:105}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-04-24T07:54:40.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Copy & Pasting and adding to a post i gave another thread into clubs, since this thread is getting some interest. I figured i'd post it here to show people where we're going with things.\n\nKjhin hit the nail on the head with all the points, my club is predominately for the 25+ crowd in OCE servers that are sick of toxic immature team mates and wish for an environment with like minded people.\n\nThat being said, ours is based round the fact we have responsibilities, careers, partners, young kids, pets etc, homes to maintain. Mine is more an area where we understand that and if life happens to interupt our fam. We don't e-kick them in the balls and flame. We understand, notch it up as a loss and move forward.\n\nBut mostly its for people who want a place to hang, without the childish trolling. To express ideas and thoughts without the fear of \"OMG THATS SO DUMB, ARE YOU NOOB? DO YOU NOT KNOW XYZ STRATS?\" It's a place to make mistakes, learn, grow, have a laugh, meet new people, perhaps create your own ranked team within.\n\nBut mostly its for people who understand we're playing a game, we enjoy a win, we also enjoy a loss, we don't get our ego's off the game. We play to relax and have fun, as we grow we'll have people from bronze-diamond etc. Some will want to focus on their ranked more and move on later, maybe to return some day once their personal goals are achieved. We wish them well on their journey and welcome them back when its done.\n\n> _**I have actually liked the idea of some of the others creating inclub comps etc with minor incentives, be it $10 to each player in the team that wins in RP or something. Just something to have fun with. Maybe i'll allow the club message to be the winning teams choice- a link to some victory song etc, something that makes them feel good and though mostly casual, will improve peoples skills without the stress of ranked play.**_\n\nWho knows, i've run major guilds before in other games. I've run large sucessful guilds in WoW with over 150+ active raiding members and moved onto PvP where i've created a 2.2k+ club for rated BG's and arena when alot of us quit raiding end of WotlK. Delegation is key, at present. It's feeling out for us, the direction where the bulk of people wish to go. I will act as a final decision maker, but i'll bend to the wishes of the clubs majority if its in good taste.\n\nWith us being mature and older, i don't see too many issues with internal whinging. I expect my members to be able to sort out their own issues without attacking personal character etc. Opinions are like buttholes, everyone has one. Everyone thinks theirs doesnt stink. That being said, if you have an opinion and want to share it, you must accept others also without jumping down throats.\n\nThats 25&UP in a nutshell at present.\n\nExtra Content for this thread: \n\nI've just added that when we reach 25-30members. We will be looking at in-club competitions, with minor incentives. Be it $50 in RP to the winning team ($10 each). Your team being allowed to set the chat message for a week, be it to gloat about their glorious victory over the club, a link to a video they've made and an amusing song, maybe even give the gift of Summoner Icons to indicate a who won what, when within. If players are interested, we may make cash pots. Perhaps $5 per player ($25 per team), winning team takes the lot etc. I'm in no way interested in personal financial / rp gain. I'd compete, but i'd be dipping into my own money to put towards this, i'm not rich i have bills to pay and responsibities to meet, it's something to flesh out how this will happen. But given that we're an older crew. I'm sure we can find ways to figure it out. \n\nI may look at making a quick forum for easier ideas to be posted, easier methods of communication for these ideas and ways to distribute awards etc. We're older, a pixel gold star isn't going to make us try harder. But can we have some fun with a perk on the side? Definitely! \n\nThat being said, we do not restrict to 25&UP, but if you are younger. You're expected to be respectful, be non-toxic and keep the childishness to a minimum, a couple of complaints is all it will take to remove you as the focus is.... 25&UP, but we welcome all players who can be mature and non-toxic. Keep their salt shaker in the kitchen, where it belongs.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
