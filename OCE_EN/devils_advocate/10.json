I'm not the player for your team, i'm not exactly willing to train a team on map awareness, strategy to the game, how to evolve your style and item builds to suit situations rather than \"this is the most OP\". You need to change as the game changes, if you can't you will be capitalized upon and be the reason we lose, i don't have that much patience to keep explaining what you're doing wrong over and over. I'm happy to instruct, there's alot of knowledge, im happy to lose to see constant improvements, but if you can't see your mistakes as you make them, admit them and try to learn from it. I'm really not the player for you.\n\nedit; please don't try to justify to me why Xin should be in jungle instead. Do the maths, on hit Xin Zhao jungle build is actually weaker. ","replies":[]}]}
