Let me clear a few things up for you. First, you must understand that while you won't see immediate results from reporting trolls and toxic players in your match, your report of other players violating the summoner's code goes a long way. The system doesn't blindly ban players based on number of reports, but each report flags a match for investigation. If there if behaviour worthy of action, then that action will be taken. \n\n> [Punishments generally follow a basic escalation path](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-)\n\n> First Offense: 10 Game Chat Restriction\nSecond Offense: 25 Game Chat Restriction\nThird Offense: Two Week Suspension\nFourth Offense: Permanent Suspension\n\nBear in mind if someone is trolling you, retaliating by trolling them back isn't an action you should take. If they're messing with you, they're simply trying to get a reaction out of you. Anything you say or do against them will only fuel the fire and further ruin the game experience of you and  everyone else in the match. Your best bet is to mute the troll and report them at the end of the game. \n\nCorehog has addressed the issue around your loot restriction, and simply put avoiding the behaviour that got you chat restricted in the first place is the best approach to getting your loot eligibility back. It seems you're a little unsure of what you said that was punishment worthy, and if you'd like, the community here can help you with that if you were to post your reform card or chat logs here. It's a bit late now, but you can always appeal punishments by [opening a ticket with Player Support.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)\n\nRemember that Hextech crafting is a reward for good behaviour and I encourage you to remember that in your future matches when you decide to use chat. I believe that this warning will give you the opportunity to improve your mindset on the fields of justice and to not let the trolls get to you. [Always aim to have behaviour worthy of a Champion](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751874-Behavior-Worthy-of-a-Champion)\n\nI hope this helped clarify some of your questions.

Riot says im not, community says in general i am... Gets green icon...\n\nb) i wasn't trolling, i still played it out, i just refused to die non-stop for them considering they were going to die anyways, Trundle can only do so much for 4 ranged AD champs (well 1 teemo in there), i spoke my mind clearly. Albeit frustrated, i still don't apologize for my words. And i won't. I'm in no way sorry, i'm sorry that the automatic system can be abused in this way however. As i stated, makes me just want to make a new account when im in a bad mood to just politely goad people into offensive actions that can be reportable and do it. That's what the current system encourages more than responsible use.... Ever been in a game where someone doesn't really say \"report for toxic, feeding, unskilled (i mean lol, reporting for unskilled...)\" hasn't really occurred when you solo Que?\n\nc) my history of positive re-enforcement counts for nothing when someone reports you, it has no \"automatic detection\" on how i positively helped a team mate, stopped toxic chat within my team, refused to join in the \"this person sucks, lets toxic bash him and report him after\" simply because he was newer to the game or new to the champ. Yet a few reports can do this to a player. Nice work, see comment A also.\n\nd) So far all threads i've looked at around \"Loot restrictions\" the common consensus is \"it's not really relevant it's more like 90days than showing good behavior\" because once again, how can the automatic system detect positive chat, other than getting honored after games / not reported. Which means, once again... I look back at comment A... Why does the automatic system reward me as an honorable member, team work surprisingly. Yet loot restrict me, when its obvious i am more team orientated and focused, driven and even my match history and several logs will say over and over \"I dont mind dying as long as the team uses it well and wins the trade in the end, team game\" etc etc.\n\ne) there is no way for a player to check how their reform process is going, this is just demotivating and as good as just stopping playing for the short term... Which doesn't help your reform because you haven't played. Thus alot of people just stay logged off, or in my case... I'll be polite, i just do bare minimum to play the automatic system also and not get reported and make games as short as possible so i may use the automatic system against itself.\n\nThat's just because i've got half a brain and realize that the system in place doesn't actually promote positive play, it rewards systematic play within its rules. Like the champion mastery system. Easily abused when you play champs in unorthodox positions and do \"ok' yet some 30-9-10 assassin with 200+ cs at the end game, still only gets A+ when in mid compared to a support assassin that did 6-5-15 and 60cs at the end, but still gets an S- for a level 6 token, then to cheese it, go jg them for your S since its got a small bell curve of players. \n\nI'm giving examples now of systematic abuse and riot doesn't do much to stop it.\n\nChat restrictions are over, in fact it was good not to type, i literally made my chatbox disappear and didnt read a single thing from anyone for 10games. Was pretty nice for once. \n\nBut loot restrictions? I've already done around 30-40 games with loads of honors within them... Still restricted. Do i actually have to lodge a support ticket to get this removed? Cause so far, other threads on the subject all revolve around 90days from the time of restrictions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-06-28T03:02:27.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seriously, some riot staff go look at the log of the game and tell me i'm wrong, honestly. \n\nDon't try and say \"but you still used bad language and abused people\" crap, sometimes people annoy the fu*k out of you and they receive NO punishment what so ever because my report vs 4 team mates who are jerking each vother off, doesn't weigh up.","replies":[{"poster":"Jayhawk","date":"2016-06-28T06:50:57.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You were given an answer to this in a different thread, but I'll reiterate it to you. The system isn't designed to allow 4 man stacks to just mass report someone falsely and have it be counted more, it counts it as a flagged game for review but not as four separate reports so that argument is invalid because your report was just as valid as theirs was, you just may have a history of toxicity which triggered the punishment. There is a mute button if they annoy you that much in chat, if you don't feel like using it, don't use chat unless you have to communicate something you feel you can't use pings for and just try to ignore what they write.\n\nAlso, if you're so concerned about people not receiving punishments, I noticed in another thread you thought that reporting either took too long or was pointless, as Deep Sea Nami told you, you only know someone got punished if your report was the last report that triggered their punishment. Also, if you don't report people, how do you expect the system to catch every incident that occurs considering the number of players and games played. The report system is there as a flagging system, if you won't use it, don't expect that you'll see punishments coming through.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-06-28T03:21:33.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"who cares, its already happening and nothing gets done about it, may as well make it so bad nobody wants to play till riot is forced to do something","replies":[]},{"poster":"Corehog","date":"2016-06-28T01:48:23.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taken from [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209939463-Hextech-Crafting-Restrictions)\n\n>REFORM PERIOD\nOnce your punishment ends, you'll enter a reform period, during which you'll remain ineligible to earn Hextech Chests and Keys.
