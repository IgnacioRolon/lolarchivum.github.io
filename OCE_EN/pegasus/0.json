Then you get one every 10 levels.\n\nThis way you avoid people wasting their refunds on a 450ip champion they don't play anymore, and keep them for their actual use - taking back mistakes.\nOnce you get that problem solved, there's no need to ask for more refunds.\n\nps. Unpopular opinion, i know. Might be downvoted. It's fine, i understand.\nJust one note before that: Try and remember what you refunded, the reason you did it and why do you need more refunds.\nOnce you did that, think about my post again.","replies":[{"poster":"DrMattie","date":"2015-05-24T08:30:26.180+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My biggest mistake was refunding Jax because I was level 10 and I had no fucking clue how to play him, (I bought him with IP).

Fact is Riot didn't even need to offer refunds at all but they did. Really refunds are a way for Riot to avoid people complaining about \"accidental\" purchases. If you've gone and wasted refunds it's your own fault.
