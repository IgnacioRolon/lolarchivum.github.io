If it was, it would be so easy to manipulate and abuse the system. \n\nInstead, they are based on your MMR, which is losely based off your wins/losses.\n\nYour MMR  is what is used to determine a comfortable level of skill for you to play at. It will match you with players of similar MMR (even though you will see a range of ranks in your games, they will likely still have similar MMR). \n\n*as a general rule*\n\n* You win games, you get MMR. \n* You lose games, you lose MMR.\n* Remake games, no change in MMR. \n\n\nSince you have a pretty bad win rate at the moment, the systems senses that you are struggling and that you perhaps are not able to play at the level where you currently are. As a result, you will be losing more LP and gaining less till the system recognizes that you are in a good spot for your skill level right now. Your LP gains/losses will probably return to \"normal\" once your winrate hits ~50%. \n\nNote: Please don't use 3rd party sites to see what your MMR is. Since Riot are the only ones that actually know how it is calculated, only they will know your actual MMR. 3rd party sites like OP.GG take a guess at the algorithm, but for all we know they could be way off.","replies":[]}]}
