At about 5 minutes in, I was told that the client had disconnected due to having no internet access. This, however, was not the case - I had full internet access. I decided it wasn't very major and that I would take the loss as my support afk'd after my disconnection. I reconnected at the 10 minute mark and played the game right through until our nexus was destroyed. At the end of the game I was slapped with five 20 minute queue bans for afking, I must stress that this was a FIVE minute client failure. How is this fair?","replies":[{"poster":"TheEvenOdderOne","date":"2017-01-12T02:05:15.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is bullshit i got the low priority queue EVEN THO I REJOINED THE GAME WTF RITO FIX YOUR GOD DAMN PUNISHMENT SYSTEM","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-12T11:08:11.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not-so-fun Fact: The threshold for taking no action in which someone is considered to be \"afk\" is five minutes.
