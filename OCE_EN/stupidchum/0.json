Our usual ping is around 90-108 but something has caused this to happen which I believe is a hardware malfunction at the riot headquarter? All of us lives in different regions of Singapore using different network providers, hence it is definitely not our computer or network problem. Riot please fix this since none of us can play right now even though it is our School Break  {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} Rito Please check on the System? Thanks alot!","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2017-09-05T07:02:28.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey\n\nThe most likely reason for this is the recent cable cut on the SEA-ME-WE3 cable, which connects Singapore with Perth.   When it gets cut (happens from time to time), that traffic then has to find another route.  Usually via the USA, which increases latency dramatically.\n\nThe bad news is that current ETA for a fix is mid October at the earliest, since they have to [send a ship out there, find the break, pull it up off the ocean floor and then re-join it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qTk5WNq9E).   The good news is that more cables are being built to service that route, but they aren't ready yet.\n\nYou can read more about the cut and ISPs involved here - https://www.itnews.com.au/news/aussie-internet-pain-after-asian-subsea-cables-cut-472070\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"My Blue Buff","date":"2017-09-10T01:36:47.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply Mindstar, I was so confused as to what happened to my ping after I came back from travelling. \nCheers for the update!","replies":[]}]}]}
