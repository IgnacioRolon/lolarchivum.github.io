When I tried to reconnect I got the error &quot;unable to connect to the server.&quot; I then tried to restart my computer, router and the league client, all didn&#039;t fix the issue. According to OP.GG the game is still ongoing, over an hour later, which seems quite unlikely considering it is supposedly a 4v5. Any help is appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-05-08T02:01:35.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nSounds like you're experiencing what is known as a Ghost Game, these are caused when the client/server doesn't receive the proper \"End Game\" message.\n\nThese aren't something you can fix yourself, nor can Riot. You just have to wait it out, the issue will resolve itself within a couple hours.","replies":[]}]}
