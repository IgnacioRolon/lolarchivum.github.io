And, trust me, I know that I'm not diamond worthy, or anything like that. I try my best each game to not rage/ feed. Although every once in a while I will flame, and will go 0/6. I was just wondering if anyone had some advice about how I can prevent my teammates (and myself) from feeding the enemy to the point where they're just unkillable. Now, I understand that I can roam and all that, but like, is there anything else I can do? Because I'm not always in the position to help my teammates all game. I understand that I sound like one of those people who believes they are diamond worthy, but honestly, I just want some advice from someone who has gone through this and can help me get out of bronze.. \r\n\r\nI was also wondering what the best champions/ roles are to carry yourself out of bronze? How can I perfect these roles/ champions? I've heard that SkillCapped is good (mainly from protatomonster) but honestly, I cannot afford to go paying money for something that will 'supposedly' make me better. Is there maybe a free sight that is essentially the same thing? Should I be watching pro streamers? LCS? I don't know, and that's why I was hoping to get some help from my fellow players. \r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Shyvana Bot","date":"2015-02-21T04:58:28.000+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello fellow bronze! I lost my 10 placement matches and was placed in Bronze V, 3 days later I'm in bronze III on a hot streak all the way from V-III and i shall share with you my secrets. \n\nDon't play ranked, not just yet, you need to go on a training trip.\n\nBuy any decent jungler, even if you don't intend to jungle, i recommend Vi or J4. go to mobafire.com and read a guide then play 5 bot games with your chosen jungler. Then play 5 more normal games with said jungler. At the end of this you should have learned a couple of new things, firstly you now know how to jungle (yay, just incase). secondly you know what kind of lane behaviour inhibit a good gank: lakers pushing their lane, wasting all their mana, not warding, not telling you if the enemy has warded etc. Thirdly you will also learn when a lane is an easy gank, so that when you are laning you develop a spidey sense. You might be over extended and then think to yourself ' If i was a jungler i would totally gank me right now'.\n\nPick the next role, this time i recommend adc. pick an adc with 0 escapes such as jinx. This will teach you proper positioning. you need learn that as an adc you need to stay at the back lines. Get rid of that bronze ego, that little voice in your head saying 'Go in, go in, do it , do it, be a hero, get a penta, you are op'. Why not pick a adc with escapes like ezreal you might ask? because thats a crutch, you learn nothing, you end up relying on his escape every time you goof up. Again play 5 bot game and 5 normal games.\n\nBy this point you should be familiar with jungling and adc, two important roles for carrying in bronze. 'But what if i don't get them?' you might ask. Now you pick as support. In bronze from my experience don't pick any squishy support. No janna or sona or soraka, this is because your teammates will always leave you, they cannot commit to a fight. I suggest two types of support: the AP carry support and the Initiator tank. That AP carry include stuff like Annie, morgana and orianna. They all have ultimates and abilities that can change direction of a team fight and carry if need be. Tank supports include leona and thresh that can initiate a fight. Remember in bronze, ' a team of sheep led by a lion will always defeat a team of lions led by a sheep', the first to initiate generally wins.\n\nAnother advantage of AP supports is that they can be played in midlane as well pretty easily in bronze, two birds with one stone. Finally you have the top lane, I suggest sustain champions such as irelia and garen or long range mage tanks like lissandra. The same thing here 5 bots games and 5 normal games. \n\nSome final tips as well, don't be greedy if the enemy is running away with 1 hp to an un-warded part of the map just leave him. His entire team might be there waiting for you. And never risk getting half your health blown off in lane just to get that one minion kill. Last but not least in bronze never rage or flame at your teammates, we all make mistakes, you need to lead them to victory buy coordinating with them and being kind. No one wants to listen to a rage yell orders at them.\n\n Last Notes, No game is un-throwable always end it if you have the opportunity.\n\nEdit: i forgot to mention, update your trinket at level 9! its free, its so easy to forget ( i always forget) but I've been trying to get rid of that bad habit, It is such a strong upgrade. And don't just rely on it for wards, always buy normal wards and pinks if they have stealth champions.","replies":[{"poster":"aîdan","date":"2015-02-21T09:34:41.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Felsummoner,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=lUXEbXkK,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-02-21T04:58:28.000+0000)\n>\n> Hello fellow bronze!

I'd advise watching NA or EU as they play at a much higher level than our own OCE scrubs. After that just find champions you enjoy rather than champions that have high win rates on LoLking. Then play them a lot, you'll get your mechanics and predictions right more often if you consistantly play fun picks rather than FotM. After that your CS is a huge deal, in lower levels most of the people I see can only kill one or two minions per wave. You want to be getting every one. To put it into perspective 3 full waves is worth about 50 gold more than one kill. Get double your opponents cs by 5-6 minutes and you may as well have gotten first blood for the gold discrepancy (unless of course it's 1:2)","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-02-21T09:00:29.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Help out your team, not just yourself.\n\nWhen you can roam, roam.\n\nPlay safe, think & especially, don't rage.","replies":[{"poster":"aîdan","date":"2015-02-21T09:35:04.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JustTrash,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=lUXEbXkK,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-02-21T09:00:29.360+0000)\n>\n> Help out your team, not just yourself.\n> \n> When you can roam, roam.\n> \n> Play safe, think & especially, don't rage.\n\nAwesome, I'll keep this in mind!","replies":[]}]}]}
