It was all going fine until I started to experience some lag, except it was a little unusual.  I would be unable to move, type, buy items etc. Yet I could still see all the other players moving around. The infamous \"Attempting to Reconnect\" sign would pop up for 5-15 seconds and then it would all be fine again. \r\n\r\nAfter this happened for a while it would eventually not be able to reconnect again and after exiting the client I would not be able to open it again, for 30-60 minutes. This resulted in me losing two games (ranked), getting demoted and now I have been put in a lower priority queue. This is the second time I have been put into a lower priority queue due to lag. Trust me, I am not one to ragequit, I'm one of those 'Never Surrender' people that everyone hates. \r\n\r\nAnyways, I was just wondering if anyone else had experienced this and perhaps anyone knows what was going on. Both games I would of easily won, so it's extremely frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-21T08:19:10.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That could mean you're having upload issues.\n\nHave you tried [changing DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq4)?\n\nI feel so copy-paste mentioning that to everyone, but that's what seems to solve almost every issue.\n\nIf that doesn't work, could you please tell me your OS and ISP?\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}
