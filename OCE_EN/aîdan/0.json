It saddens me that a man like that who singlehandedly savaged our country's reputation and prevented all future fun references in movies about us from occurring again is running our country...\n\n2.\nThere has been a lot of noise from fanatical feminists that there hasn't been very many Star Wars toys featuring Rey who is one of the main characters in the new Star Wars film, they say how unfair and sexist it is that Darth Vader who isn't even in the film (and is male) gets hundreds and hundreds of toy versions, while Rey (who is female) gets far far fewer. So much noise was created from this small group of feminists that Monopoly publicly apologised and promised to re-release all their Star Wars themed monopoly sets with her as a playable piece.\n\n\nPeople get so caught up in their own little world where everything is against them that they lose sight of the fact that it doesn't actually matter. \n\n1.\nIt was a 'supposed to be fun' reference in a kids movie that never explicitly mentioned it was 'New Zealand' or 'Middle Earth' that they were referring to anyway.\nNot worthy of making 2 (now famous) hollywood directors publicly apologise to a country as well as trying to extort millions from the film company on top of showing the world that NZ cant take a joke.\n\n2. (minor star wars spoilers)\nRey is like most main characters, the boring old story recycled again and again: rags to riches, big fish trapped in a small pond, thinks they cant do anything meaningful but has a hidden power they don't know of, etc etc. (unlike Vader who paved the way for his character type at the time) Rey's looks are nothing special, she wears drab coloured sand clothing for the entirety of the film (looking no different to the torrent of sand coloured characters in the previous films), unlike Leia with her stereotypical hair and attitude Rey has no distinguishing features whatsoever, (unlike Vader who has the most memorable face in the history of sci-fi (if not every genre) films) her makeup makes her look plain and uninteresting, her voice is just ordinary (unlike Vader) apart from one fight scene she doesn't really do much in the scheme of things (and that fight was no different to most other fights in the series) (where as Vader was the whole reason of the first 6 films)\nso of course its not a personal attack on the equality women by not making any toys of her.\nof course the toy companies are going to make more Darth Vader toys than Rey toys, because more people want Darth Vader than Rey and so they will make more money by using their factories to produce his likeness instead of hers.\nit has nothing at all to do with gender equality.\npeople cant see that bigger picture and instead focus on it being a personal attack on them.\n\nMy point is (shown by the ridiculousness of my examples) that we are missing the bigger picture here, in the very recent history we chained up and shipped over people who didn't share our skin tone (in ships that packed them together like sardines unable to move around while disease killed between 15 and 30% of them) to an alien country and whipped them raw while they did all our jobs for us, and now only a few decades later we are berating people for typing 4 letters on a recreational computer game? (the first 2 of which you are expected to say at the end of a game anyway)\nlets look at the bigger picture here, its a computer game, not government, and there are always going to be dickheads in the world no mater what you do, and a few insecure adolescents rubbing proverbial salt in the proverbial wounds after beating you in a computer simulated game that you wont even remember them doing in 10 minutes time is the least of our worries.\n\ni am by no means defending what they do, i think you're right its unbecoming and shows they are a bad winner (or loser) and isn't fair to the people who worked hard trying to keep their team in the game.\n\nits true that the community gets to decide what is and isn't okay in the game, but because of our cushioned 1st world lifestyle, we have nothing real to complain about, and humans naturally want to complain about something (hell me writing this pointless post is proof of that) and because we have nothing major to complain about we do exactly what Winston Peters and the Feminist Zelots do and latch onto the tiny little problems in life and blow them out of proportion, we have lost the ability to see things in perspective, i can guarantee you that if we all worked 12 hours a day in the coal mines every day, no one would be complaining that there are too many Darth Vader toys on the shelves or that the kid halfway around the world wasn't secure enough in himself to say GG at the end of a game.\n\nin reality It is no different to our rapidly deteriorating immune systems, if we take away all the major diseases that our bodies are supposed to fight they have nothing left to do except attack themselves. (which is what allergies are, and what these hospital superbugs do) \nand just like that isn't good for our bodies health, babying everyone to the point of not being able to type 4 letters at the end of a game is not good for peoples social health, or the social state of our society.\n\nAnyway isn't Lol an american game and isn't 'freedom of speech' what the states are supposed to be all about? \n\nanyway i must apologise to you, you by chance seem to have gotten wayyy too many long posts from me xD \n(i just like to be thorough in my posts) \n(and this is what happens when I'm really bored and my internet is too unreliable to actually play the game)\nbut i swear you are probably my favourite rioter!! so its not personal, and i wont post any more long posts about this topic xD","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-01-11T03:48:31.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries man, always happy to chat about whatever.\n\n>  now only a few decades later we are berating people for typing 4 letters on a recreational computer game?\n\nWe aren't berating them at all, It's more like \"thats not cool man, you should stop that\". \n\nI don't think people are losing sight of the bigger picture, our players are taking a strong stance against verbal abuse and racism etc.\n\nHowever that doesn't mean they can't ask for sportsmanlike games as well.

The same way James Bond doesn't go all red faced and run kicking and screaming at people because that scenario doesn't fit within the expected 'aura' that he is supped to adhere to.\n\nWhy you do get it in Lol (and other E sports) is \n\n1.  when in an immobile (often hunched over) state for a long time a kink in your neck blocks nerves and blood flow to the brain causing headaches which means the brain doesn't function as well and also leads to uncomfortableness and irritability. (which makes them more likely to put people down.)\n2.  its no secret that lol can be extremely frustrating at times (even if youre winning) which again leads to irritability.\n3.  (not saying everyone is like this) but because all you need to do is sit in a chair, it attracts the other kind of people, those who cant be fucked playing sports, don't have the patience for chess and other similar activities, also the younger demographic that are less mature and don't really understand how the sublties of good conduct. the lazier group also is more likely to pick up a mouse than a basket ball, and because they don't exercise are more prone to depression and their bodies hold more unspent tension than those who play sports.\n\nobviously there are exceptions to all 3 sports, but because lol (unlike basketball) mashes you up with 10 different random people every game, statistically you get to see a lot more variety of people.\n\nand lol isn't the only one, there is far more rage and snobbery in FPS games, I'm pretty sure tea-bagging in CoD would be just as bad as 'GGEZ' is in lol.\n\nof course there are positives too, lol has much more variety in gameplay than BBall and chess, and to a lot of people is probably much more fun. You also have far fewer cheaters in lol (especially at a professional level) its hard to take steroids that improve your Syndra playing. and unless you're a CIA hacker, manipulating the code is out of the question. As a spectator sport its hard to beat, id rather watch lasers cutting down a katarina that tried and failed to flash away, than some guy dribbling a ball down the court in the same way he does every other game. \n\nBut despite all that, there is no excuse for bad conduct in Lol, no matter how irritable you are, its a conscious decision to put down a fellow player and that can never be justified, but it also shouldn't be blown too far out of proportion IMO.\n\ni personally have never reported anyone, i like to be as positive as possible in games and i detest those who purposely insult and degrade others, and will (unless i see it will only provoke the situation) try to defend the receiver of the insult.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-01-11T05:16:25.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> i personally have never reported anyone, i like to be as positive as possible in games and i detest those who purposely insult and degrade others, and will (unless i see it will only provoke the situation) try to defend the receiver of the insult.\n\nThat's really awesome that you do stand up and defend other players.

It's definitely true that a lot of negativity in our game is due to players having a bad day (sometimes even multiple players having a bad day in the same game!).\n\nOur system is designed to take into account the games you are reported in vs the games you arent reported in (i.e. kinda like on average how often do you get reported per 100 games.). So if you are only mildly negative and you are reported you aren't going to get punished if its like 1 in 100 games.
