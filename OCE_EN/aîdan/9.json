Just a quick note, I&#039;m not on a losing streak and my win streak for the past 20 games is above 50%. \r\n\r\nAnyways, so I&#039;ve been gaining only like 16 lp lately instead of my usual 22 - 25, and it even got as bad as **_8_** in my past game. Now, I know that you&#039;ll most likely be thinking it&#039;s because my mmr is so much lower than my division, however, when I&#039;ve been losing I&#039;ve onl y lost 15 oor 16 lp in the past couple of games? \r\n\r\nReally confused, would like a rioters input on this.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Hairy Lobster","date":"2015-11-04T09:37:07.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had the same issue, 8 LP from last game's victory. I think it has something to do with Riot activating Loss Forgiven for the teams who have disconnecting players pending this connection issue.\n It's a pain in the {{champion:22}}. Not worth playing ranked atm as i'm bound to lose more LP than I gain with LP offset enabled.","replies":[{"poster":"aîdan","date":"2015-11-04T09:47:50.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed. Wanted to grind games for Gold, but if I'm getting 8 lp per win and 16 or so per loss, don't know if it'll be worth the hassle...","replies":[]}]}]}
