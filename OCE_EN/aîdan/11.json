I think it could be a cool add on and wanted to hear what everyone thinks. \r\n\r\nSo, please, &#039;buff&#039; this post if you agree, and, &#039;nerf&#039; it if you disagree!","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-07-23T12:55:50.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"go away, you cant buff text","replies":[]}]}
