If so, please let me know.\n\n Idea one:\n\nName: ?\n\nPlayers Per Team: 5\n\nMap: Twisted Treeline/ Summoners Rift\n\nSo, in this game mode you get to chose your own champion. I know, it sounds a little farfetched, but hear me out.  So, you're able to combine champions abilities to make your own, unique champion. For example, you might have Karthus's passive, Ziggs's Q, Ahri's W, Vi's e, and Sydra's ultimate. It's pretty simple when put like that. There are two flaws I see in this game mode are, the new champions look and the fact that certain abilities (such as Gnar's ultimate) require special synergy with other abilities in their kit (like Gnar's ultimate and his passive). With the first flaw, I did have the idea of combining all champions used, but I'm sure that wouldn't appeal to anyone except maybe Urgot... But that's besides the point. With flaw two, the only solution I see is to make the abilities like Gnar's ultimate unavailable. So that's all for that game mode, will definitely appreciate  some suggestions on how it could be improved, but other than that, that's pretty much it, thanks for reading, sorry for my grammar, and remember, I would love to hear your opinion on how it could be improved or if it's just not doable.

The fact that players are able to make there own unique champion which could be over powered or completely suck, it's not competitive, like ranked, but to have fun. But, in saying that, if that is a big problem, you could perhaps  make it so that you can only use one ability from each champion? Therefor stopping the all Leona cc kit. Perhaps they could also limit your new kit to one source of cc, obviously making it more balanced. Also, with your other statement, like the cc, they could limit your kit to only one steroid? I don't know, I personally believe that drains the fun out of it, but let me know what you think.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-02-01T19:01:29.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when an adc has 4 steroids?","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-02-01T19:02:22.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when urgot has 4 abilities that do something?  broken","replies":[]}]}]}]}
