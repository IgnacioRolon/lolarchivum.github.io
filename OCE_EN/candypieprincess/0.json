I didn't really expect anyone to notice it but thank you soooo much for all the wonderful comments!!!\n\nSleeves are made out of a tougher material, so they stay up. (imagine holding up a piece of cardboard).\n\nMy photographer ended up taking a couple of shots- some with our own version of 'Ahri Skins'.\n\nI'm looking for recommendations on who I should cosplay next actually! I've done Asuna and Kill la Kill.\n\nHoping to do more league cosplays. Any suggestions? :)","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-04-05T07:18:05.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a challenge for you, A FUNCTIONING URGOT.
