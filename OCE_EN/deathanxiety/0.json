I thought I'd post in here to see if i could try and get it reversed but i was just scammed by another League player. \n\nWe added each other after a game and sort of because online friends, playing games together. I have done this quite a few times before with other people with no dramas, most league players are honest people. \n\nHe asked if we could trade mystery gifts with one another, he asked for a champion and said he would trade either a champion gift or skin gift which ever one i had wanted. I had done this before with new players i had played with online with absolutely no troubles. You obviously had to wait 2 weeks of being a friend on league to trade gifts but when he asked today and i did, he deleted and possibly blocked me from league right after. \n\nI was just wondering i could get the gift reversed or at the very least taken off him. His name was EatSomeTimTam.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-19T10:26:45.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You got scammed. And it's entirely your fault.
