Going into senior school this year, I stopped playing for 6 months and dedicated to school. I did extremely well especially in physics, chemistry & mathematics, and now that I have started playing again I&#039;m scared that maybe the stress from some games (admit it, up to half of the games you play you go through some stress because of annoying people!) might affect my school success. What are your thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-09-19T02:45:13.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's just what happens.

If you have trolls or whatever in your game simply ignore them and focus on your own playing. I never get stressed over a league game no matter what happens in it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-09-16T08:39:39.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends on how you balance playing with the rest of your life. If you spend all your free time playing then it's unlikely, at best, it wont affect how you do in other aspects of your life whereas playing, for example, 1 hour a day max would allow the rest of your life to be effectively unaffected. Obviously how much time you could spend playing without it negatively affecting your life differs from person to person, just make sure you don't play too much and you should be fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"2 Girls 1 Gragas","date":"2015-09-16T07:53:52.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Infected Walnut","date":"2015-09-16T05:42:45.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't get stressed from this game.\nand it only affects you if you let it. there's nothing wrong with playing a game or two when you get home from school, but spending all your spare time playing it will definitely affect your grades","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-09-16T05:09:54.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, used to be a straight A student and then I started playing league and now I am more like a straight B student.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Soulhavok","date":"2015-09-16T05:09:48.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha yeah i wouldn't be playing this game if I was still in school.
