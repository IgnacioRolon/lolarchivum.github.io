Getting a new connection from when you had another one *could* cause conflicts with your configuration. Does everything else which connects to the internet on your computer work fine? Have you reset your internet settings yet?","replies":[{"poster":"Giacomo","date":"2015-01-30T05:50:40.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much every thing was fine until I had to launch league to install the actual game.

Same issue.\nIt HAS to do with resetting my computer imo. but I dont know what i did because this is my sisters laptop handed down to me. maybe she unintentionally did something that would of solved this problem. I dunno I asked her and she doesnt remember.\n\nAnyhow im not certain its a connectivity issue, everyone seems to be fine with the internet and other downloaded stuff works fine.

If you have, next step would be to check over the steps in the [Reinstalling League of Legends](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends) section.  Ideally when you try and install it again, your PC should be 100% clear of League of Legends files - including the original install folder.\n\nLet me know how that goes.  If you continue to run into problems after that, I'd suggest opening a support ticket, and the Player Support team will be able to help you work out the issue in a more one-on-one fashion.\n\n-Mindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Giacomo","date":"2015-01-29T03:44:15.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for looking into my issue, I followed the steps on Reinstalling League of Legends like making sure PC is 100% clear of League of Legends files and stuff like that, even downloaded CCleaner, but nothing seems to be working. \n\nAt the moment I have received a response to my ticket (Faster than expected, nice) but the steps they gave me haven't worked, I sent them my DxDiag stuff and i'm awaiting my response.\n\nIf it's worth mentioning, these problems occurred after I reset my computer, I seemed to be able to download league before with no problems.","replies":[]}]}]}
