And he gets away with doing it because his stupid passive blocks turret shots so he's melting me down under my own turret and he's staying at full health. He's the ONLY champion that I face toplane that I've never had a good experience against in lane. Only ONCE have I actually beaten a panth in lane playing fiora ONLY because the player wasn't very good and kept constantly making mistakes and even then I BARELY got away without dying.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2017-12-23T03:31:16.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ this","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-22T03:59:23.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Zaptar\n\n*cough*","replies":[{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2017-12-22T04:01:04.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"yeah nah, im better","replies":[]}]}]}
