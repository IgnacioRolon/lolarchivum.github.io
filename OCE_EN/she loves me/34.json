Im not even sure its a bug to be honest, i have never seen anyone use a shield during zhonyas. And there is no point in even using seraphs during zhonyas. The shield lasts 3 seconds, zhonyas lasts 2.5, you will be getting 0.5 seconds of effective use out of the shield, which you may as well use either after or before using zhonyas.","replies":[]}]}
