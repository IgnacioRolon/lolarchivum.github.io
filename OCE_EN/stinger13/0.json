For instance back in the time when Black Cleaver&#039;s Cleaving effect was not unique, quite a few bruiser champs could just have four of these and nothing gonna stop them. I know how ridiculous this situation may sounds like but I&#039;m sure there&#039;s way to balance this. Maybe everyone entering the mode can only choose one item for the entire game and nothing else as soon as the game starts, maybe even before it starts so nobody can counter other players. Also the effect of Black Cleaver&#039;s effect is going to be pretty OP but things like Thornmail can easily counter it. It would be fantastic to see Riot try to bring this into the game because this mode is not about balance but all about FUN!","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-10-04T03:13:01.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Talks about \"URF-like mode\", refers to balance...\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Stinger13","date":"2016-10-04T07:57:56.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I thought it wasn't an appropriate description there...","replies":[]}]}]}
