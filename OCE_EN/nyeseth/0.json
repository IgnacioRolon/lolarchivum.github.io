Now, obviously, this couldn&#039;t be on all of their abilities, I was thinking more of an ultimate ability that did more damage based on the percentage of missing mana at the time of casting. Obviously this is just a very rough Idea, but I thought that it would be interesting (even if only to discuss it).\r\n\r\nSo... What do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"awsumlad","date":"2016-05-17T02:41:46.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unsure if you are talking about the opponents mana or your champs mana, but I think you meant your champ so;\n\nIf it is an ADC that deals more damage based on missing mana it could be very OP since they are AA reliant and without mana they don't really suffer but would get more damage for free.\n\n The only way it could work would be terrible scaling on their autos so they are forced to cast spells then have scaling dmg on autos based on their missing mana. \n\nI didn't have much time to write this so it is a bit rushed and I only talked about an ADC but I suppose the main reason would be WHY?\nWhat thematics/background/story would a champ have that makes you think, 'yeah that champ should deal more dmg the less mana they have?'","replies":[{"poster":"Nyeseth","date":"2016-05-18T07:11:41.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I meant on the hypothetical champion themselves. \n\nNot an auto attack modifier, that would be a little absurd, especially if it was an ADC.

Also why would you want to punish mana based champions for using mana when the trade off for having mana is limited sustain?\n\nI mean we have champions like {{champion:13}}  {{champion:34}}  {{champion:50}}  who stack mana but also struggle a bit because they are limited by mana costs especailyl early on. \n\nThen we have {{champion:238}}  {{champion:64}}  {{champion:86}}  {{champion:55}}  who sustain throughout because they have no mana costs, and energy recovers so much faster than mana.
