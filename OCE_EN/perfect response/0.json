My boyfriend and I decided to play a game. A normal game. I don't play ranked, I only play for fun.I play normals so I won't be berated for my lack of diamond skill. I usually play support{{champion:37}} , today I played teemo{{champion:17}}  and my boyfriend was thresh{{champion:412}} . Thought it'd be fun. The lane was tough for sure, against a zil{{champion:26}}  and a tristana{{champion:18}} . I did ok, I didn't really feed them at all but we struggled getting bombed as I went in for any farm. The game was ok until our Fiora{{champion:114}}  became toxic. I wasn't even that bad as far as I could tell.  You miss a 'teamfight' where 3 of your team go in to fight while you're just trying to score a few more creepkills cause you have no gold from laning phase and suddenly you are the worst player in the entire existence of LoL.\r\n\r\nI was called the worst teemo ever. I was called cancer. I was even called a c**t. Over and over and over.  I get discouraged sometimes... but never like this. Theres something missing from league community now. I have been playing for a few years and the toxicity levels in lol were reduced with the introduction of tribunal and little ribbons. Something between then and now has changed. I've considered leaving but I love the game.\r\n\r\nWhat happened, summoners? Why can't I play something I don't usually play without getting abused?..IN NORMALS?","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2014-12-29T08:23:37.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"because you didn't have the common sense to mute them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-29T07:13:39.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because you played Teemo.
