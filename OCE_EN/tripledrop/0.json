Match making, unfortunately, is not always fair. One can only hope you win more then you lose to gain 20 LP and lose 15 LP. Sadly if you get into a bit of elo hell it can be extremely hard to climb out of when the match making isn't balanced.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-08-05T06:48:57.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> When playing ranked, don&#x27;t compare other&#x27;s ranks as it will only get you down. **Everyone has hidden matchmaking rating, and that is what matchmaking is based off**.

Sometimes in you're favor and sometimes not? Not to mention when you mention when you manage to pull off the upset that you weren't expected to win? What about in the cases of the less 50/50 chance? \nI cannot solo q to save my life. If I don't duo or trio a game then I don't get results. It's that simple and off that point how many are experiencing that same issue? Furthermore if this is the standard being set by Riot Oce to grow and development the next generation or future generations of league players then it's going to be a long unsuccessful road to get to the top. Solo q is broken and all I've seen is the last couple of weeks is negativity around this issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bunny","date":"2016-08-05T01:42:40.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with matchmaking is that it will pair people together expecting one person to carry. Example games where you have 4 members are on your team ranked silver 3-gold 5 and then have 1 person gold 2. The enemy team will have a similar match up but in most cases their gold 2 will be the mid and our gold 2 will be the support. What's the point in having a rank if it is not to represent your MMR so why shouldn't people go off peoples ranks. In my experience the gold 1 mid will outplay the silver 4 mid unless they have paid for a boost.","replies":[{"poster":"TripleDrop","date":"2016-08-05T06:28:00.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"exactly!\ni dont mind playing against players higher than me \nBUT \nat least give me team mates  similar rank also \nnot a fucking bronze 3 against a gold 5 in the top lane \nthat is just being destined to lose from the moment i logged in and queued","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-08-05T06:25:31.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and so are you","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bunny","date":"2016-08-04T22:01:05.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's only a normal isn't it.
