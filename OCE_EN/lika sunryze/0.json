Her harassment is really strong in lane, along with nice kiting with W and E. The ult can really wash away teamfights.

He has a poison that stacks, a slow, a steroid plus invisibility, some extra damage based on poison stacks and his ultimate which can take out entire teams at once with its ability to pierce through multiple enemies, great in tight spots in the jungle. As Twitch you can go to lane and if only the enemy ADC or only the enemy support is in lane, you can easily sneak behind them and pick up a kill thanks to your steroids.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lika SunRyze","date":"2016-07-17T08:40:11.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please state your reason, it will help me lots :D","replies":[]}]}
