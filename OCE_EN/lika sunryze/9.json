I was wondering if they were legal. I searched this up and i found mixed answers some said that a rioter said that they are allowed as long as they dont influence gameplay, some said they got banned (in NA and EUW)\n\nI kinda dont want to get banned therefore, as the title says.. Will i get banned using custom skins and custom HUDS.\n\nfor example using godfist leesin as appose to original and using a Diamond themed HUD.\n\nThanks in advance,","replies":[{"poster":"Lika SunRyze","date":"2017-05-22T10:10:17.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HELP!!","replies":[]}]}
