(use to main vayne so i know a decent amount about her)\n\nThe main thing is that for vayne i have seen many builds, for example, hurricane build (saw it on Phylol youtube), the youmuss build ive seen going around and finally the standard build i ran with before all this new stuff, Bork into crit.\nSo question is... which build(s) are better and which build is good for which situation.\nalso if you have some spare time tell me the build because im not fully sure what the full build may look like.\nHope you can help me climb :D (btw in gold 4 20 lp if that helps)\n\nAlso what are your thoughts on cull, should i buy it or not, not just for vayne though. For example should i buy it on jinx and ezreal if im against someone like twitch, or should i buy it when im against kogmaw?\n\nIf you need more information let me know! :D\n\nThanks in advance, {{champion:67}} \nLika Sunryze","replies":[{"poster":"o02GD4U0o","date":"2016-09-30T11:14:29.875+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/86YBMi1o-how-ito-build-vayne \n\nI just made it hope that helps","replies":[{"poster":"Lika SunRyze","date":"2016-10-01T04:21:50.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=o02GD4U0o,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=33o8njIE,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-09-30T11:14:29.875+0000)\n>\n> http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/86YBMi1o-how-ito-build-vayne \n> \n> I just made it hope that helps\n\nVery deatiled, i like it a lot, ill be sure to try out some of those builds.\nThank you","replies":[{"poster":"o02GD4U0o","date":"2016-10-02T03:00:23.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nw :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"theshermanator","date":"2016-09-30T05:06:23.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CORE: Statikk Shiv -> Infinity Edge -> Phantom Dancer (and Berserker's Greaves when you feel like it)\nNext options: Bloodthirster, Mercurial Scimitar, Lord Dominik's Regards.\n\nYou can, but I don't recommend, rarely picking up Blade of the Ruined King.\n\nAbility leveling: Q -> W -> E\n\nThis is just the current Vayne meta.
