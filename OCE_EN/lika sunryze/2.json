The only place where i can attach my laptop to an Ethernet cable is my second sitting room where i have to lie down and play on the floor.\n\nI was wondering how i can fix this an not have to use an Ethernet every time i play in order to prevent ping spikes. \n_(so i can play on my comfortable chair and use my desk instead of lying down on the floor)_\n\nShould re-install league? would that help?\n\nIf you need any more information let me know, hope you can help!\nThanks in advance :D\n\n**_Solved_**\nI re-installed the game.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-08-07T06:49:10.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nYou might have luck with removing anything that could be causing any interference between you and your router, moving closer to the router, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Lika SunRyze","date":"2016-08-07T07:29:25.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SephirothSG,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=9Xwipav8,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-08-07T06:49:10.962+0000)\n>\n> Hey there,\n> \n> You might have luck with removing anything that could be causing any interference between you and your router, moving closer to the router, etc.\n\nIll give it a go and get back to you when my league actually starts xD\nThanks!","replies":[]}]}]}
