Sounds weird I know. But I&#039;ve re-installed and deleted all local files and redid keybindings. Still doesnt work. The weird thing is, its only an issue on 1 account. My others work perfectly fine. \r\n2: Shop GUI is too big. Basically cant sell items. So the game is unplayable past a certain point. Because I buy like 2 doran items early game and usually sell them but cant because the fucking shop is too big. I tried emailing support but your verify email doesnt work. I&#039;m so mad right now. Its all on this 1 account. No other issues on any other accounts. And ive used 4 different mouses. Same issue. Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-14T12:47:04.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nYour settings are saved to the server, that would be why you're experiencing these issues on only one of your accounts. To resolve this follow the steps below.\n\n1. Log into your game client.\n2. Delete the games config folder, including persistedsettings.json and input.INI\n3. Launch a custom game, confirm settings are set to defaults.\n4. Exit the game, your settings will then sync to the server.\n\nHope this helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Dean6Winchester7","date":"2016-01-15T17:11:18.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks dude, I love you so much.
