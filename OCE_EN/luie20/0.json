I left to rectify the issue, On reconnecting I got &#039;the game will now exit due to prolonged inactivity&#039; which meant i had to reconnect a 2nd time. to top it off leave buster came on saying I would not agree to leave anymore games. This is pathetic. This bug has occured twice where i cant purchase items and for me to leave to help my team out so i can buy items 25 mins in, and then to be kicked and have to reconnect is disgusting, cudos to riot for makeing people afk from the game longer.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-04-19T23:42:51.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> On reconnecting I got &#039;the game will now exit due to prolonged inactivity&#039; which meant i had to reconnect a 2nd time. \n\n\nThat sounds to me like you took so long to reconnect the game realised you were AFK and auto-kicked you. The same thing happens if you sit in base and don't move for like 10 minutes.\n\nIf it seriously takes you that long to connect to a game, I suggest getting an upgrade on your computer, or you know, at least giving it some basic maintenance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-04-19T13:13:36.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> leave buster came on saying I would not agree to leave anymore games.\n\nThat happens the **FIRST** time you get marked as AFK/DC. No worries.","replies":[]}]}
