As it stands now, players are given less RP for a win when that happens. We have seen players voice their frustration with that system and we agree with them. It was an unintended side effect of how MMR calculations worked in-game and we are fixing it in the upcoming patch. We&#039;ll have more info on that as we get closer to the fix. \r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nthis is what the rocket league dev team are doing about afk in ranked.\r\n\r\nleague has been around for years and you guys have yet to even consider fixing this PERSISTENT issue. players still struggle with this on a daily basis and it is the cause of many people deranking when they dont deserve it.\r\n\r\nthey even implemented a system BEFORE releasing ranked which is more than riot has done in years/ever.\r\n\r\nwhy is this still an issue and why cant the dev team at riot who have and HAVE HAD more time and money than rocket league devs do something about it .","replies":[]}
