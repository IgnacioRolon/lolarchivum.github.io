I was in a skype call at the time and everyone else on my team had froze too. After we all restarted our clients there was no reconnect option and no sign of the game in our match history. Today I decided to play another game on the same champ, same skin too and the same sequence of events happened, I ulted, they used hourglass and after it had finished the game froze and everyone dropped, no sign of it on match history again. It was norms, not ranked so i'm certain I wasn't drop hacked twice in a row. I don't have any screenshots of the first game but here's the screen on the second game after we all froze.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-04T06:15:33.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OH MY GOD\n\nTHAT IS AMAZING\n\nTHE GLORIOUS GOLDEN GOLDEN-DISED TENTACLES OF JUSTICE IS TOO MUCH FOR THE POOR GAME TO BEAR\n\nOh yeah, this probably belongs on the [Report a Bug](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report) board instead of here.","replies":[]}]}
