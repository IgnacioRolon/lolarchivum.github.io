The client to download is majorly out of date(15/9/2014?). Any chance this can be updated at a regular basis so it will save some people having to go through gigs of updates just to get back up to current patch date. I&#039;m kind of lucky and have the luxury of unlimited internet usage per month but many others aren&#039;t as fortunate. So in a way it will keep them happy as well.","replies":[]}
