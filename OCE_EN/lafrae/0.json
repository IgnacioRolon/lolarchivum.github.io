Such as that of me being in Platinum and them being in Gold and Silver. When I was in Gold, I couldn&#039;t play with a Bronze 1 friend. So is this restriction back up when I&#039;m in Platinum and they are in Silver? Or can it function like the Counter-Strike: GO competitive queue system whereas if you have a full 5 queue, you are able to rank. If not, I wish it is.\r\n\r\nIf anyone can explain how the system works because I haven&#039;t been able to find the answers I&#039;m looking for, I&#039;ll be grateful.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-04T05:44:09.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's with all the NA %%%s posting on OCE boards lately?","replies":[{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-09-05T05:41:04.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=QAPLA,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=XYQPMAEk,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-09-04T05:44:09.353+0000)\n>\n> What&#x27;s with all the NA %%%s posting on OCE boards lately?\n\nits very easy to permabanned on NA","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"idc","date":"2016-09-04T10:21:54.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can queue up with anyone 1 whole tier above and below you.\n\ne.g. If you're gold 4, you can play with anyone between silver 4 and plat 4.\n\nIf you're in a 5 man group, and your highest player is plat 4, but you're gold 4 and want to invite your silver 4 friend, the silver 4 player cannot join because the plat 4 player is over 1 whole tier above him. This also works if the plat 4 player tried to join the room. Everyone in your 5 man needs to be within 1 whole tier below and above each other. Hope that helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glow","date":"2016-09-04T04:09:26.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure of the specifics, as I understand it you can only queue with players one tier below or above. So if you are gold 1, you can queue with players who are silver 1 through to plat 1. But you couldn't queue with a silver 2 player as this is counted as more than one tier. Also for ranked teams (not dynamic mode) you can queue with anybody. Hope that helps","replies":[]}]}
