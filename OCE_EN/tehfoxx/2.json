For example, allow game owners to call a vote to kick/remove a player from the game\r\n3. Add a link to the riot support pages on the games menu(Next to settings button or in the help menu on the client)\r\n\r\nthese are needed for players who enjoy custom games(like Hide & seek & others)","replies":[{"poster":"TehFoxx","date":"2015-02-10T16:23:15.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bumps","replies":[]}]}
