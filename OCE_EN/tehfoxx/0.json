The pause function is a completely useless function that it's only purpose is for trolls to ruin the game even more(best way to fix it is limit the use of the /pause to 3 times per user, remove it completely or allow games owners to disable this function \n\n2. Game owners need more rights ingame(& in lobby/team select) to deal with trolls or players that just ruin it for everyone else. For example, allow game owners to call a vote to kick/remove a player from the game ingame\n\n3. i know kicking someone ingame will leave the other team 1 player short but could also add an option for the game owner(or other players) to invite someone to take over(they will still have all the gold, items & kdr the last person had before they were kicked), they obviously won't be able to change champ but will help the game become \n\n4. Allow game owners to undo a ban/kick in the lobby/team select as theres times you might kick the wrong person\n\n5. Maybe have a minimizable separate chat box ingame(for any game) for whispers & have separate tabs for different conversations or could put it on the normal chat box but have tabs(like in some mmos)\n\n6. Add a link to the riot support pages on the games menu(Next to settings button or in the help menu on the client)\n\nthese are needed for players who enjoy custom games(like Hide & seek & others)","replies":[{"poster":"TehFoxx","date":"2015-02-22T00:07:12.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"updated with some extra ideas","replies":[]},{"poster":"TehFoxx","date":"2015-02-10T10:28:51.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Made one in misc hope one of them see it though as it's an annoying issue in custom games","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-09T11:02:45.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With a company like Riot, you'd think they would have already implemented these simple features in.\n\nNope.\n\nAlso, you'd probably want to move this discussion over to the [Player Creations board](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations), and if you want a red to see it, the [Miscellaneous](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous) board.\n\nBest of luck!","replies":[]}]}
