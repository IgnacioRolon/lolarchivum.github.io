My order of skill is Sup, top, adc, mid, jg.\r\nI can&#039;t find any other runes i want, and i feel i have all the pages i need too.\r\n\r\nSo out of those three who would be worth me getting/learning. As with most champs the more you play them the better you play against them, so thats a consideration, but I watch the LCS so i&#039;m pretty damn familiar with their kits (I&#039;ve zhonya&#039;d so many death marks Zed players hate on me so bad). I could get Lucian, but i don&#039;t feel like his kit is my thing. Same deal with graves...\r\n\r\nIf you reccomend me something, give me a reason so i can properly consider it. Been sitting on this IP for a week now, without making a decision. Won&#039;t take me that long to build up another 6300, but for now i&#039;ve got enough for one top tier champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2015-04-21T07:10:18.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say reksai due to when you play ranks the most banned out of those 3 are zed and it gets banned a lot Bronze-Gold not sure about Plat above","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrPine","date":"2015-04-20T23:58:02.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are willing to put in time to learn, play rengar.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-04-20T17:30:49.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Judging by the champs you play id say reksai, but zed is probably the best option.
