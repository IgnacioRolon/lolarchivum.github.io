I&#039;ve done so twice in my short time in ranked and both times to avoid players who were going to feed because something happened. In the first instance someone accidentally banned a champ someone else was hovering, and in the second someone picked a champ someone else was hovering (they didn&#039;t explain and ask to swap, just instalocked teemo and told us they were feeding). There&#039;s no point in playing these games and its better for the 3 or 4 non salty people that someone dodges and no one has to deal with one person who intends to ruin your game. Many would say &#039;just play the game and then report them&#039;, but that doesn&#039;t stop my LP loss (i know you lose some for dodging but its less than losing a game) or get me back the time wasted.\r\n\r\n I don&#039;t want to show a pattern of dodging because so many people in and around my division think intentional feeding is the answer to disputes in lobby. And if not enough people report the feeder after the game (if its played) they&#039;re not even punished. Its not likely that they will intentionally feed again for some time unless they have reason again. Yet I have to take the punishment for taking the dodge for the team ( i support main) with no chance to explain myself.\r\n\r\nThe problem comes with policing it. Riot (as far as i know) uses automated punishment if players present undesirable behavior which is simply a matter of being reported lots. A system such as this would require someone actually check the chat in the lobby to verify that the dodge was reasonable. Otherwise the system could be abused to dodge for bad reasons.\r\n\r\nSo i don&#039;t know what can be done, but something needs to be... Perhaps the ability to report someone before the game and if all other members do as well the lobby is cancelled with no one having to take a dodge penalty. The reported players behavior could then be investigated.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-04-16T22:10:01.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Quivz,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=9RPoQAZf,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-04-15T00:34:46.958+0000)\n>\n> So sometimes you have a really legitimate reason to dodge.\n\nI believe the word you are looking for is \"excuse\", not \"reason\".\n\n> I have to take the punishment for taking the dodge\n\nYes, because it's against the rules. There is no reason to exempt you from the rules just because someone else is breaking them (rather, simply \"threatening\" to break them).\n\n> Perhaps the ability to report someone before the game\n\nThis is possible, you know. There's no feature in-game for it but you can use the [support section](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) of the website to report undesirable players, which is particularly helpful in situations where you can't use the normal report features (such as a \"dispute\" in champ select where someone dodges). Though if you choose to do so make sure to include a screenshot (I can't be sure but I don't think chat logs from dodged games are kept on record).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-04-16T12:35:26.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the current queue dodging system, because you take a small LP loss for a dodge which does not punish the other players in champion select. If Riot were actively reading reports, then yes a reason could be given, and they could watch out for those players in future, but people have the right to play the game they like to, and some people like to tease with \"feeding\", and in the game they are totally different. Testing other players mettle, if you like. I'd still implement the -3lp loss regardless if there was a report system for dodging in place.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-04-16T06:15:04.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No one wants to play a game where they feel the team is already at each other's throats or someone is threatening to feed simply because they lost their position. {{item:3009}} {{summoner:4}}","replies":[]}]}
