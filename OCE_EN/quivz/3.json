Basically adobe air or or flash cause me intermittent BSODs. The problem is this sometimes causes my computer to reset as soon as the lobby loads. I've never purposely abandoned a game or purposely afk'd. In the last few days i've also had internet problems, i'm over quota so my ping is lower, but still under 100 which is more than quick enough for a lagless game... Some games i connect fine and play the whole round with no problems and no lag.  For some reason i occasionally get a round where I can't connect or maintain my connection through the whole game.\r\n\r\nToday i had a game that ran fine and then i had a game where i had issues. I couldn't load into the game. So i tried closing the game and reconnecting. That didn't work, so i tried closing the whole client and reconnecting and i still couldn't load in. So i tried resetting my computer and reconnecting and i still couldn't load in. So i gave up and disconnected and then came back later to see if i could get another game, but i was greeted with a warning box which told me that leaving games was harmful to the community and required I type \"I agree\" into a text box signalling my agreement to not abandon any other games. As a result i'm scared to start any other games in case my computer crashes or my internet bites me again.\r\n\r\nI'm doing everything i can to fix my BSOD issue, which has come down to getting a new computer (the parts are on order). And my internet rolls over tomorrow so that should resolve that side of things.\r\n\r\nI don't know what to do. I love LoL, I've been playing for years. I want to play, but i don't want to be penalized for problems beyond my control. I'd like to be playing now, but as i said the risk seems too great.\r\n\r\nWhat should i do?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-13T06:20:53.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> which has come down to getting a new computer\n\nMan, that's a desperate move. This game has been programmed to run on an operating system, which was designed to run on all computers (of minimal specs, that is).\n\nUltimately, what you should do is fix the problem on this computer, to at least *know* why it wasn't working (maybe it's your ISP?), but it's probably already too late, for you've ordered the parts.\n\nMy best suggestion is to wait for the new computer and play League on that. If you absolutely need to play League, then play some bot/custom games, where the risk of being punished is a lot less severe.\n\nWhatever you do, best of luck with it!","replies":[{"poster":"Quivz","date":"2015-02-13T08:33:23.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually I've only been playing bot games since this problem started. i don't want to ruin it for everyone else. And my computer upgrade is a combination of \"about time i upgraded\" combined with the fact i haven't been able to find a solution despite exhaustive attempts. Software has been ruled out as the cause so it must be hardware, so I'm replacing everything piecemeal Until the problem is resolved..","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-13T22:59:06.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Software has been ruled out as the cause so it must be hardware,\n\nYou might be surprised. I mean, most software is written by thousands of people working in collaboration, based on the work of thousands of people coding in the language working in collaboration beforehand. There's many instances where code just doesn't agree with itself.\n\nOne thing that concerns me is that you said \"replacing every... piece\", suggesting that you *aren't* building a new computer, but that you're just replacing the old parts with new ones on your existing computer. That is highly unlikely to solve your issue. It would simply be best to construct a new computer entirely from scratch and install a fresh OS onto it.","replies":[{"poster":"Quivz","date":"2015-02-15T11:11:37.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been building computers since the 90's. The case means nothing, its just a bunch of switches. I'm replacing all other components so its a new computer. Since i know exactly how software is assembled and since i've formatted my OS and reproduced the BSOD with no other software installed AND since others with the same hardware are unable to reproduce the BSOD, i know, by process of elimination and occam's razor, that a piece of hardware is failing.\n\nHow long does this warning hang over my head? I've been playing my first win of the day and then logging out.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-16T09:01:40.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">since i've formatted my OS\n\nI was fearing that you were just putting that hard-drive into a new rig without formatting it first, but glad to see that's not what you did! Neither did I know of the rigorous tested you implemented beforehand; my apologies for doubting your technical savvy.\n\nJust to clarify about the consequences of leaving a game. Every time you leave a game, either intentionally or because of reasons out of your control, a leave marker is permanently added to your account. This marker is invisible to the public and only the Riot behavioural staff can see it. If you accumulate a certain amount of leave markers within a certain time frame, a leavebuster penalty is applied to your account. The only way to remove it is by playing PvP games. Continued leaving of games will result in larger penalties, eventually leading to your account being banned temporarily. *Even further* leaving will cause a Riot staff member to overview your account and possibly perma-ban you.\n\nIf you haven't gotten any penalties so far, though, you have nothing to fear.\n\nI wish you the best of luck with running it on your new computer.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
