There&#039;s little i can do to affect the game as a whole if my team doesn&#039;t play the game well. I&#039;m dedicated to a path that means i can only provide cc and vision and maybe some front line tankiness. When my team continuously pushes too far with no vision or goes in to die one by one at baron there&#039;s little i can do 1 v 5 at the nexus turrets except pad the enemy teams kda. It feels that no matter how good i do to support my team and try to guide them to better patterns of play, its still just luck where your LP is going to end up if you&#039;re playing support. As a carry role, while difficult, you could make up for other bad patterns of play, by babysitting or split push, but what can i do as a support?\r\n\r\ntypical thought process: *looks at minimap* &quot;Well top shouldn&#039;t be that far up. He&#039;s gonna die.&quot; *top dies* &quot;And mid doesn&#039;t seem to think they&#039;ll swing back and collapse on him and tower dive but of course they will&quot; *mid dies* &quot;Well I&#039;ll ward around top now cos they&#039;ll swing to dragon so we can maybe push some waves out... And of course my ADC is now going to walk into river to try and steal dragon 1v5&quot; *adc dies* &quot;And now top and mid who&#039;ve respawned are gonna funnel into dragon side jng with no vision cos i&#039;ve just moved vision top so we can push away from their carries, who were at dragon, but should now be taking our jng camps&quot; *mid and top die again* &quot;Well i better drop a ward in baron cos that&#039;s where they&#039;ll be going now, at least we&#039;ll know where they are and how many they commit&quot; *jng and ADC die at baron* &quot;Well i can sit on the fountain or i can try and save nexus turrets, but I&#039;m probably gonna die&quot; *Die under nexus turrets, team flames me for not saving nexus turrets 1 v 5* &quot;...Sigh&quot;\r\n\r\nI tend to go up or even in laning phase (unless i&#039;ve got a particular suicidal ADC *looking at all you trist players who jump in every time the CD is up*), but once this is over its like watching a comedy of errors. I imagine its pretty bad when you&#039;re carrying and the other lanes are failing, but as a support i don&#039;t even get to do that...","replies":[{"poster":"Quivz","date":"2016-04-13T08:45:00.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So i've taken heaps of this advice and things have gotten a bit better... mostly playing when kids would be in bed or at school has got me into good games. So thats my biggest tip to anyone wanting to climb out of lower tiers. \n\nBut my LP still feels out of my control. The games have been closer and when i lose it more often feels like i've lost to a better team, but often i feel like I've just lost because i've been matched with one or two people on my team who know what they're doing and a couple of people who miss position so often (or jump in on tristana) and make terrible game decisions. I guess its just part of the game that even when you play a near perfect game, your LP is still in the hands of the worst player you get matched with...\n\nOther laughable suicides for your entertainment: Falcor (aurelion sol) on lowish health and team keeps getting killed by his orbiting stars trying to get in there for an auto or 2. Singed chasing. 'Just one more cs'. 'Quick! They're at dragon...' and 'Quick! they're at Baron...' We've lost an inhibitor and supers are pouring in, but i guess I'll chase the enemy team all the way down mid and leave the support to save the nexus. 'I'm J4. I'm supposed to trap myself in here with a fed vayne and gnar and get knocked against my own walls like a ping pong ball right?'. Okay this next ones a bit understandable without comms... I dive in as leona with all my cc so my carries can get out alive, but of course they see that as an engage and follow me in to die. Landing a disengage bubble with nami and everyone turns to try and burst the tank. Singed chasing. Turret on 50 hp and ADC goes under it alone against 2 or 3 expecting it to save them. Kha jumping on anything that moves. TP way too deep behind enemy team while we're trying to disengage then 'Why you no help?!' And did i mention people who still go Singed chasing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crunch","date":"2016-03-30T13:41:25.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that playing Support may feel like you're babysitting sometimes, but really you need to be always looking to make opportunities. You aren't having to focus on farming, so you have time to guide your team in the right decisions. \n\n1. Time EVERYTHING. If you're aware of everyones cooldowns and can time the important ones, you will create more opportunities to captialize off. \n\n2. You can make huge plays on early game roams. Supports such as Blitzcrank, Leona, Morgana and Thresh have very potent roams around level 3-4 that if timed right can snowball your mid laner.\n\n3. Take time to guide your team. Think of the best ways you can win the game and communicate it with your team. Be the one who makes the pick by baiting the baron and hiding in the bush. You tell the Jax to split push while your team focuses on pressuring bot. Half of the reason solo queue can be frustrating is because you're on a team with solo mentalities and different ideas. Uniting your team onto good strategy and objective control will grant you huge leads in your games. Use the vision to make the call. \n\n4. Try to realize what your role can be in a composition. A lot of the team strategy will work around the Support, so make sure your team knows how you can work best. (i.e Dive, Poke/Disengage, Peel, Pick) and then make sure you're playing the game as efficiently as possible.\n\n5. Support is essentially making the most of what you have. Make sure your item pathing is as gold efficient as possible and fulfills a need within the team comp! Please don't build Sunfire on supports in general. Unless you're incredibly ahead, it's not your role to deal 40dps. Something which would keep a carry alive (who typically deal 700+dps) will always be better in the long run.","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2016-03-28T21:47:18.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless you're duo with an ADC who you know can carry in the lategame, you should be looking to get a big advantage for your team early. Pick playmaking supports, roam alot, try to identify the better players on your team who are worth snowballing and peeling for, and the better players on the enemy team who you need to shut down. Also consider taking ignite in order to punish mistakes and snowball games harder. A good support can make a ton of stuff happen especially in the first 20 minutes or so, and even though your team will inevitibly throw sometimes, you will win more often than not if you've got a big lead early.  Also with your \"typical thought process\" statements, are you acting on these thoughts? If you see people doing blatantly dumb stuff, ping them back, alert them to the jungler running right over there ward or the guy you know is hiding in the bush they're about to facecheck. It doesn't work every time, but you can stop people making dumb plays fairly often if you're alert enough. And not being able to defend the nexus turrets 1v5? Thats not just a support problem, you've probably lost the game at that point no matter what role you're playing.","replies":[{"poster":"Quivz","date":"2016-03-29T00:38:19.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've tried roaming, but then i get flamed for leaving them alone, and a lot of them die... I always seem to end up against a really good duo or premade that just performs better. I do act on my thoughts, but some people just dont listen to the pings. I must admit i've had games where the team has taken my advice and its improved even if we didn't win. best game i ever had was an adc that just took charge and told me exactly what he wanted and when and we owned the map very quickly.","replies":[{"poster":"andyMak","date":"2016-03-29T14:30:30.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're not there they should play safe. it's not your fault they died","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-03-29T14:26:44.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been a support main for a couple years and I can confirm that even in Diamond there are games I feel just as helpless as you do. Sometimes I truly wish I queued up as any other role because I'd like to have more control (and sometimes I take a needed breather from support). Ultimately, it always feels like these roles are missing that something special and I come running right back. \n\nAt the end of the day you should play the role that makes you happy. If you can, at the very least, have fun or feel like you've learnt something it'll pay dividends in the long run. Not only will you find yourself better able to keep your mentality solid in frustrating games but you'll pick up some neat tricks that'll help you turn around some of those dire games too. \n\nLeague is a learning process, like any other, that takes persistence and time. Perhaps playing support is one of the less reliable and long-winded methods but it is possible to climb with it. Focus on playing champs that you enjoy, suit your comp and you consistently make big plays with and  you'll eventually become confident enough in your own ability that others will be inspired to follow your example.","replies":[]},{"poster":"vonklaude","date":"2016-03-29T08:33:04.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Quivz,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=MLwwdqVK,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-03-28T09:16:23.302+0000)\n>\n> So i&#039;m starting to feel that as a support main i don&#039;t really have any control over my LP. \n\nI feel the same way. Supports multiply team power rather than add to it. Janna and Soraka are good examples. In Gold on up they are upper half of top ten support champions. In Bronze they are bottom half. They don't add power, they multiply it.\n\nWhat I'm trying at present is friending any ADCs that I play with who have a good play style. My hope is to get back into games with people I can rely on. Much the same point as Princess Yaia. Probably to rank as a Support you must get into premades...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-03-28T14:22:19.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While it is sometimes frustrating and hard to climb as a support, it can be done. \n\nHere are some tips from _**LGC Elam**_.\n\n>**Be more than just a physical support be one in chat as well.**\n\n>What I mean by this is that when you are playing solo queue you will play with all types of players. Ones that are having a good day, those who aren’t ones who are in the middle. When you are playing support try to keep your teams spirit high and be the voice that your team needs. Sometimes people say that a simple smile can make peoples day, a simple gj in chat after someone gets a kill in your lane or another can do the same thing. While you are doing this as well you will notice that your team will start paying attention to the chat a lot more because of you making it is a positive envorement. With this in mind use this to your advantage to make shot calls for the team. Call rotations, ward placements, keep the team focused what needs to happen next so they can all follow the same goal!\n\n>**Keep your champion pool short and sweet so that you can auto pilot and focus on other things.**\n\n>When I say this I think it is best to play 1-3 champions in each role so that you can really get a grasp for how they play. Once you play them enough you will notice that you won’t have to think much when playing them and it will become natural to do what you need. When you reach this point you can play the basics of the champion without dedicating too much brain power to it and use the rest of it in other areas such as more complicated things in the game. Examples of this would be if you want to roam, rotating where your wards are around the map or thinking ahead of time in the game of what you want to be doing in X minutes.\n\n>**Keep doing what you are doing and don’t lose heart!**\n\n>The best thing that you can do as a support main is keep positive. Learn from every mistake and help your team learn as well. Even in games that you think you can’t possibly win you can still learn something from it. What I would suggest is to start a journal of all your games. You don’t have to write out big paragraphs about every single one of them but write down at least one thing that you could have done better that game. At the end of the week go back and have a look at what the most common thing that you could have improved on is. Then going into the next week use the extra brain power that you don’t have to use because of auto piloting to make sure you do that well!\n\n>**Final notes\n**\n>All up keep going, you can climb it just take time. Everyone hits a wall at some point in their ranked journey and that is normal. All you have to do is find what is you need to improve on change it and keep going! If you have any questions or you want to add me in game feel free to ask. As an AD Carry main I would be happy to bot lane with you in a normal game or two and tell you what I pick up on from said games that you can improve on.\n\n> [Original thread here](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/f0m8TsM4-im-problem-as-a-support-player)\n\nClimbing as a support is so much easier when you can communicate clearly with your team, and bond with your adc so you don't have to keep changing up your play style. [Do this by creating a dynamic queue premade](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment). Your games will be less toxic, more fun and you will get lots of bonuses like hex tech stuff, extra IP and mastery points :D\n\nGood luck  ♥","replies":[{"poster":"Quivz","date":"2016-03-29T00:40:40.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lot of good stuff there.

X has no Flash or what ever summoner they have and TIME IT! it will allow you to go back in the chat when you are wanting to gank mid lane when backing, normal supports do that as they come back into lane as it allows you to get your mid laner ahead or put more pressure on the lane and able to place wards in the spots you are wanting in the main brush or near dragon. \nFlash is 5 minutes not that hard to time. unless they have the mastery for lower summoners","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
