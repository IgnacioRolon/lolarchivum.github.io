I don&#039;t know if his lore will be approved but i thought it was a awesome idea. \n\nLore: In a school in Noxus, Draven and Castors three Children got into a fight, Darius rushed to help Draven His younger brother. A massive fight between the 5 broke out of control and this awakened Darius power that no one had seen before. Once everything settled down Darius had killed Castors three children. Castor was walking into the school after he had finished his duties in the kitchen, to pick up his three kids, but he found them dead. Castor knew that the grads were close, he had hardly and combat experience. So he piked up his three sons projects and says to Darius &quot;The next time we meet will be your last breath&quot;. He walks out of the school.     \n\nHe left Noxus and everyday since he trained harder and harder until he had mastered the three projects. But he knew it wasn&#039;t enough to beet Darius. So he decided to try to find away to bring his three children back to help him fight. With his dark knowledge he knew a way to bring them back for a sort time to help him. But what he didn&#039;t know is that he was near a demacia outpost. He was surprised attacked and surrounded, he surrendered himself to them, said &quot;Take me to Garen, The might of demacia&quot;. The Solders Laughed and took him to a cell where he met Garen. \n\nGaren said &quot;what do you want? Your a Noxucan why would you want to speak with demacians. You have done your far amount of damage so.........&quot;\n\n&quot;Because Darius killed my three children and i want justice for what he has done. I bag of you please let me join your ranks. I want to destroy Noxus. I don&#039;t care if you put a couple of gards to watch me every hour of every day. Just please let me join your ranks&quot;. Said Castor\n\nGaren couldn&#039;t comprehend what he just heard. But he sore something in his eyes, &quot;so you want to join our ranks&quot; he laughed. &quot;I&#039;ll let you join the Damacian ranks but know this if you ever ever ever try to take demacia down from the inside, i will kill you personally. Gards watch him all the time and stay with him. I&#039;m also watching. one foot out of line and that&#039;s your head, got it?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes Admiral&quot; Said Castor\n\nGaren and Castor became great friends and they fought with each other to make each other stronger until the day where castor fights with Darius.  \n\n&quot;To cook and have food, or not to cook and have no food&quot;. \n\n\nCastors Kit:\n Auto attacks: throws knifes\n\nPassive: Food Poisoning. \nIf Him/Enemy eats a rotten stake he poisons for 3 seconds (this is always on). (Maybe 30-60 second cool down with 15%+ damage) But he learns from his mistake and the next ability/dish dose 15%+ damage/healing to the enemy/himself/allies. The next rotten dish is 15%+ in damage so it could be your last If eaten.\nOver the 3 seconds he dose 35% of his total physical damage plus (+0 ability power) \n\nQ:Dice Time. (6 seconds) Throws three knives. The middle knife goes straight and the two other knives zigzag from side to side that cross the middle three times before returning to him. So all three knives intersect twice and on the third intersect they return. (when Intersect all knifes do damage if hit a champion/monster, but that would be a lot of damage, so maybe you only take damage from one knife) Deals 20/60/100/140/180 (+0) physical damage. I don&#039;t know how long the range that it would be so small-medium.\n\nW: Prepare. (8 seconds) \nHe eats one of three meals.\n\nTo activate each meal you hold w and then release between the two numbers.\n(it could be a 1 second hold between them).\n\nThe 1st Recipe time is: 2-2.5 seconds to activate.&nbsp; \n1st Recipe: (Entree) When eaten it gives him 1 quarter of his heath missing back over 15-20 seconds (+15% if passive active).\n(if activated again within 16.5 seconds than it just refreshes the time back to 15-20 seconds no stacks and the +15% doesn&#039;t work when refreshed if on the first one)\n\nThe 2nd Recipe time is: 1-1.4 and 2.5-3 seconds to activate. (Range Medium) \n2nd Recipe (Rotten Stake) you have 1.5 seconds to throw the rotten stake (once activated) that explodes once thrown (radius small-Medium) that poisons anything in the radius (allies included maybe) and slows them for 2 seconds. After the 1.5 second time limit expires he eats the rotten stake and gets food poisoning.&nbsp;\n\nThe 3rd Recipe time is: 1.5-2 seconds to activate. \n3rd Recipe. (Sticky Date Podding) When activated it gives him increase +15% movement, attack speed. However if he eats this more than once within 16.5 seconds he gets food poisoning and not the movement and attack speed buff. (Also this still stays 16.5 seconds with cool down reduction)\n\nIf you activate w between 0-0.9 and 3-3.5 seconds you get instant food poisoning that lasts for 5 seconds and slows you for 3.5 seconds. If this is activated than its other +10% damage on top and last the 5 seconds.\n(This Ability Dose not cycle like TF cards)\n\nE: Mouse Trap. (13 seconds) (once Placed it takes 0.5 seconds to activate and lasts for ) \nHe sets a mouse trap (2/3/4/4/5) when triggered by a enemy/monster he can pull out his gun (in a certain distance) shoot a food bullet that gives them food poisoning. \nThe trap holds the enemy/monster for 1.5 seconds. If Castor doesn&#039;t shoot the trap bites the enemy/monster that dose 25/65/105/145/185 (+0) ability power.\n(He can place 8 in total but only store so many)\n\nR: Long Lost Children (165 seconds)\nHe brings back his 3 kids and they can take damage and also do 250/300/350 (+0) ability power.\nEach one has a different ability.\n1st chilled: allows to cast a q at the same time as him.\n2nd chilled: what ever recipe you chose from your w he also casts. \nif you chose recipe 1 it heals 1 quarter of the closest 2 players and himself over the 15-20 seconds.\nif you chose recipe 2 you and your chilled throw a rotten stake. but if the chilled eats the rotten stake there is a 2.5 seconds delay and then explodes and gives the other two children food poisoning. which intern after 1 second they both explode. (during the delay than cant cast any ability)\nif you chose recipe 3 it gives you and the three children the movement and attack speed buff.\n3rd chilled: allows to set a instant trap and if all 5 enemy champs step on five traps he can shoot them all.\n\nI was thinking that his body is the same size as jins or a little bigger and have a apron (with stains) on him. He could be a little tanky. \nFor his traps, he could be wearing a belt and pulls them off the belt and places them down.\n\nGameplay: \n\nWhen two or more enemy's/monsters step on his Traps he can only chose one to shoot, unless his ult is active. other champs can block the shot.\n\nIn his ult (once activated) there could be there choices for the children (like formations) \n1-the First one Is they run in a circle around him so they protect him. \n2-they could do a scout to the three closest bushes.\n3-they attack who's closest to them.\n\nThe lore is a draft and not polished yet.  \nHow do you like this champion? If changers are needed to be made than they can be changed. This is just an idea and i hope you like him.","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-05-28T20:14:09.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry, I just can't make sense of this.
