Keep in mind, the ban should only be revoked if it was made in error. Based on what you've said, it was a just ban and, as such, the appeal will likely be denied. To my knowledge, that's the only way you could have the ban revoked.\n\nAs for posting on other regions boards, that doesn't fall under \"ban evading\". \"Ban evading\" would be making/using an alternate account to post on a board where you *have* been banned, such as (in your case) making/using a smurf to post on NA. I suppose part of that is that different regions have different communities, which means that behaviours will be moderated differently. For example, you might find the mods on OCE boards are a bit more lenient on certain behaviours than NA mods, and vice verse.\n\nQuite simply, it wouldn't make sense to ban someone on one region for something that isn't considered \"unacceptable behaviour\" in that region, just because it's considered \"unacceptable\" in another. That said, many behaviours are considered unacceptable on most/all regions boards, so it always pays to keep an eye on how different behaviours are moderated on a given regions boards before trying to go beyond what is commonly accepted.","replies":[{"poster":"SecondAirbane","date":"2017-10-19T07:03:23.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ill explain after this game 1 part actually was in error but they wont unban me due to past history apparently","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-10-19T20:44:14.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Make a Smurf :D And level it to 10 and boom new boards account","replies":[]}]}
