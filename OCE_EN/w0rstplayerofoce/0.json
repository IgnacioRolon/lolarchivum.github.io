Now my suspensions leading up to this ban were necessary. I was very toxic it came across in chat quite vulgarly; racism, homophobia. All the things that trigger riots team. However. I am shocked to see I have just been banned for screwing around with friends and being passive aggressive to the only one of the only two non-queued up persons in the game. Here are the logs\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nPre-Game\r\nW0rstPlayerOfOCE: take vlad mid\r\nW0rstPlayerOfOCE: i top\r\nIn-Game\r\nW0rstPlayerOfOCE: Shit chroma %%%got\r\nW0rstPlayerOfOCE: kys\r\nW0rstPlayerOfOCE: All good guys I balanced out the toxicity\r\nW0rstPlayerOfOCE: Flamed him a lil in team chat\r\nW0rstPlayerOfOCE: vlad f 1855\r\nW0rstPlayerOfOCE: :???\r\nW0rstPlayerOfOCE: honoured\r\nW0rstPlayerOfOCE: Top quality support\r\nPost-Game\r\nW0rstPlayerOfOCE: 10 notch\r\nW0rstPlayerOfOCE: janna player\r\nW0rstPlayerOfOCE: Top*\r\n\r\nNow. I said &#039;Shit chroma %%%got, kys&#039; after one of the enemies said something along the lines of cute chroma to our zed. To which I jokingly insulted him about it to balance the toxicity, which did come across as a joke as I clearly informed the enemy right after. I also called out vlads flash after he ate a wall with his flash also a joke. When it comes to the talk to my support she literally did the best play a janna could do that was sincere and I did honour her in the end. So it seems I was banned for joking with the word %%%got in it. I do not understand how riot have come this far pandering to such an immature audience of snow flakes. I also do not understand which of the two people in the game could have possibly found any of these comms purely toxic and deemed it worthy of a report. Look honestly i&#039;d like an unban simply because this is a game and what is the point of a game without joking around in comms. Nothing is fun where everyone screams positivity into each others ears, especially in a normal where people are literally just learning and doing their own thing. And overall this is a little light, especially when you look retrospectively at my last suspensions is took 3 games both times of me screaming racism and homophobia to every single person on the team without a shred of sympathy before I was banned but this one took a joke. Unban.","replies":[{"poster":"TTL Rem","date":"2018-07-15T10:16:23.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"kys\" is an insta-ban word, I'm afraid.\n\nOh, well.
