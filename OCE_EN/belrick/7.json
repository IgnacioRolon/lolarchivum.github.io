Then with a nose dived MMR i will then win the majority of my next ten.\r\n\r\nBoth of which sucks. I play  LOL for that 1 in 10 game that is BALANCED and as a result a total blast\r\n\r\nWhy does the player base tolerate this shit?\r\n\r\nWhat shall i do? I know if i click play i am going to lose. its decided, a done deal. me as an average player will be in a team of players completely outclassed by their opponents.\r\nRigged like the US elections","replies":[{"poster":"Belrick","date":"2016-11-30T07:46:31.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Check out my match history.\nStraight wins\nTo straight losses.
