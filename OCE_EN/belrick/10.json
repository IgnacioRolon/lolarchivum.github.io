I tend to get shitty when placed in a team of players clearly outclassed by OUR opponents (i get shitty at riot not the players, ain&#039;t our fault). More when I see players making basic fundamental mistakes i tend to point that out to them. Not nasty or insulting, but I feel compelled to do it because I have the most fun when teams are evenly matched and games are won and lost by split second reactions/decisions. (love these sorts of games).\r\nBut no matter how i word it i always trigger people.\r\n\r\nAnyway so i made honor 5 when i probably shouldnt of and what i found was that i keep getting honor capsules and everyone contains a champion shard.\r\n\r\nWhich would be amazing if i didn&#039;t already own every champ in the game lol (along with enough ip to buy 3 new champs outright)\r\n\r\nGuess i never have to worry about blue essence again... now if only i were good enough to get more mastery tokens ahhahahahahaha\r\n\r\nps: wouldnt it be cool if players could trade loot and there were more rewards other than summoner icons? I know skins are tied to riots income stream so that cannot be touched, but more visual ways of customizing summoners.","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2017-09-07T04:29:01.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Different rewards would be better yes, but try to capitalise on the rewards you are given now as the currency will soon merge and just be 'Blue Essence'. Do remember also that Riot will have a 'Limited Time Only Blue Essence' store, where skins (selected few I believe) will be bought using Blue Essence as people will have a lot due to Refunds (Runes, Rune Pages).","replies":[]},{"poster":"not a girl","date":"2017-09-07T03:47:56.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"disenchant them all. blue essence will be the new currency soon.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-09-07T03:56:43.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah and disenchanting values are going to decrease quite considerably","replies":[]}]}]}
