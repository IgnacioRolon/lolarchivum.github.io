My MMR must be so high Rito &quot;dota2 must succeed&quot; matchmaker must be thinking i&#039;m faker when i&#039;m just an average support who cannot stop a wukong going 0/8 in 10min.\r\n\r\nSo sick of this shiite. I just want matched players pitted against each other, where the damn game isn&#039;t decided by the friggen load screen!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nI HATE HATE HATE the MATCHMAKER!!!

There's still too many boosted bonobos from last year's dynamic queue... it's just gonna take some time to settle, you can't do much about it. And supporting in low elo is not easy.

Sometimes the matchmaking nails it and sometimes it doesn't. Over time you just get used to it. Take each game for itself, with a clear head and trying your best and all that. If it's possible don't even check the ranks, just forget about it, and you'll find that you're unburdened of all sorts of expectations going into a match or disappointment afterwards. \n\nNot too long ago I was one loss from demoting to D5 from D4 and I was matched in a game with 8 Challengers. The game put me on ADC and suffice it to say the tower was pushed in within 5 minutes, the game was over soon after that and I was demoted. Crazy stuff happens to everyone but it doesn't happen every time (as I haven't seen challengers since then). Take it as a learning experience and try again. It's the best anyone can do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-05-28T07:24:35.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been in a situation where I was on 0lp on many divisions and I couldn't risk losing otherwise I'd get demoted.

What was really interesting is when I was doing this some of the players would then try and talk to me in French, German and Swedish which was weird. The only thing that got me was the different VPN locations I would use to connect to game.\n\nCoincidence?\n\nDunno,\n\nBut you could try that, using a VPN to connect to different games.\n\nGL","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-05-27T21:30:17.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best way to play league is to not get emotional,because its a game.\n\nSadly riots top priorities are new champs,skins or any other feature that makes them money and are probably never gonna fix there crappy match making system\n\nIt is what it is, just play the game and try and find fun in every game or its just pointless","replies":[]},{"poster":"xXDatBoi1Xx","date":"2017-05-27T11:52:29.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would just play with friends i would trust so they dont troll","replies":[]}]}
