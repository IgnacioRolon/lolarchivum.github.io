Does other match types count towards match making ranking?\r\n\r\nI am a support, i can NEVER carry no matter how well i play. (sort this out riot ffs.)\r\n\r\nAny tips ?","replies":[{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-09-13T08:10:30.014+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to low elo support life.

Using these supports it's quite viable to be able to carry since if you're good and can win lane hard, you can dominate teamfights later with cc and damage, you becoming more terrifying than the midlaner and can just take objectives with impunity with your adc standing behind you ready to shred towers whilst you murder anyone that's dumb enough to walk within 700 units of you. Like if you get ahead and you know what you're doing, in games where you carry as an ap support like annie or karma, expect your damage bar to be bigger than all 4 of your teammates combined (When my platinum friend played karma, with bronze me and my silver pals, he once did 3x as much damage to enemy champions as all of 4 of the rest of us combined, he was terrifying).\n\nI don't suggest tank support if you want to carry since tank supports rely on other people to be at least semi-competent but if you're good enough and your adc is not completely useless you could also carry it's just alot less reliable since you have trust other people to do damage. Braum is a bit better at surviving solo but you still rely on your adc alot, so it's not so great for carrying, I mean you can, it's just harder to force objectives and cement the win. If you do want to play a tank support at low elo, even though they're not all meta: blitzcrank, support mundo, nautilus, malphite and sion.\n\nHopefully you can climb to where you should be; goodluck friend, you'll need it.","replies":[]}]}
