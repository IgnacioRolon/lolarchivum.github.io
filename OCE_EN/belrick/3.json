A current trend i am witnessing is that jg who gank at lv2+ are winning far more often than losing.\r\n\r\nThis is because there is SO much gold/xp in the jg and in first towers that getting lanes ahead early snowballs super hard. OH and junglers are super strong with their base stats. \r\n\r\nThe only way a farming jg team can win (skill being equal) is if\r\na. their champs outscale hard AND\r\nb. the other team makes mistakes. (gets picked or stops pressuring lanes/objectives which delays the game)\r\n\r\nSo please junglers, don&#039;t be absent from the lanes. Make your presence known early and often.\r\nWhat if you are a sucky ganker without your ultimate? Stay NEAR lanes and be ready to counter-gank.\r\n\r\nIMHO junglers are either winning games or throwing them based on their play style in this current meta.\r\n\r\nPowering farming as a Jungler is a hope and pray tactic now.","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2017-01-17T00:45:21.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your right but for the wrong reasons.\n\n1. The reason's you have for a farming jungler winning, is actually just wrong, the reason a farming jungler wins is if the enemy team doesn't manage to snowball, and with how heavy of a snowball meta the current meta is, that is just super unlikely.\n2. \"what if your a bad ganker\", your reasoning for staying near lanes to counter gank just isn't helpful, if they are a 6 dependant jungler, even their counter ganks are bad before 6, and just so we are clear, amumu isn't a 6 dependant jungler as much as people say, a proper 6 dependant is malphite, and he has very little to bring to a counter gank.\n3. The whole thing about there being lots of gold/xp in jungle isn't really the case, and even if it was there is still enough time to manage ganks while keeping the jungle full cleared, just a lot of low elo junglers don't understand ganking paths.","replies":[{"poster":"Mortis Ex","date":"2017-01-18T04:31:00.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well not snowballing is related to making mistakes which is what OP said. And not punishing late scaling champs early is a mistake, exactly as OP said.\n Malph steals move speed, debuffs attack speed and has decent auto damage, WW is another champ that so many people say cant gank before 6 but he has move speed on low hp enemies and does a fair bit of damage with red autos and a Q, also buffing team mates att speed. If you dont know how to gank with a champion pre 6 then you probably shouldnt play that champ.  See people all the time picking a \"farm to 6 champ\" not ganking and hitting 6 well after everyone else. \nEven if they cannot do alot in a counter gank, simply having another person close can be the diff between them going deep for the kill or backing off and if the laner is too low to stay the jungler can then clear the wave under tower if its shoved in which is =/> to what they would norm get anyway and saves a bunch of tower damage. \nThose lvl 2-3 ganks are so annoying, when the jungler hits lvl 2 and ganks before you hit 2 can often give an enormous lead to the enemy but then knowing how to play safe and just get that xp and as much gold as you can safely and not tilting will often allow you to come back. \nMy last game was a perfect example of just stalling it out, Shaco vs Illaoi top, Illaoi perma shoved to my turret but i freeze pretty well with my boxes and ask nicely for ganks but my Rammus had decided I was a troll for picking Shaco and did nothing about an overpushed lane. I lost lane pretty badly to Ill but stayed low KD and kept up my CS to get items and late game I relentlessly split and caught up and we won after having an open nexus for over 15 mins.","replies":[]}]}]}
