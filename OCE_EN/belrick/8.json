If you don&#039;t trade you are losing lane. They hit you, hit em back or back to vs. bots.\r\n2. csing, when in doubt kill minions. Requires a last hitting skill set.\r\n3. Play around your cool downs. Used all your summoners and spells but trying to continue the fight? doing it wrong.\r\n4. If you lose the lane, it ain&#039;t your supports fault.\r\n5. Camped? Tis ok, means their jg or mid or top ain&#039;t in their own lane. Play safe, be cool, farm. take the blows.\r\n6. mindset is ALWAYS calculated aggression. Passive players need not apply as ADC\r\n7. LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION!\r\n8. Build to your opponents. If you cannot be flexible, you&#039;re going to have a hard time.\r\n9. Carry your support! Supports get ahead of the item curve off of assists... so kill! \r\n\r\nAhhh that is better, two terrible adc in a row... (both vs. terrible bot lane opponents too *facepalm*) just required ... off loading\r\n\r\nps: i love 0/7 laning phase top lane team mates, 1/8 mid lane viktors by 11min.

If you think ya can win a trade then go in proc your passive on generally the enemy adc and have your adc help stun them whilst you block the enemy support.

She carried the game because once we were out of laning phase, she went full beast mode. \n\n* I have had a kog'maw build the weirdest build ever and go 0/13 in the first 20 minutes, but we ended up winning because his build strangely worked really well and he ended the game something ridiculous like 24/14. \n\nAs a support main, you need to support your ADC. Adjust your play style to suit them, while still making the plays. Notice if they are passive or if they are aggressive and take it from there. If you try to force them to be something they aren't, it isn't going to go well. While the points on your list are pretty basic and valid, you have to remember: not everyone thinks the same as you and not everyone is going to play exactly the way you want. \n\n\n\n> i love 0/7 laning phase top lane team mates, 1/8 mid lane viktors by 11min.

Obviously a hyper carry is going to come back late game because they scale better i've had afew games playing vayne where i'd feed early then carry late. It has nothing to do with skill, I didn't win the game, the enemy lost it. \n\nWhat he's saying here is universal, all adcs should know how to farm, all adcs should know how to trade. If there's a blizcrank, then trade behind your minions so he can't pull you. It's not hard. Play the meta.\n\nMETA stands for most effective tatic available. And things are META, because they WORK. Regardless of peoples 'play style' that 'works' for them. There's a reason behind everything. \n\nWhy do you farm? To get gold. Why do you need gold? To buy items. Why do you itemise? To be able to handle the situation most effectively (Lots of burst ap? Maw. Lots of cc? Merc scim. Lost of ad burst? Steraks. Stacking hp? Lord dominiks/Botrk) there are items that are just better than others depending on your situation, regardless of how you 'feel' about them. This is a game of numbers, not emotions. What happens when you're items ahead of your opponent because you farmed better? You can trade better. What happens when you trade better? You can kill them. What happens when you kill them? You can take objectives and buy even more items so you can kill them again and rinse and repeat, or get so strong you dont even need to kill them to win. \n\nAnd as a support, you don't adjust your playstyle completely around them, you adjust it based on the whole game. If they have lots of ap, locket. Lots of cc, mikaels. Your champion has heals and shields and you're ahead, ardent. Their ad champs are fed? Randuins/deadmans/frozen heart. The list goes on. It's not a one way street. Bot lane is a 2v2 lane, so both players need to follow up on eachother in the METAs style. Whether or not these people know that is on them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Socon","date":"2016-07-24T15:54:01.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Before, you had to climb by being leagues above the one you're in, so you had to be a lot better to climb.
