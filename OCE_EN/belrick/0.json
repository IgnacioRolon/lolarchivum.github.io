With the shuffle in ranked queues and the global removal of Draft Pick it is highly unlikely this plan will go through. \n\nThere was also never a guarantee that NCS would take the same form replacing blind pick that it does for ranked queues, in fact from the sounds of the post the blind pick experience was never going to change (as NCS for blind would just make it draft) but rather just the visual experience, which is the current experience in the LCU.\n\nAs it is it's unsure whether OCE can support two ranked queues, hence the test in preseason, nevermind a second normal queue as well.\n\nWe may eventually get something like Draft Pick without bans (or Blind Pick with role allocation) to replace blind pick in the future though.\n\n(It's also worth noting that Dynamic Queue =/= New Champion Select, you are referring to NCS not dynamic queue which was a ranked specific thing.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2016-11-10T09:40:46.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Link plz?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rich3331","date":"2016-11-08T11:05:02.479+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"no idea why we dont have normal draft....
