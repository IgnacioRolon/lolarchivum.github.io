Maybe its a weekend thing? Or maybe rito seen my post? \n\nBut yeah you sum it up pretty well. It shouldn't be disabled cause of a handful of players have to wait longer to find a game. This was only a real problen when the server was new, OCE has a good amount of players now for a game in OCE. I was able to find games from 4 to 8 just fine. Queue time was only 1 and a half minutes longer than usual and it was k. I had fun and i didn't have to play unranked.","replies":[]}]}]}
