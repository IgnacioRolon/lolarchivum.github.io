You can bet up to 30 LP to get that much more back on top of your LP earnings if you win the match. If you lose, that 30 LP is gone, plus whatever you were going to lose due to losing anyway. It would put more on the line for a player and encourage them to play smarter if they&#039;ve put their money where there mouth is. This could also aid someone who is having a hot streak to climb a few rungs faster. **What do you guys think?**","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-25T05:41:17.959+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 problems are obvious.\n\n1. Queue sniping means win trading, meaning people climb for nothing.\n2. If i wanted to get to bronze 5 i could just by betting 30 LP and feeding.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-09-24T12:34:40.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it'd be cool but there are 2 problems I thought of instantly after reading the 1st line.\n\n1. Win trading: Friend on the enemy team? Tell them to put down an max bet and throw the game for them. Do it twice and they will be in promos.\n\n2. It takes away the whole point of a rating system. The points are supposed to represent your skill level, not whether or not you got lucky in a few games you put a bet on.\n\nAlso the system also takes into account people on \"hot-streaks\" by allowing you to skip whole divisions.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-24T14:14:40.799+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"and then you get them people who have plat mates and duo with them","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2015-09-25T02:19:18.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure if that'll work. People could probably abuse it and you'd never want to tell someone you've bet in case they bring their trolling wrath down upon you. You can't play smarter if you can't win at all.\n\nI'm thinking it would be cool if there was a more robust spectator system where the featured games had spectator chat and betting. Kind of like a cross between Smash 4's betting and a  Twitch chat.","replies":[]}]}
