VOIP has been out for a while now Riot...\r\n\r\n**On a sidenote:**\r\n In my opinion, it&#039;s pretty rich to offer a VOIP service to your LCS players while they&#039;re hitting the bigtime, but not have one embedded in the game that the rest of your community plays.\r\n\r\n**TL,DR: Bump if you want VOIP in-game. Also post your pros and cons in the comments.**","replies":[]}
