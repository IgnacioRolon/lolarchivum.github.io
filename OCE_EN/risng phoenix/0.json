I'm so used to my champ auto locking when the timer hits Zero before they changed it to you having to click lock in that I sometimes get a 5 minute ban once in a blue moon because I didn't hit the lock in button because I was changing my runes and summoner spells. Does anyone else have this problem or should I just get used to it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-04-10T10:23:31.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been like this for years now, and for a reason.\n\nHaving it this way ensures players are active and engaged throughout champion select. If you can't be passably present and attentive for the couple minutes that select takes, especially given the client comes forward and plays sounds when it's your turn to do things, why should your team trust you to be the same in-game?\n\nIt matters less in normals, but if it were in one mode and not the other, it would get confusing.","replies":[]}]}
