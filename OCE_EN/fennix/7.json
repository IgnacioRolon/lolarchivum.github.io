I do main ADC but I reckon I do pretty well as a mid laner too. \nMy average ADC scores are below.\nSivir: 191.5 cs 7.0/4.5/6.0 50% winrate\nCorki: 185.0 cs 11.7/6.5/8.2 50% winrate\nLucian: 144.4 cs 7.3/5.4/6.6 57% winrate\nTwitch 145.8 cs 8.0/4.5/11.0 100% winrate (played only twice in ranked)\n\nAnd you might be wondering why I cant get out of Bronze 5?\nIts because my mid lane scores are pretty good but I always lose.\nI also didn't write down any of the other ADC that I have a poor winrate on.\nAnyhow, I can play with you on Saturday, around 3-5pm. I have a pretty packed schedule now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frog Man","date":"2016-05-22T05:29:39.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Added you!
