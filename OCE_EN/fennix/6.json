(Sorry if this is the wrong place to put it)\r\n\r\nToday, a player by the name of Sneakyfranko added me, after we we&#039;re in a game together. During the game he was quite salty towards  me, and multiple times throughout the game he said he was going to report me. I don&#039;t have screenshots of the in-game messages, and I did not report him after the game, I figured it&#039;s just a troll and I&#039;d let it pass.\r\n\r\nHowever, things changed when added me and sent me these messages;\r\n\r\nhttps://gyazo.com/151fd9c8c882b37bf538053b40a71066\r\nhttps://gyazo.com/0919e9d66fbf9a911912f7c676c1359a\r\nhttps://gyazo.com/712cc054646e12ab38e65b278475e516\r\n\r\nThank you for your time, and I hope something can be done about this,\r\n-Fennix","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-01-13T18:26:21.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Fennix,\n\nSorry to hear someone is bothering you this way. You should use the report function so that if he acts like this to everyone he'll be more likely to receive punishment; muting is to stop someone from ruining *your* game, reporting is to stop them from ruining *future* games.\n\nThat said, friend requesting and harassing like this is completely unacceptable and is a quick way to receive an escalated punishment. If you need to report them, you'll want to submit a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with all the information you have, and it will be forwarded to a Player Behavior Specialist.\n\nDon't post the names on the boards though. It is considered \"Name & Shame\" and is against policy, and will only result in the thread being deleted. Board moderators are not Rioters, so have no power to take action against the person.\n\nIf you have problems with a troll from a recent match sending you friend requests, don't accept them. They usually just want to do this. Adding a player to your Block list prevents them from sending them.","replies":[{"poster":"Fennix","date":"2016-01-14T05:09:47.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Deep Terror Nami,\n\nSorry for posting it here, I was unaware of where to post it, and couldn't find anywhere on the website to report it.

It's better to just not reply if you can't do that, and taking the problem to other unconnected posts is just harassment, so please refrain from doing it. If he is harassing you, don't reply to him and just report the harassing comment.\n\nLooking at the conversation you two had it just looks like a misunderstanding and escalating it into a new problem. Just leave it at that and move on.","replies":[]}]}]}
