I am currently silver, hoping to reach Gold in pre season and then potentially Platnium by the end of Season 6.  I&#039;m looking for someone who is dedicated to climbing, likes to have a laugh but is serious when playing. I main ADC but can comfortably play Support and Top. A support or Jungle duo would be nice, but any role is fine.
