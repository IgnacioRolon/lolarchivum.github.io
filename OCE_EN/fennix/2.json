I am currently in my promos for silver, I only need one more win. I&#039;m looking for someone who is dedicated to climbing, likes to have a laugh but is serious when playing. I main ADC but can comfortably play Support and Top. A support or Jungle duo would be nice, but any role is fine. Comment below or add me in game if you&#039;re interested.\r\n\r\nTop- {{champion:150}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:2}} \r\nJungle- {{champion:64}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:107}} \r\nMid- {{champion:238}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:157}} \r\nADC- {{champion:222}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:429}} \r\nSupport- {{champion:12}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:412}}","replies":[]}
