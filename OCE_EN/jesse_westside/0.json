When I go to click on the minimised tab it doesn&#039;t bring the game back up at all, it just flickers. Now while not playing has been pretty beneficial to my academic year, I&#039;m pretty bored these holidays and want to try get back into it. I&#039;ve tried getting a few mates to fix it, but seem to be overlooking the problem. Anyone have any idea what could be the issue? I have Norton internet security, which has been suggested to be the cause, but I didn&#039;t have any problems before, and all the League affiliated programs are allowed through firewall and the like.","replies":[]}
