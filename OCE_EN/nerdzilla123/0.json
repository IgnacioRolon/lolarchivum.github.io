Even if they killed Yasuo's master to stop others from learning technique, they would still have to go after Yasuo as he would be able to teach someone else, and again very difficult to learn and use the wind technique.\n\nKennen does however serve Ionia, and is possible that he could be helping to catch Yasuo along with everyone from Yasuo's old home.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-11-06T12:16:19.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"assassin: bye trade\ntrade: bye assassin","replies":[]},{"poster":"Buttsubushi","date":"2015-11-06T11:51:59.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont think that Kennen would kill someone like Yasuo's master unless the master was connected something bigger, like secretly being one of Zed's followers. The most concrete theory is that it wasn't Riven, but someone who was trained by and with the same techniques that Riven was.","replies":[]}]}
