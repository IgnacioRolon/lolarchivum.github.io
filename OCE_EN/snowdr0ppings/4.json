Also if you like to split your boxes between blue and gromp, place 2 at gromp, or else by the time u are finished gromp with 1 box the 2nd box you placed will have despawned.","replies":[{"poster":"Snowdr0ppings","date":"2015-03-16T05:02:28.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks i just tryed that it worked well","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Snowdr0ppings","date":"2015-03-16T01:36:25.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i forgot to put the other play styles at top, mid, and bot (he is not a adc he is a supp do not ask why please)\n\n*Shaco mid - stay at tower farming minions put boxes at the river's entries/exits to counter ganks\n\n*Shaco top - push and put boxes in triangals behind your minions that way if some one runs into it 1 box fears into the other fearing into the 3rd (really good in Hybrid)\n\n*Shaco bot - put W in bushes and use it as a meat sheild for pulls from thresh and blitz cause it can take skill shots and basic attacks before it goes invis, when they go to gank u when u have boxes in the river u know when they r coming (scuddle crab sets off the box so take scudde while u r there for dragon and river control) the boxes in the bushes at bot they can not sit in there. in total he does not need to buy a ton of wards or even get a sightstone {{champion:35}}","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-03-16T02:52:07.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meh I like shaco where you can easily kill anyone squishy, but can still take quite a few hits","replies":[]}]}]}
