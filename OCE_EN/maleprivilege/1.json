Getting a group of mates together is the best option IMO. \n\nI haven't played in 6 years hence the new account, so many items were removed/added and champions reworked or changed that it is basically a different game. I have a good grasp on most, if not all of that stuff, however, it isn't like I am a returning champion. \n\nSo there is a lot a ranked person could teach me that I would appreciate and a lot of bronzies that ranked individual could enjoy smashing whilst doing so, then hopefully the climb shall begin. \n\nP.S The name MalePrivilege is a joke between my partner and I, my partner took FemalePrivilege so that when we team up we can finally see Male and Female privilege working together, despite MalePrivilege being a myth :^)","replies":[]}
