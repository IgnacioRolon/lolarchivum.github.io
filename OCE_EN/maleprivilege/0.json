I am not a tank main so I can&#039;t confirm, however, I do see a lot of players grabbing around 3 or 4 anti-armour items for a final build such as Boots-Duskblade-Youmuus-BT-PD and they finish with lord doms or IE some people have even throw a Black cleaver in there just because. These players do a TON of damage to people regardless of their status of being a tank with full build or a squishy assassin and I was wondering as a returning player if this is intentional? I kind of feel disheartened when I see a tank get 2 shotted by an assassin, that tank has one job and he cant do it. That assassin has one job and he does it too well. Are the tanks I am being grouped with just that bad and the assassins just that good or is there a balance issue? I am also seeing those same tanks that get two shotted deal a lot of damage and have had games myself where I end out solo carrying my team as garen or mundo dealing all of the damage whilst building mostly tank whilst the rest of my team have a solid 2 kills and 8 deaths each, unsure if it is the low elo or if tanks have an odd damage-armour-health ratio at the moment, or if it is the items or maybe even the other champs taking too much damage? A fair amount of questions as it has been over 5 years, a lot has been fixed (such as that cancerous ap yi thank christ) thanks in advance! Keep the chat friendly please, I am not harming anyone by asking.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-03-31T11:28:17.283+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Before i get into the post i just want to point out that the 'enter' key on your keyboard allows you to space out your thoughts in a more digestible manner. That said..\n\nI think lethality items are in a good spot after the duskblade change (i wont say nerf because it was buffed in another way). Also note that lethality was designed to be less snowbally than armour pen used to be. Since you didn't point out WHO you mean specifically im going to assume you're complaing about AD assasins such as Zed, Kha'Zix, Rengar and Talon, with the occasional quinn and lethality mf. \n\nThese champions are difficult to get ahead with when you are playing against someone of equal skill to you. When they do get ahead however it is very easy to start bursting anyone on the team, including tanks who i am assuming haven't built many tank items are lower level. Remember that these champions are designed to KILL, and that includes tanks, and the method of killing is in bursts. Meaning when their burst is over, you can easily shut them down. Tanks should be able to take the brunt of their force, but if there is no one to punish an assassin for wasting their burst on a tank, their skills will come off cooldown and the cycle will continue. \n\nTaking a full build ad assassin and a tank with at least a ninja tabi, thornmail, and one other heath/armour item (like randuins) on equal level, that tank will be able to survive the assasins full burst (Also depending on the assassin, i would be thinking of a talon). If the tank survives the burst, then your team has a huge advantage in team fights. It is a team effort, its not that the tanks are bad, but maybe as a team you are not working together well enough to punish assassins for using their abilities on a tank. Of course you also have other members of the enemy team to worry about too, but if everyone does what they should be doing you will always have counterplay options. \n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that allowing these types of items to exists allows for full AD comps to not be so terrible while still being punishable during the late game.","replies":[{"poster":"MalePrivilege","date":"2018-04-01T02:39:46.508+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You hit the nail on the head with the champions I was speaking of, I didn't name and shame because of how easy it seems to be to trigger people that like those champions. It is very hard to get my team to work with me even for a seemingly obvious objective such as the enemy inhib is open (turret is down) and we win team fights but not under towers, so I suggest team fighting the inhib for another advantage to take mid, nobody says anything and continues to tower dive mid for kill for kill trade-offs.\n\nIll have to do more digging as to how the lethality works, I had just assumed it was basic armour penetration as to how it use to work and that had me worried, but it seems it isn't as bad. Thanks for all of that, I have learned a lot of what I have missed!","replies":[]}]}]}
