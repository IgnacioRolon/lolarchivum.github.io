If we kept both, we would have to allocate 2 teams to support both which ultimately would occupy resources better used somewhere else. Also Air has so many issues and limitations that would mean some features would not be possible to be deployed and would make players and developers life a nightmare.\n\nHope you can understand and hope you (and) we will get used to this one.\n\nMM","replies":[{"poster":"Project Fizz","date":"2016-11-11T11:33:17.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am keeping an open mind as it is only open beta.

Think of it like having two \"duo lanes\" in a \"standard\" game. This basically means you'd be sacrificing significant power from another position (probably Jungle) *just* to keep your \"secondary\" duo lane \"at pace\" with their lane opponent and the enemy position that your team lacks. It's extremely problematic and is effectively a waste of perfectly good resources, which is why you rarely (if *ever*) see it actually happen, even in \"screw around\" games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-11-11T11:31:57.011+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Another day on the boards, another day of stupid ideas {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]}]}
