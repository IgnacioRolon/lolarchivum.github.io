The afk warning didn&#039;t even come up at all, however I still got punished? Minions had only just spawned when I got back as well. I know you shouldn&#039;t afk but where was my warning on screen? The last time I got low priority was 3 months ago and I got multiple warnings of being afk, however this time I didn&#039;t get a single warning, not even a warning on screen.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-11-23T05:32:26.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">when I came back 2 minutes later my team was mentioning remaking which I said no I'm back I was just going toilet.\n\nYou mean the actual remake in your history?\n\nWhere you have no items.\n\nSeems to me like you were afk for more than 2 minutes.","replies":[]}]}
