When you say it works on other PCS - are they also using the same internet connection (eg. someone else's PC in your family)?\n\nLet me know how you go.","replies":[{"poster":"xXAussieDonXx","date":"2015-10-15T08:48:13.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive been though all the forums tried everything they say.\njust wont load... and no its on different pc's with different ISP...\njust wondering if theres maybe some software needed....

The suggestions in the article cover most common scenarios and it sounds like you've done a lot to try and get it working. You shouldn't need Pando anymore as that is no longer used by the client (we actually recommend people uninstall it these days), and even so that is a technology that affects patching, rather than the store itself.\n\nI'd strongly suggest that as a next step you get in touch with player support (see support link at top of page) and open a ticket with them.  They'll be able to help you troubleshoot it further, and will  be able to go through relevant logs and PC settings.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"xXAussieDonXx","date":"2015-10-15T01:54:24.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can access store on other pcs.
