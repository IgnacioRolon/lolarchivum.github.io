WTF has happened to item sets?","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"This game seems to be worse in every way than when i left ~2 years ago.\n \nTeemos shrooms now disappear within a couple of minutes? WTF is that? If a Teemo invests his time in building up a critical mass in a certain area, its an investment which should atleast stand a chance of being rewarded. If in the enemy jungle, for one, it is super dangerous and the shrooms can be detected and deleted with various things these days anyway. Also Teemo isn&#039;t contributing while he is doing it so it is a legitimate gamble. Why have this ridiculous short timer? Its just another unique champion who offered a very different and interesting playstyle, that you have ruined in your quest to homogenize everything.\n\nThe same can be said for items. No longer do you have Zephyr or powerful, distinct items that offer diverging play styles.. EVERYTHING is split so if you want to have any decent movespeed you have to buy atleast 3x 5-7% movespeed items. Likewise for critical strike, armour pen, even AD and AP, armour and magic resist. Practically every build is the same because everything is designed to only offer a fraction of what you want, necessitating that you buy 3 or 4 items to just have a significant amount of one stat. How many items give a little attack speed, a little AD, a little crit strike? Loads, so if you want to make a basic build, you are forced to buy all of these items, guaranteeing that your build will turn out just like everyone elses.\n\nWhat the hell happened to spell vamp? WTF is your logic in this? Again, homogenization. You are reducing the number of viable build paths and play styles and this makes the game bland and samey.\n\nITEMS SETS??! Seriously? Why remove a function you already created? I used this for EVERY character. Even if i wasn't building a specific set, i would collect all of the items that i might possibly find useful for a certain hero, so they are easy to access ingame.. Now i have to go to a freaking website to try and figure out interesting builds (although there really aren't any, anymore) for different heroes, and alt-tab out to remind myself of them, ingame. WTF are you doing??\n\nSeriously. Can we revert this game to how it was 2-3 years ago? All you've done is ruin things.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-02-27T06:46:42.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Item set is still there on the legacy client, but it hasn't been made available in the new client just yet afaik.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-02-27T04:33:51.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they removed zephyr, huh, didnt even notice, also, item sets are still working, for me at least","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2017-02-25T00:51:18.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i do miss zephyr","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-02-24T23:15:12.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's probably worth to just leave league for good then","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-02-24T22:51:26.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They made it 5 min, but they also made place distance massive as all hell and they do a lot more damage\n\nItem sets are still on the legacy client.\n\nYOU CAN GET FREE SKINS NOW.\n\nAnd spellvamp was turned into omnivamp, exact same thing, but heals from pets and auto attacks on top of spells.","replies":[]}]}
