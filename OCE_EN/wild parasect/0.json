I feel like whenever I play support, I have a lack of gold and experience, making me useless to the team and unable to affect anything. How do I stay ahead, and how do I become useful to my team? Any feedback is useful, I just want to hear what people think. \r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2014-12-05T05:01:59.796+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The real trick with support is that you should keep in mind your relative level of power during the game. In the early stages, you're generally going to be one of (if not the) strongest champions on your team. Early on in bottom lane, the supports have more impact in trading relative to the ADC. The trick is using that power to keep your ADC safe, and make the life of the enemy ADC more annoying. Being annoying to the enemy ADC is my favourite part of supporting! \n\nGenerally, after that point, the key is focusing on how your champion provides utility to your team, rather than brute force. For example, although Morgana can do a lot of damage with her ultimate, you're going to want to generally focus on how you can mitigate CC on your carries while catching someone out of position with a 3 second binding, and then forcing a disengage with your ult when an enemy tries to burst a squishy. \n\nIt's also hard to underrate the value of having vision in any specific situation is. When your team is pushing up, you're able to prevent the enemy team from pincering you by using wards well. You can also find the enemy jungler with a ward during the laning phases which allows other lanes to over-extend safely. Make sure to grab pinks on top of your sighstone!\n\nAll that said, if you're ahead, once you have your core support items (Sightstone, Support Gold item upgrade, boots) - it's not the worst thing to build damage if that's something your champion can bring to your team (especially Morgana (Zhonyas) / Karma or Zyra (Liandry's)) without putting yourself at risk.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheTourist","date":"2014-12-05T05:17:46.514+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lane presence: stay in front of your adc always taking advantage of being able to poke while not exposing yourself to much. If you're able to sustain your poke try to zone them away from the gold/exp. Also use smart cast if you're not already. This will help you setup quick grabs and snares. Try not to leave your adc by himself in lane phase. I always back when he backs cause it wouldn't hurt to pick up a ward or refresh sightstone. \n\nWarding: always maintain your wards. Generally 1 in front of dragon, bottom wall bush depending on how pushed you are and one in tribush. If on other side you can pink tribush and wars dragon and both side bushes. Depending on match up you can keep ward trinket to upgrade into pink for invisible champs like vayne /talon/wukong. Or sweeper if jungle isn't going that route. Learn the spots where you can land wards over walls successfully. \n\nTeamfights: try to remember to always use your summoners. Always exhaust the ADC or next in line damage. Also try to remember when their supports summoners will be up so you know if it's possible to engage and win. Peel for your adc and midlaner. If you gotta peel to the result of your death but saved your team so be it. You might have saved the game. \n\nItems: always make sure you remember to use your active items. FOTM is a life saver and coin is a great engager/disengage. Also depending on your mouse for me I set keybind 7 to mouse button 4. put your sightstone on 7. So my fingers are always ready to go without fumbling to ward. Also helps me do faster lee sin ward jumps. \n\nThat's basically it really. The rest is up to you and playing multiple games to learn. Last but not least learn what supports compliment your more importantly your adc.","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2014-12-05T05:35:53.931+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Items: always make sure you remember to use your active items.

I tend to use the other buttons on my mouse, but making sure these actives are easy to use will help you to make sure you use them - this is really important for supports more than other roles, because they can easily end up with 3+ activatable items!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JoashT","date":"2014-12-07T14:42:58.655+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Didn't know Support Mains would give such a long and detailed guide.**\n\nI main support and I'll share with you what I've learnt in the past year that I've been playing LoL \n\nThe first thing, is to (ALWAYS) be patient with the your adc ( whether their feeding on accident, feeding on purpose, or just bad ). Just put up with him/her. If your adc is harassing, or blaming you, don't argue back, as it's pointless. Just mute or ignore. \n\nAnother thing I've learnt is: Lets say the \"hookers\" like {{champion:53}} {{champion:412}} or any support with any potential stuns or anything, when they miss their main ability, like blitzs is \"rocket grab\" straight away engage on their adc (or whoever that does more damage or whoever that is squishier). But you've also got to look at the situation before engaging though.\n\nBefore poking or engaging, make sure that they do not have a cannon minion (early game) or a big wave of minions. Because, if you poke one of them, under their wave, they'll all focus you and you'll take a lot of dps. \n\nMake sure, to also check your ally's health and yours too, before engaging. And 1 more thing. In a fight if you're dying, go in a bush even if it burns your flash or anything{{summoner:4}} as that would make them lose vision of you (provided that bush, that the bush is not warded by them) and (maybe) make them panic and give your adc some time to shoot or run. Do not risk life your to grant vision to your team it's not worth it, and if you know enemies are MIA do not go out alone to ward. \n\nPut your ADC over you ( even if it takes your life). Don't engage if you know they'll out damage you and your adc. don't get too greedy for poke (Example. Under turrent and you are poking your enemy. Enemy comes in and grabs you in gg). In a fight stand in front of your adc (Braum's a good example). To prevent CC like Ashe' ult from hitting your adc.\n\nWork out how both of you are going to play (aggressive, passive, or situational) because if you don't, It could sometimes lead to frequent deaths.\nDon't get too overconfident and forget to ward. Ward only crucial areas as you are limited to 3. Vision wards (I suggest to place it somewhere in the jungle to keep you jungle safe). \n\nExhaust {{summoner:3}} on the target that DEALS More DAMAGE, or to slow. But normally you would want to use it to lessen their damage dealt to you or your adc. Champions I would recommend are thresh{{champion:412}}  (it might take a while to get used to). \n\nCoordination is the key to winning the bot lane. And remember. if both of you are low just recall. DO NOT stay, to try and protect the turrent. Because if the enemy succeeds in tower diving (kills both of you), they'll also be able to take the turrent, resulting in a 2 kills + 1 turrent for them. \n\n\n**P.M me is you need any more help. Sorry for my bad English. And sorry for long guide.**\n\n\n1. I started out playing support, as nunu{{champion:20}} \n2. And then I saw Xpecial with that janna play so i started playing her{{champion:40}} \n3. Then I bought taric after seeing a really good one {{champion:44}} \n4. I moved to alistar {{champion:12}} because he looked really tanky and fun. But not long after I went back to playing (maining) Taric.\n5. After like one season, i got bored of taric. So i started playing Leona {{champion:89}} as I saw many pro players using her\n6. I bought Thresh{{champion:412}}  (but I didn't use him)\n7. Then I bought nami {{champion:267}} (many used it in worlds)\n8. I went back to Thresh{{champion:412}}  and kept playing him non-stop.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MouseDestruction","date":"2014-12-07T10:55:04.477+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love to watch the pro games and look for new ideas. Trying a new champ? look a guide up on Youtube (its a lot better than reading one). Duo'ing with someone who plays support is also a good idea. I've learnt a lot from my friendly duo's probably because you friend the guy who carried you not the one who fed :P\n\nP.S starting with a tanky support can be a good idea cause you dont die instantly if adc catch you.

Leona, Annie, Sona, Alistar. For these guys standing forward is a must.\n* Counter Engage: secondary style of cc, usually has a notable cast time however great followup or disengage. eg, Nami, Braum, Zyra, Janna, Morgana. For this style of support standing near your carries to protect them is best.\n\nIn lane, always try to hold the line with your ADC, that is to keep yourself in line with them. Never stand way back of far forward compared to your ADC, as you are basically causing a 2v1 as one of you will be unable to join a fight in time.\n\nIn lane, typically Poke supports do well against all in supports as you will be able to poke them down before they can engage. Sustain supports typically do well against poke supports it can undo the poke. and All in supports do well vs sustain supports as they can only heal small amounts and cant handle larger trades.\n\nIf you have a situation where your ADC has to recall and you are near full hp/mana, roam to help mid or ask your jungler to help you ward the enemy jungle.\n\nAs for gold shortage, rushing {{item:2049}} {{item:3117}} and {{item:3364}} are essential. Getting the second tier of gold gen item can help as well. {{item:3301}} line of gold generation items is always easy gold gen, and the talisman is very powerful, but the lack of combat stats can hurt if you are a tanky support. Aiming to get a {{item:3341}} and on your first back, so it can be used at 9 for the oracles upgrade is valuable. Vision wards are also essential\n\nWhile warding is important, its not the job of the support alone, its the job of EVERYONE on the team.\n\nwith Morgana support, make sure you get black shield before the lane opponent will likely all in. IE. lvl 1 vs {{champion:201}}, lvl 2 vs {{champion:89}}  as it can single handedly win the trade.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geldour","date":"2014-12-05T04:08:30.484+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ward more\ndie less\ndie more ( to save team mates ) 90% of your deaths should be to save someone\nward more again\ntrack buffs, drag, baron, ward them, ping them when they come up\nif jungler is not taking all the jungle, take your adc to get it ( the close one only)\nward more again\nplay INFRONT of your adc. not behind.\nward more, why do you not have a pink on the map>? buy another. \nping mia for ALL LANES not just bot.
