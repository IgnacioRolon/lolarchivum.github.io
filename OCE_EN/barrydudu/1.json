First time to write things on the board hope any of your staff will read this and comment.\r\n \r\nI would like to talk about the current game play experience most likely about the team strategys, the first thing I want to talk about is the TP time, since mid of last year you guys change the TP time , TP is not really useful as before, the point of view for me LOL is a team game if we focus on the lane not much the other team mate can do about except jungle. I might can&#039;t tell any solutions but I want to share my game experience. \r\n\r\nFor the reason I like LOL is because is a team game, but since you guys changed quite a lot of things to reduce the early game supporting from the other lane, the game becoming to a bit of not many other ways expect facing lane. The strategy become simple, team game should require more strategies then a Presonal skills (of course is important too), I understand you guys might want the game time getting shorter, but if a team game lost their strategies, it also lost main theme for playing as a team. \r\n\r\nNow for me LOL still the best game ever, I am thinking maybe we can do something more in the jungle or maybe we might can have couple of extra ban places , extra maps also can increase the fun and strategies(something like Starcraft, player choose different maps to maximum their strategies in game) all these could creat more strategies during the gaming time.\r\n\r\nHope all the summoners can reach whatever the rank they want and love this game as long as we can.\r\n\r\nLast hope any riot staffs can read this.\r\nBit early but Marry Christmas for you all!","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-12-08T04:48:23.152+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the kind words!\n\nWe definitely want to keep League of Legends as a team game. The thing with teleport was that it was TOO powerful before.

Secondly, I agree that they shouldn't of reduced the cd of TP, because now that there is a constant meta, team fights early-game are less common. I'd like to think that if TP were on a shorter cooldown more top-laners would use it and there would be more potential for early-game coordination at either jungle, bot or mid-lane. It would make the early few minutes swap out personal skill at farming/trading for a bit more team-fights (still unsure about this point). Thirdly, META!!! Meta is one of the things that has changed the game to separate itself from other MOBA's, however I do not agree that it should be fair for someone like me for example to play one for all and have to 2v1 top for 14 minutes simply because everyone is used to meta when in fact they are 'rooting' them-self to the same style of gameplay every game they play; we have a jungler. So put it simply, I agree that there should be a new map that doesn't include lanes and therefore won't have a meta (I hope) this will mean that people will be free to try out a compilation of champions to try out team fights with and not be restricted to either the same style meta play or choose to be flamed at by your team if your non-meta pick doesn't work. I personally loved going into champion select 2 years ago and my friend and I would both call 'roam' and just pick alistar and blitzcrank, these were when the game was exploring its potential with champion picks and combo's and it sadly doesn't get enough appreciation these days. \n\nMy rant was unclear\n1. I like League of Legends\n2. Reduce the cd of TP and there could more team fights early rather than everyone only farming\n3. Meta causes the game to not change the way it used to and leaves it un-enjoyable for some people, this could be solved by adding a map for moshpits (not howling abyss) that have no minions or lanes, which allows team fights to occur only\n4. My friend and I did random stuff and people were cool with it, but now it will be considered as trolling, unsportsmanlike conduct or non-communication.","replies":[]}]}
