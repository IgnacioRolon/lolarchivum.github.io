Not very long, I know - and judging from the fact that I&#039;m Bronze 3 and failed two of my promos today, making 3 in total, I&#039;m probably not very good at it either (To be fair, troll picks. Everywhere). But I play it all the same and enjoy it for the most part. I wanted to talk to you about a champion I bought recently for 4800 IP named Yorick. You probably haven&#039;t heard of him. Oh wait, sorry. Maybe you have, but...have you seen him? Probably not. I never see anybody play Yorick, and I played a game with him recently and my interest has been captivated by this champion because honestly, he&#039;s not that bad. But I do think that he needs a few changes, at least to make him relevant again, and worth playing. These are just suggestions and ideas, but for a 4800 champion in a Top-Lane meta where Darius and Garen broken are banned almost every ranked game, (at least for us &quot;Bronzies&quot;)) I think he could do a bit better. I want to start with my first suggestion:\n\n* **His Ghouls can take damage? But they only last for five seconds anyways...**\nHis Ghouls die so easily, and while they do reasonable amounts of damage and burst, it kind of really sucks. They only last for five and ten seconds respectively anyways, so why not make it so that they can&#039;t take any damage from outside sources except maybe turrets or something? That&#039;d make them a lot more relevant, if you ask me. At the very least, I think they could use with a health buff if because Yorick (or anyone he ults) takes 1,000,000 damage when he dies the second time after being ulted. {{item:3070}} \n\n* **Why not make all his Ghouls scale with AD?**\nI&#039;m talking to you, green guy. Yorick&#039;s W is the only one that deals basically no damage because it scales with AP upon activation. His E and Q both deal great amount of damage, so if you gave it the same ratios as his E, that&#039;d make it a lot better. And the reason why I think this needs to change is because unless you&#039;re going full AP Yorick (which I haven&#039;t tried yet, sounds like an adventure) the only item you&#039;d build which would actually give you any AP would be Trinity Force...and you don&#039;t build Tri Force just for the AP. His W is the one I (try) to use to clear waves, considering it has an AoE and whatnot, but considering Darius can do that with a single Q at level 6-7, it kind of fails in comparison - just making it deal AD would make it a lot more useful for clearing, which isn&#039;t the end of the world with champions who can do it far easier than Yorick can, and are far more &quot;balanced&quot; (broken) than Yorick is. I also use it when attacking towers because it&#039;s the only one you can summon without needing to target or hit a living thing, which brings me to my next point. {{champion:92}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:5}} \n\n* **You could make it so that his Ghouls can be casted upon structures.**\nI don&#039;t really see why that would be the end of the world either. Give him some more ability to push lanes, make him useful! (More useful than he already is?) Garen can Q towers, RIOT, it&#039;s just not fair. They don&#039;t even need to deal the activation damage, but being able to get all his abilities attacking tower at once would actually make him threatening within reason.\n\n* **His Ghouls have...questionable AI.**\nThis is the main reason why I requested they at least can&#039;t take damage from outside sources that aren&#039;t towers or whatever. His Ghouls already only last for five seconds, which is a pretty short time considering they take damage from whatever they&#039;re attacking and such, but I noticed that when I activated my Q there was a Ghoul which stood there for about two seconds before it went, &quot;Oh, damn, I&#039;m supposed to be at work!&quot; and then it ran to the minion wave, hit something twice, and died. Look, I&#039;m no game/champion designer, I don&#039;t work at RIOT (obviously, but you can hire me if you want ;3) and I don&#039;t know code, or I&#039;m not particularly good at Math so I can&#039;t tell you the exact algorithm that makes his Ghouls have AI deficiencies  but it&#039;s just something I noticed, could maybe use a bit of work or something. RIOT probably won&#039;t even see this, so it kind of feels like I&#039;m alone on that one. And this entire post, actually. Call me.\n\n* **The unreasonable bit.**\nThis is the most unreasonable of my asks, and I&#039;m not really all for it - it&#039;s not a prioritized change, but more of a &quot;What if&quot;. Yorick&#039;s ult is currently pretty meh. I don&#039;t really have too many hard feelings for it one way or another, but what if you could use it on other people, and it summoned a revenant of them with their stats which did damage and other cool things like that, but if they died while it was active, they actually get brought back to life in the same way Yorick&#039;s allies do, and they can attack your team and stuff for a bit. Could be interesting, but it doesn&#039;t stop there - because I have more things to explore in regards to Yorick&#039;s ult and I want to put them all in one post. Yorick&#039;s pretty metal, he&#039;s even got a skin for it, and likes him some death, so what if you could ult dead allies to bring them back to life if they were dead within five seconds of their revival timer - or, furthermore, if you could ult yourself while you were dead. I could understand how that could be kind of messed up, particularly earlier on in games, but hey, just another idea, a suggestion, probably won&#039;t ever be seen. Ever. \n\n* ** Since you like them so much...**\nI know I said my last post was the most unreasonable one, but it&#039;s 3:32 AM and I just thought of one which might top that: when I played Yorick, I had no idea what role he was. He didn&#039;t seem too good at pushing, or team fights, or 1v1s or...anything, really and my guides/recommended section didn&#039;t really tell me to build tank (but if you have any suggestions on builds feel free to respond to this in the comments, tell me something cool to do on him). So, why not make him a Juggernaut? You guys give Darius and Garen all the love - why not Yorick? \n\n* ** Another slightly unreasonable one which I though of at 3:35 AM :&gt;**\nYou could maybe make it so that his E gives him a bit of mana back as well. Obviously, if it gave back as much as it did mana, that would be insane, but I play a lot of Cassiopeia and if she can get mana back from killing things (stacked with Tear, which Yorick is told to build) I think it&#039;d be another step towards making Yorick more competent.\n\nThank you for reading my Yorick demands, if you read my Yorick demands. If you didn&#039;t, I&#039;ll be working on my Amumu cosplay, and my post about all the changes Urgot should receive. I&#039;m just kidding, I might not ever touch this forum again - and yes, I was serious about wanting to be hired if for some forsaken reason RIOT reads this and goes &quot;Hey, this guy has some pretty good ideas.&quot;\n\nWith love,\n _Disturbed Deity_","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-09-26T06:33:46.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't even know who you have been playing, his ghouls do alot of damage in the time they last, he is legit just build, {{item:3043}}  and {{item:3078}}  full tank, and no one can do anything, he had 95% lane winrate (not so much for game), he melts towers for fun (those ghouls will attack towers if you kill the minion they are hitting) he never runs out of hp, unless someone I extremely fed, he is really bad, or its a gangbang. He has 2 lives. There is nearly no way to lose as yorick in a 1v1 lane. Thus the rework.\n\nAnd actually all his ghouls scale ad, only 2 had ad on summon, but they all scale with 35%+ ad\n\nRework because, he rarely loses lane, but he rarely wins game, riot doesn't want someone only useful for laning, similar to poppy, she can kill enemy carry without a care in the world because of her ult.","replies":[{"poster":"KidConfucius","date":"2015-09-27T07:17:22.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He definitely isnt as unbeatable / un-counterable as he used to be. His ghouls are his power , without them present his damage output drops significantly , and there are many champions that can outright ignore them or destroy yorick in lane without much problem at all.  \n\nFor example Garen easy walks all over yorick. His short speed boost + silence lets him get in yoricks face without any real counter from yorick. Silence is the worst thing that can happen to him. The ghouls wont survive garens spin long enough to be of any use after the silence. And yorick at the very least needs a tear before he has any real sustain , while garen's passive healing is way over the top , only has to sit at his tower for 8-10 sec an he will have healed the majority of his hp back.  \n\nSimilar results would come from facing a darius. His high damage abilities will easily clear the waves and yoricks ghouls , and there really isnt anyone who can actually stand toe to toe with darius and trade with him and his passive.  Cho gath is the same , and can easily dismiss yorick. The AOE spikes from his aa's can shred the ghouls down before they reach him, his passive + dorans ring will keep him in lane longer then yorick early game , and his burst and cc will easy win any all in trades from yorick. His large aoe silence again gives him plenty of breathing room to deal with yorick , and just like garen and darius he has a high burst single target ult , he only needs to get you down to around half hp and your finished , even if your winning the trade an they are nearly dead , you cant win the fight before they burst you down.\n\n\nYorick has no real burst and relies on all in to win trades , and unless someone has over-committed they are just going to escape fairly easily . He needs something more concrete then just a little slow , and his ghouls should really not decay on their own. Other then ulting his carry late game he really has no solid and noticeable impact outside lane phase.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Disturbed Deity","date":"2015-09-26T08:11:22.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I said, I only got to play him once and the guide I was reading didn't tell me to build Tri Force, but thank you for your advice and I'll be sure to try it out.
