They're the ones that will boost/drop your mmr the most so if you go 5-5 and win all first 5 it's really likely that you'll be placed an entire league higher than if you went 5-5 and won the last 5.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-12-08T06:46:48.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"did you not read what i said?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaledot","date":"2016-12-08T05:30:40.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sure that it depends on how you went last season.
