Here&#039;s the chat log.\n\nGame 1\nHawaii Fruit Tea: WTF\nHawaii Fruit Tea: im lagging\nHawaii Fruit Tea: stop\nHawaii Fruit Tea: why\nHawaii Fruit Tea: i see how you wanna play daddy\nHawaii Fruit Tea: i&#039;ll play with you\nHawaii Fruit Tea: wo cao ni ma\nHawaii Fruit Tea: bi xue\nHawaii Fruit Tea: sorry dude\nHawaii Fruit Tea: you literally cannot win\nHawaii Fruit Tea: do it for your nakama\nHawaii Fruit Tea: good job dude!\nHawaii Fruit Tea: you did it\nHawaii Fruit Tea: ching ch0ng ching ch0ng\nHawaii Fruit Tea: okay poopoo face u succc\nHawaii Fruit Tea: you killed my nakama\nHawaii Fruit Tea: you will pay for your sins\nHawaii Fruit Tea: im lagging\n\nThe first 5 sentences, is in reply to a Master Yi attacking me while I was getting some mad packet loss. \n\nI understand, the chinese language racist insults- but i&#039;m asian as well. They were spamming the entire game with foreign languages, and just trolling.\n\nEvery other comment, was clearly positive / roleplay, or miscellaneous.\nExamples of positive attitude can be shown, in comments such as &#039;good job dude!&#039; / &#039;you did it&#039;.\n\nThe following negative comments commenced when the other two, obviously chinese players came top and tried to communicate via their own language.\n\nSorry for being negative on 2 - 4 occasions. But deadass, i called someone a poopoo face and gave em a one-succ meme.\n\nThanks for hearing me out, i&#039;m down with the results either way. Thanks. \n\nP.S this was the only chat log available.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-12-01T13:23:41.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being asian doesn't change the fact you were insulting them, nor does it make the use of language like \"ching ch0ng\" anymore ok. Racism is taken very seriously, and will often escalate straight to a 14 day ban, skipping any chat restrictions.\n\nPlease be aware that the next punishment tier is permanent suspension of your account. If you continue with racist remarks like this you will quickly see your account permanently banned.","replies":[]}]}
