When tried updating it, however after the download it said something was wrong. I decided to delete league and re-download it. Unfortunately, league will not download completely for me. After opening it in applications and downloading this first part there are not issues. The issue arises when i try open client. When i click on the league of legends folder thingy the icon appears slightly in the toolbar...bounces a couple times then disappears.... Another help would be really appreciated. Thank you. Sorry for the bad English.","replies":[{"poster":"LordOverAll","date":"2017-12-08T01:29:13.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is happening to me as well but i have a pc so i don't really care. feels bad man","replies":[]}]}
