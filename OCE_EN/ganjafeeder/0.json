As such, you’ll want to direct this to Riot Games Player Support by [**submitting a ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us)! As you submit your request, here are some tips that will help resolve this issue as quickly as possible: \n\n1. Be sure to submit as much information in your initial ticket as possible. For obvious reasons, each Player Support Specialist's request for more information will delay the resolution of the issue.\n2. Be respectful and polite in your correspondences with Riot Support. (They're doing their best to help you!)\n3. Try not to create a new ticket or respond to an existing ticket before a Player Support Specialist has had the chance to review your request. New tickets/replies may bump your ticket back to the bottom of the queue, thus increasing the amount of time before a Player Support Specialist is able to review your ticket.  \n\n**If you're unsure where to put your ticket in, just select:**\n[*I have a question about League of Legends/Riot Games.*] > [*Game and Features*] > [*General Questions*]\n\nWith that being said, good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Human Ryze","date":"2016-07-25T02:13:57.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wuks,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=rErJXAHv,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-07-21T15:07:03.540+0000)\n\n> With that being said, good luck!\n\nHey Wuks, I too would like to change my name, but not just capitalization. As you're aware \"Human Ryze\" is a reference to a rare skin for Ryze. Riot have now removed that skin and replaced it with \"Young Ryze\" . I Sent a ticket to support asking if they would see fit to give me a free name change to Young Ryze since they removed a skin I was named after, I got a template \"We only change offensive names\" reply from Riot support tickets.\n\nI'm just expressing that after all I've read on boards about Riot support helping people and being funny, giving away 1-2RP for people that draw horrid MSPaint pictures etc that they would say hey, you're right your name is that of a skin that we actually removed from the game, we don't normally remove skins from the game so on this occasion sure, we'll give you some RP for a name change or just change your name for you.\n\nBut alas. I am disappointed - FeelsBadMan - what are your thoughts on my situation?","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-07-25T02:43:18.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The current policies only allow Support to change Summoner Names for players who have offensive Summoner Names and/or violate the Terms of Use.
