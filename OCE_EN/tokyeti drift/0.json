This is actually the first piece of LoL fanfiction I wrote, but I think it&#039;s fairly appropriate for the contest. And I also like it. So I edited it a bit. Be cool to hear what anyone thinks of it, what may or may not work, etc. Not 100% sure if I might submit this at this stage--I&#039;m a sucker for the PROJECT skins so I might try to write something new for that.\r\n\r\nBest enjoyed while listening to the Aatrox login and going &quot;dududududududududu.&quot;\r\n.\r\n\r\n -----------------\r\n\r\n He had been here before. \r\n\r\nIn times of peace the valley had been a verdant sea of wild grass livened by twisted flowers and choking weeds. A large cliff overlooked either side of the valley, enveloping it like a cocoon. He had been here in the night, when the darkness swallowed up the features of the field and the stillness became a creature unto itself. He stood on the cliffs now, and looked to fields below. The humans had fought the entire day, and through the night. The silence was marred by war, and their torches blazed as furious aberrations in the darkness. There was no stillness here. \r\nHe had watched all of this. He had seen the countless deaths, the rising tide of blood, had heard the exhausted silences, and the desperate cries for victory. None of this moved him. He still watched, unblinking, so still that those who saw him took him for some dark, winged statue. He had yet to make up his mind. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;You waste your time on these humans,&rdquo; a voice whispered. Still he did not turn. He knew the voice, and who it belonged to. She would be delighted to break his concentration. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; was all he said. He heard the rustling of the grass trampled beneath his sister&rsquo;s claws, watched impassively as she walked past him. Her black lips quirked in annoyance and she turned her back to the dying humans, her wings flaring dramatically. She had always been impatient. \r\n&ldquo;\r\nI cannot comprehend this obsession of yours. Surely you have seen them kill themselves enough by now.&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;You do not see what I see,&rdquo; Aatrox whispered. That was his name, though he used it so rarely he sometimes forgot it. Names held little importance for them&mdash;they were only five. He remembered their features better. His sister, for instance, was the impatient one with the wings like a bat&rsquo;s. He found he could not remember her name. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;And what is it you see?&rdquo; She demanded, clearly annoyed. He did not care. His far-seeing eyes watched as a young boy was impaled on a spike, watched the boy&#039;s disbelief as the life spilled from him. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Our lives are not candles so short as these,&rdquo; He said, by way of an explanation. &ldquo;Yet they burn theirs to the quick. Did you never wonder why?&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;I never cared,&rdquo; she replied bluntly. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;You do them a disservice. All that they are is compressed down to this. These moments. Look, a man dies on a sword. Look, a father bleeds to death. Look. A boy becomes a killer.&rdquo; Still he did not waver, his arms crossed over one another as he watched. His sister at the very least feigned interest and glanced down at the field. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Look! A boy shits himself,&rdquo; she said sarcastically.  \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Aatrox agreed. &ldquo;His body has failed him. All for honour.&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Human honour,&rdquo; she sneered. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;But honour, just the same.&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;So, have you made up your mind?&rdquo; His sister crossed her arms and paced around him, clearly trying to provoke him. He pretended not to hear her. &ldquo;Which one of them will die?&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;They will all die, in time,&rdquo; Aatrox said. &ldquo;I do not always intervene. It depends.&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;On what?&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;On what they would become,&rdquo; Aatrox said simply. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;I thought you just enjoyed killing them,&rdquo; his sister shrugged. For the first time, Aatrox&rsquo;s eyes flickered from the battlefield, to her. From the grin on her face, she took this as a victory. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yes. To see their blood flow, to cut the life from them &hellip; that is its own reward.&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how.&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;If I cut the life from you,&rdquo; Aatrox pointed out, &ldquo;You would rise again. But they do not. Yet here they are.&rdquo; He gestured with his left hand across the battlefield. &ldquo;Staking their own precious blood against the blood of thousands more.&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;You just decided, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; She asked. She knew, by now, that he could not be broken from his stillness until his choice had been made. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yes. It was your talk of honour which suggested an &hellip; entertainment.&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Bother yourself to watch,&rdquo; Aatrox promised, &ldquo;And you will see.&rdquo; \r\n\r\nBut that was the final straw. With a flap of her wings, his sister was off. She did not value the humans as he did. She did not understand the measure of their suffering, as he did. Their lives, and their deaths, woven through only by their blood. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;This shall be my masterpiece,&rdquo; he promised himself. It was an incantation, one he whispered before his every descent into the human world. It was the great fact of his life that he could only predict so much of what they would do. Even he, with all his experience, could never fully tell what came of all that blood. Which was why he cared in the first place. \r\n\r\nHis sword pulsed in his hand, that basest part of him hungry for battle. He spread his wings and began to rise, slowly, feeling the current of death in the battlefield below, feeding on its strength. A dozen of the humans were surrounded, fighting badly, losing. He chose them. \r\nHe plummeted towards the earth, crashing directly onto the body of one of their attackers. The weak human flesh was crushed by his descent, and he knocked the body aside. The silence found him again, as it always did. That one, perfect moment, when the humans looked upon him, not knowing, not daring to guess what he was. He saw into the faces of those he had condemned to death. He wondered how each of them would die. \r\n\r\nAnd he turned to a young boy, who wore a crown&mdash;vaguely it registered that this boy was some sort of a prince. \r\n\r\nThe threads of fate seldom disappoint, he thought. He saw the terror in the boy&rsquo;s eyes, and the hope, too: the figure, the monster had just killed one of his enemies. Aatrox waited. He let the boy understand. This was what he needed. To kill them. To take their lives, as he clung desperately to his own. When the boy understood, he spoke. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Die, and be forgotten,&rdquo; he promised. &ldquo;Or fight, and be a hero.&rdquo; \r\n\r\n -----------------\r\n\r\nThe famous cathedrals of Demacia were ancient structures. Marvels of engineering, they were decorated with angels and gargoyles, and most of all with the stained glass windows that portrayed the great victories in Demacia&rsquo;s history. One cathedral bore a new window which portrayed the young prince&rsquo;s defeat of a dragon, aided by his half-dragon ally. \r\n\r\nBut many of the cathedrals were old enough to have slipped beyond the short reach of living memory. There was one in a small village along the coast, its walls crumbling and falling into disrepair, its windows cracked and faded. It was rumoured to be one of the very first cathedrals ever commissioned in the name of the King, the first King, centuries ago. None of the scholars knew whether any of the figures depicted bore any resemblance to the once-living, but one window was so fanciful that it was regarded as little more than the whimsy of some long-dead artist. On it there was a warrior, glad in golden armour, with a huge, angelic sword and shimmering purple wings. He bore a helmet unlike any known to history, and dominated a battlefield, his weapon raised over the head of the young king. \r\n\r\nIt bore an inscription beneath it: &ldquo;The Justicar.&rdquo; Most of the villagers decided the Justicar was a figure of legend, a symbol of Demacian justice and strength of will. But none of this explained the chill associated with the cathedral, or the local superstitions surrounding that old building, fallen into disuse and disrepair. None of this dispelled the unshakeable feeling shared by any who walked in the shadow of the cathedral: that they were being watched.","replies":[{"poster":"ThunderWielder","date":"2017-03-15T12:14:07.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I liked the way this piece was written but didn't know which skin was being talked about until the very end (excepting the title).
