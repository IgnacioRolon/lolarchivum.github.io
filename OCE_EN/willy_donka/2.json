I guess what some people don't realise is that she actually can't kill you in a single rotation like Viktor or Syndra can. These changes will leave her dueling and laning power so much weaker making her even more vulnerable to her counters than ever before.","replies":[{"poster":"Willy Donka","date":"2016-11-21T11:42:26.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this Flash Frost (Q) - now only slows those stunned by Flash Frost instead of those damage by Flash Frost.\n\nand her E is pretty stupid. she already had her E damage nerfed by quite a lot and i got used to that. but now they just seem to nerf whatever i play. and whatever i hate they buff. i think rito hates me","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2016-11-20T01:17:58.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"the e nerf is deserved. the double damage aspect was cancerous when she could turn r on and off immediately and then hit you like a truck.","replies":[{"poster":"Willy Donka","date":"2016-11-21T11:38:15.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"meanwhile lux chunks health with her ult...\nyasuo infinitly dashes...\nand graves doesnt get his meme","replies":[{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2016-11-28T10:55:58.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yoshiwizard,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=VG4zrE92,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-11-21T11:38:15.329+0000)\n>\n> meanwhile lux chunks health with her ult...\n> yasuo infinitly dashes...\n> and graves doesnt get his meme\n\n*cough*, ults are supposed to chunk your health, idiot, it's just a matter of sidestepping it","replies":[]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-11-21T23:53:45.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"when this person compares a champions E to another champions ult","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2016-11-22T02:19:50.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These are good nerfs.

Yasuo can be countered by CC\n2. Considering the assassin buff, Jinx is no longer that effective like she used to\n4. Irelia is tanky but as long as you play right against her, it shouldn't be much of a problem\n\n\n\nI get that you are frustrated over the nerf to your champion but it happens, Zed got nerfed and I was really frustrated but that's just how the game works. I do agree though that Yasuo needs a nerf and i'm pretty sure that Riot is trying to find out how to nerf him. Nerfing a champion is easier said than done.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-11-21T23:54:35.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"better not nerf a champ cause counters exist fuck lol\n\nwhen is heimer getting buffs then, considering syndra rapes him","replies":[]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-11-21T23:52:35.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a lot of these are buffs and that Q thing doesnt exist","replies":[]},{"poster":"Willy Donka","date":"2016-11-21T11:44:31.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im starting to think that lux is cursing me along with her patch because my main gets nerfed really hard in her patch. but she gets 10 extra skins and still one-shots non-tanks","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-11-20T00:57:02.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"How is 1 hitting you less broken than needing to use skill to snowball on yasuo, sure after you're snowballed he is easier to play, but up until then he needs a load of skill not to feed.
