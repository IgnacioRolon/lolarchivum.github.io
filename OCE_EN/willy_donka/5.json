It's disgusting. It's completely disgusting that everyone is just sitting back and letting them make an extremely overpriced product when the system they had going was working, and was more reasonable.\r\n\r\nTHEY DON'T EVEN EARN MORE MONEY FROM IT!\r\n\r\nThink about it, imagine you have 100 people, 10 people out of that 100 buy the skins for $100 that's $1000 for riot, cool.\r\nNow, 90 people buy a pass for $15, that's $1350 for riot.\r\n\r\nIt's just dumb, I can't understand it. Maybe if you got the prestige tokens from buying skins or RP it'd be more reasonable so that you don't have to buy some dumb chests that rarely give you anything good.\r\n\r\nLike, prestige skins aren't ultimate skins or anything higher, they're mythic, which is another word for \"Limited time Epic\" They aren't Extremely good quality skins, that's why they are in passes, $15 is the reasonable price for an Epic quality skin. The pass also works better because then you have people actually PLAYING your game. \r\n\r\nRant over?","replies":[{"poster":"Outis","date":"2019-02-23T10:45:25.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"share holders want it, therefore it happens. there is literally nothing you can do about it. even voting with wallet does not work as long as shareholders want and demand it. their only legal obligation is to them. you are nothing. besides, lots of people vote 'yes' with their wallets. and those are the people these are clearly targeted at. aka whales. it's not about pricing and '10 for 100 vs 90 for 15'. they see it as offering some 'premium' (that isn't actually premium, just a reskin aka next to 0 cost) item that the whales who exist will eat up as they have observed to happen in a myriad of other games. if you know there are idiots who play your game that will pay $100 for the same thing (very slightly different) then why wouldn't you offer it to them?\n\n\nit's exactly like car manufacturers targeting idiots who pay thousands more for a 'premium' model of the same car because of a special word similar to 'prestige' and has a few aesthetic differences.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-02-22T11:07:49.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People have already had their visible outrage, at this point I think more people are just taking the \"speak with your wallet\" approach.

So unless you're able to convince vast swathes of the community to stop playing completely, I don't see how you're supposed to \"stop\" Riot from doing what they want?\n\nThis is why Riot do these things, because it has very little negative consequence for them.  They know that the majority of people are not going to stop playing completely just because they released a few overpriced skins.  People will be mad for a few weeks, then realise it's staying, and just live with it. Like always, and they know this.\n\nSo what proposal do you have to make us \"stop\" them?\n_(i'm genuinely keen to hear an actual plan of attack, because I want this BS stopped too)_","replies":[]}]}
