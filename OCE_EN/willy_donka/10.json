And if you did add that and you only got a emote would it be worth it?\r\n\r\nThis isn&#039;t major it&#039;s just that it doesn&#039;t feel rewarding to get mastery 7. There is some ways to make mastery 7 actually worth the grind:\r\n\r\n* Custom emote/banner: have some preset parts for the mastery EX: the gem in the middle of the mastery, the wings on the side, a champion portrait inside the center gem, coloring the gem, or a bronze, silver and gold colored frame for the emote.\r\n* Dynamic background of the champion or it&#039;s legendary skin or maybe what one of it&#039;s skins login screens were. \r\n* A champion mastery icon. Simple.\r\n* Champion based chest: Gives you a skin for that champion only that can be rare, epic, legendary or ultimate.\r\n* Custom emote+: Say you got the mastery 7 on a champion like Ahri, you could get something for your emote that is unique to him/her like her charm. You could have a heart shaped gem or something like that for her. or maybe Anivia could have an Iced frame. these special mastery parts would be usable on all of your champions. Or it would just be a universal emote for every champion.\r\n\r\nthose are just idea&#039;s probably won&#039;t be looked or acknowledged so just leave some hate comments on how stupid these ideas are or, leave some replies as to how good they might be.\r\n\r\n-Willy Donka and his stupid idea for the month.{{champion:34}} \r\n\r\n(kinda pulled most of this out of my ass as I wrote this so if it makes no sense don&#039;t judge.)","replies":[{"poster":"oPuredo","date":"2017-02-20T12:21:30.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Getting an S is quite easy.

You have almost no control over your profiles background. Like I said, If we could have a dynamic background for the champion we main or an icon for that champion, we could say we main that champion while playing a different one.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrPine","date":"2017-02-18T10:51:18.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its easily exploitable","replies":[{"poster":"MrPine","date":"2017-02-18T10:52:02.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"btw replied based on title only","replies":[{"poster":"Willy Donka","date":"2017-02-19T05:11:29.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How are rewards exploitable?
