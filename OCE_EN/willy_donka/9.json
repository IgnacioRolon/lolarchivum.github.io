When people are patching their clients and They are taking the new files It puts load on the servers, If people are also putting through store transactions this more load. As someone who works in IT this is quite Possible. But its also likely that These are all separate servers. EG the Logon, Client and Game servers are all separate. But the patch server may also share the store, I dont know riots network topography so this is only speculation, But if it Helps, Unless its a special release like High profile skins (EG Worlds skins, Star Guardian or Legendary skin) they normally release on the Thursday following the patch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nikkip","date":"2017-08-09T19:23:39.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Marketing purposes I assume. They would rather have a consistent outflow of new and interesting content to keep players coming back day after day than dump a lot of it out together and have a longer down time until the next cool stuff. Kinda like how lots of Youtube channels have recorded series several videos in advance but pace them out over time to maximize interest.","replies":[]}]}
