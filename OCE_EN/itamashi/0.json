So after a few minutes I am in champion select, but what&#039;s that? I am support - the very lane, that I didn&#039;t wanna play at all. At first I asked my teammates, if somebody could switch, but no one did and so I, knowing that playing support would only take my fun away and give my team an incompetent supp, I left. \r\n\r\nSo why the hell does this feature exist?! It doesn&#039;t make any sense!\r\n_&quot;But it&#039;s quicker this way!&quot;_, some of you might say, but as you&#039;ve seen in my example, it doesn&#039;t work. Many people will think the same way I did and just leave, if they get a lane they absolutely don&#039;t wanna play, which increases the waiting time, not only for me, but for my whole team. And even if nobody would leave after being assigned to a lane, that they don&#039;t wanna play, how&#039;s that of any use? Yeah, you can play your match, but at what cost? The person forced to play a role probably won&#039;t enjoy it, nor (in most cases) be good at it. This doesn&#039;t only ruin the experience for that one player, but for his entire team as well.\r\n\r\nBesides that, I don&#039;t have a problem with waiting five or six minutes more in order to get one of the two lanes, that I chose. **I prefer my lanes over my waiting time, that&#039;s why I play fucking draft pick in the first place!** If I don&#039;t get to play the lanes I want, I can as well go blind pick, which makes draft nearly obsolete. \r\n\r\nSure, they wanna get people to play support or other unpopular lanes, but there are way better methods. For example the concept of having more free to play supps, that they implemented lately.\r\nSo how can Riot have such good ideas, but on the other hand introduce stupid changes (autofill) like a bunch of brain-dead morons?\r\n\r\nRiot tries to have a good relation to its player, but this just can&#039;t happen, if they do such retarded crap, that is not only beyond any rational reason, but also annoys the hell out of most players.\r\n\r\n**So please Riot, stop such counter-productive idiocies and focus on keeping the game fun. The player that care about a quick queue can always play blind pick and people that care about playing a certain lane can play draft. Don&#039;t solve problems, that didn&#039;t exist in the first place, goddammit.**","replies":[]}
