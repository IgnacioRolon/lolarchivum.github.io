I really hate &quot;Oracle Alteration&quot;{{item:3364}}  this item. I don&#039;t understand why it not only\r\nhave Sweeping effect follows for 10 seconds, but also have the ability for enemy to &quot;Ignore&quot; my mushroom.{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \r\nThis item should only have sweeping effect and give the enemy have a chance to &quot;Destroy&quot; the invisible objects not to &quot;Ignore&quot; it.\r\nMy mushrooms have become useless and can&#039;t help me to escape from every signal kill, especially this guy {{champion:120}} .\r\nI hope u guys can fix it for poor Teemo.\r\n\r\nRegards{{champion:17}}","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2016-11-16T12:58:28.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I agree with you that I can imagine this item being quite annoying you have to think of it in the perspective that Teemo shrooms can be used for more than just the damage they deal and the slow that they provide.\n\nWhen you place one down that area in a sense is controlled by you. Yes the enemy can come in and remove the shroom by stepping on it, taking the damage and the slow, or remove it by using a sweeper both give you information. Information as to where the enemy is, what their health is at and possibly other information. Effectively if you think of your shrooms in this way they can be used like wards that also have the chance of doing damage. Letting you out rotate your opponents and know where they are.\n\nThis also poses the question of if you are using them like wards, how do you make it so that they don't all get removed at once. This I think is a positive reason for the sweeper being in the game. To elaborate on this with sweeper being an item that people can buy you have to carefully plan and think through where you place your mine field in a sense. You can place them all near to each other to possibly deal a massive blow to the enemy, but risk them all being removed in 1-2 sweepers. Or on the other hand you can spread them out further, hide them in hard to find locations when going from one shroom to the other but still putting them in valuable locations for information.\n\nI think this is a big reason towards why sweeper is in the game, adding that depth of gameplay in mind as to where you want to place the traps that you do have available to you. Its not just a sense of I want to place this down here because of only X reason, but there are quite a few things to consider which adds more layers of strategy, leading them to a greater sense of mains of similar champions learning together to find in this case creative spots that are unique to place shrooms and sharing it within their community and friends that they have.\n\nI hope that helps explain a bit as to why I think this might be the case why sweepers have the ability to do this. If you have any questions or need clarification on anything let me know, and good luck in your games.\n\n~Elam","replies":[]}]}
