Creation and Clan wars?","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been thinking about Clans, and clan wars and was thinking that maybe this could fit into league of legends. For example, you have a clan you are in. It could have its own friends list so you can check who is online and see if anyone was up for a war. Clans vs Clans, teams vs teams. Create a clan and make it huge, get members to create teams from within the clan, Clan wars where you challenge another clan to a series of PvP games, maybe even an option of how long of a series EG ; 3 games, 5 games 7 games.  Clan Summoner icons. the idea that once you join a clan you cannot leave it. a creation of loyalty within a clan. you go into game modes and choose the option of clan battle. You go onto your profile and Have your personal profile, then your Ranked 5vs profiles and then you have your clan profile. \r\n\r\nWith Clans implemented into the game, players could find the help they need to learn the game, players can help others out, it can promote Teamwork,  and friendship. \r\n\r\nI believe that clans would be a great add into League of legends. and i would love to see if anyone else feels the same way \r\n\r\nFeel free to vote on my stawpoll, to Either see if we can get the vote of the players to try and get riot to do this or if you dont want to see it. all feedback will be great\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://strawpoll.me/3181530","replies":[{"poster":"Lonely Flame","date":"2014-12-16T04:31:13.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So Ranked Teams?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-16T05:04:03.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranked teams have a maximum of 9 people.

You can still have your smaller, more focused groups for actual Ranked matches, and larger groups for Clans.\n\nPersonally, I'm against Clans mainly because it devolves into clans raging against other clans and it becomes a huge mess and yeh.","replies":[{"poster":"You need Jesus","date":"2015-03-05T05:24:14.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because it would bring another aspect into the game","replies":[]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-27T03:39:46.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"clans could have rewards for vsing rival clans, even just meeting them in normal games.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CRAZIGIRL7","date":"2014-12-27T00:34:34.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So that's basically mashing up Clash of Clans with League of Legends.","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-27T03:39:09.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"clash of clans wasnt the first thing with clans....lol","replies":[{"poster":"CRAZIGIRL7","date":"2014-12-27T07:39:20.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol I didn't know","replies":[]}]}]}]}
