Our adc is not a pleasant person he all caps yells at everyone for the slightest things and sometimes for things the other 4 people can't fathom.\r\n\r\nSo in this close, fun and all round great game he decides screw it leona this is your game 5 for gold right? Me \"yeah man lets do this\" He then afk's purely to spite me my adc as a support who has warded, not ks'd when possible built correctly done everything I as a lowly oceanic scrub just climbing his way up the ranks can be decides no you don't deserve gold im afk. Team completely gives up even with me trying to band everyone together they all concede since to them its over.\r\n\r\nIm not mad im not angry im just really offended pretty sure this is the first thing ive ever actuality typed on the forums now that I think about it.

I would never intentionally take my teammates kills as a support.\n\nThat being said, if my team is struggling, I often switch to \"AP-Support\" meaning I still get the essential support items:\n\n{{item:3092}} + {{item:2045}} + {{item:3341}}\n\nHowever I then proceed to build AP.
