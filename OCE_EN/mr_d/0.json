That way I can hopefully get someone to look into it a bit more closely.\n\n\n+ Have you double-checked all the other sites and services (e.g PayPal) that might have used that email? It's possible that when you login there'll be a way to see it.\n\n Maybe friends have sent you email? Ask them to check if they have.\n\nAlso, my bet would be that PayPal transaction ID is not enough information. There's an official account recovery process but you need to know a lot of info about your account (e.g creation date, first 10 purchased champions, first 5 skins purchased), and considering you can't even remember the email I don't think that's a good option just yet.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr D","date":"2017-11-15T18:53:00.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey man thanks its, #32556082\n\nmy paypal email is separate from all others and is used specifically for paypal only, so i can keep track of whats going on with it and keep the account secure, literally the only thing that email has in it are paypal receipts.\n\nin my conversation with riot support i gave them my paypal email so they can send a quick message to it and i can reply back to confirm that its me, i haven't got a message from them about that yet, if one of your guys can get a hold of me via the email i used to issue the support ticket then ill hand it over, sorry if this seems shady but i dont want to post my emails (especially this one) on a public forum","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-11-21T04:19:50.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry I took so long, my usual contact was unavailable. Unfortunately, your PayPal transaction IDs are not enough evidence on their own to recover an account, but they are strong supporting evidence during the account recovery process. \n\nHere's my recommendation for your case:\n\n+ Send in a [Riot Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) ticket in the _\"I need help recovering my account.\"_ section if you haven't already.\n\n\n+ Tell them that you have lost access to the email and forgotten the password, and would like to go through the account recovery process.\n\n\n+ They should send you a bunch of questions, answer those as best you can (they will be tough, you may beed to ask friends and family to help you remember some), then supply your PayPal transaction IDs as additional evidence. Also mention literally anything else you think is good evidence that you are the account holder (e.g credit cards used, maybe you remember buying X champion on release date with IP... etc.)\n\nI wish you the best of luck :D","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-11-15T14:49:07.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the intruder has access to your email (which is how a decent chunk of accounts get compromised) then a paypal receipt is something they would also have access too. This is why paypal receipts aren't enough on their own. They help your case certainly, but you need a good mix of things to verify ownership.\n\nYou don't necessarily have to remember details from 8 years ago either, any information that isn't visible on the account works. The questions they give are a guideline and are sufficient for most players, but for some it isn't enough. You want to send them info like dates (even approximate) you purchased skins or champions, that aren't still or have recently been visible in your purchase history. \n\nFor example maybe you remember buying Surprise Party Fiddlesticks within a day or two of it's release. Any information unique to your account but not visible on it is useful in verifying ownership.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr D","date":"2017-11-15T19:02:45.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my paypal uses a separate email for security purposes.\n\nive been looking at the account from the outside through OPGG and with this account and it has no activity on it whatsoever, no games have been played and the account never goes online, it could either be compromised and is being advertised for sale?

They don't know that you use a different email. This is about Riot verifying the account not you, since you obviously know who the owner is.\n\nThat's hell cool about the Fiddle skin :) I'm sure an account like that has a lot of sentiment, so good luck getting it back. If you managed to answer or partially answer a decent number of the questions they gave you then I'm sure a few more pieces of info will be enough.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
