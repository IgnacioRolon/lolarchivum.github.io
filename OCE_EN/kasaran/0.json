Well, one sprang to mind as the images of his art filled my mind, and suddenly a question arose within me... Jhin, that would be Jhin... but he seems to be lacking something to complete the quintessential role of &quot;most dangerous and lethal serial killer of all time&quot;... a mistake. Something that he&#039;d never expect might come to be perfection in having left it incomplete.\r\n\r\n&quot;1. 2. 3-&quot;\r\n\r\nAnd then there was no release, a mistake as he was forced to retreat, leaving his work unfinished and scarred for life... and likewise, what could come from such trauma? What is it that serial killers seem to bring on in droves, but Jhin himself seems to lack? I&#039;ll be forward about this for those of you having difficulty tracking. He has no copycats... no aspiring proteges. He is alone, or perhaps that&#039;s what we&#039;ve all been led to believe.\r\n\r\nI give you my Proposed Champion, someone to put into perspective the other side of psychosis. Not one wishing to be recognized for their work, to prove their independence, but one wishing to be recognized for their work, to prove their competence. Promised perfection at a young age, and yet suffering so much, the one we know as Izen Thel is hardly that, but he tries his best to make due.\r\n\r\nHorribly disfigured by Jhin, in the wake of his old traveling stagehand days, Thel is one of a very select few who can say they came face-to-face with the man in his element, and survived. His story, however, is one of mistakes he wishes to set straight. To correct. Constant, almost incessant recitation of creeds and mottos taken from the words he heard all those years ago, Thel is the fanatic, where Jhin is the virtuous.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is that Thel is weak on all fronts, but gains his power through sustained trades and attacks. Just like Jhin, if you can keep the crits coming, Thel will reward aggressive players, and punish those whom test his resolve. Using dark magic, honed over years of studying to complement the almost impossible style of his great inspiration, Khada Jhin, Izen Thel is the meticulously repetitive practitioner of his own &#039;art&#039;.\r\n\r\nInstead of using powerful physical attacks off the bat, Thel would rather have incredibly weak stats, making him definitely a late-game champ, reflective of his own growth in life. Thel&#039;s one boon would be his passive, &quot;Practice Makes Perfect&quot; which would tie into his abilities and his high focus on skill-shots type abilities. In short? &quot;Practice Makes Perfect&quot; is a passive that rewards players with a stacking 3% damage to their Ability Power for every consecutive hit they land on an enemy. This damage scales up to 54% at level 18, making those who build AP capable of reaching devastatingly high combo-attack power.\r\n\r\nWhere then, comes Thel&#039;s weakness? His lack of any particularly good champion traits. Everything in his kit is centered entirely on the idea of &quot;Practice Makes Perfect&quot;. As Thel &#039;grows&#039; through the game, he becomes more powerful, but even then that&#039;s only through focusing on one &#039;target&#039; at a time, making consecutive attacks do more and more damage as he carries through on his attacks. His auto attacks count towards this damage, but his abilities are what really bring home the idea that Thel is a man with a mission to become &#039;perfection incarnate&#039; within his particular style of &#039;art&#039;.\r\n\r\nAbility Ideas such as &quot;Harmonious Transition&quot;, &quot;Finishing Stroke&quot;, and &quot;Void Crescendo&quot;, centering on his musical aptitude, shadowing his own muse&#039;s tastes would offer lethal execution power and offer him exceedingly high combination burst power. Harmonious Transition would be a high cooldown, low mana cost ability and likely his E or Q. The idea behind it is that for a short time after activating (starting at 1 second at level one, increasing by 0.33-0.5 seconds per champion level to a maximum of roughly 6 seconds), Thel can transfer between targets of opportunity at will, carrying over his stacking ability power. As Harmonious Transition would level up, it would inversely become more expensive as it is a special sort of channel, it can also be used by Thel while in his Ult&#039;d mode, &quot;Fanatical Urge&quot; which would set up a kill field of a certain radius around him, giving him the chance for a certain amount of time to move freely and near instantaneously around the area he&#039;s built up, damaging all units in his way including friendly units. Harmonious Transition would allow his damage ability within this area and time to increase nigh exponentially given the right movements and could spell instantaneous death for low health enemies or those with poor MR in the late game.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll carry on more about this later, but these are the general ideas I have, tell me what you think.\r\n\r\n**Izen Thel**\r\n\r\n_&quot;The Fanatic&quot;_\r\n\r\n**ROLE**\r\nAssassin/Jungler??\r\n\r\n**LORE**\r\nWIP","replies":[{"poster":"Cosmicpanda2","date":"2017-07-17T11:52:09.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"reading your idea for his passive, and from briefly reading your ideas for attacks...\nHe sounds like Zed and Veigar fused with one another\nThe mobility and execution of Zed, combined with a passive that makes you hit like a train propelled by a nuke if you just spam a spell enough times. \nA good concept, and lore interaction sounds fun (Despite the fact that Riot has all but abandoned any actual coherent lore at this point), but overall i don't think many players would like this guy on release.\nI will go back again to my reference on Veigar.\nThe reason this ball of raw hate and death doesn't get a lot of play is because of his atrocious early to mid game. He has no redeeming qualities early game aside from fairly decent but short ranged nukes, or nukes that get easily dodged, and a stun that can zone, but has too large a cool down to waste its incredible utility.\nBasically, hes only powerful if he is fed like crazy, or that game drags on for ages\nand in a game that has a surrender system, that is exactly something that happens often. \nWhat I'm trying to say is that as good as a concept this champion is, he is simply too much of a slow burner to be in a game like LoL, and most players don't like champions that are useless throughout extensive periods of the game, primarily that of the mid game.\nGood work on this champ, but might i suggest a better formatting design for your idea pitch.\nBasically arrange it like so\n>Lore\n>Static Passive\n>Q\n>W\n>E\n>R\nmakes it so much easier to read and allows you to give a proper rundown of your idea\nif you don't have all the details for this list sorted, its probably best you dont post until you fully map out and workshop your idea before presenting it. Nothing screams uncertainty more than a half baked idea filled with hypotheticals\nGood luck with your future ideas, and remember, keep in mind both thematics AND gameplay","replies":[]}]}
