If you'd like to help us dig into this:~~\n\n~~1. Please download and install the [Hextech Repair Tool (HRT)](https://lolstatic-a.akamaihd.net/player-support/tools/hextech-repair-tool/latest/Hextech%20Repair%20Tool.msi). (If you've already got the HRT installed, uninstall it and then install this latest version.~~\n~~2. Once you've opened the HRT, deselect the \"Automatically Assign\" and \"Add Firewall Exceptions\" options, we won't be needing those.~~\n~~3. Click Start.~~\n~~4. A .zip file will be created on your desktop called LoL Logs. Attach this file in an email to ocelivereports@riotgames.com~~\n\n~~We will then pass these logs on for investigation.~~\n\nUPDATE: The logs we've collected are not revealing the cause of this issue. The team responsible for this issue is aware and is investigating. Current known workarounds (short of restarting or reinstalling the client completley) include:\n- Opening Task Manager and ending the League of Legends process\n- Temporarily lowering your screen resolution\n\nNote that when you do successfully select the champion you want the champion isn't just added to your account, rather, it gives you a Hextech Crafting shard for a \"champion permanent\" which you can redeem for the champion or disenchant for essence from the Loot tab.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-12-01T11:25:02.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submit a ticket to player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nI've heard of a few of such issues around but don't personally know of any solution so far.
