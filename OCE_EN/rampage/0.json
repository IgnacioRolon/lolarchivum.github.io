The email I received said I had been permanently banned for the use of a third party program. \n\nI have used a custom skin changer in the past, other than that I have no idea what the reason would be. I have received two responses from riot:\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/00c63f5550c0e9d7840996f5a21450f6\n\n https://gyazo.com/39890c9628de270bb055cab21a79f4d3\n\nSo I am getting told I was caught using an exploit, when I know for sure I haven&#039;t been. I have had my account since early 2012 - not something I would ever risk for something so stupid. \n\nHas this happened to anyone else before? And more importantly does Riot ban users permanently and without warning for a custom skin changer.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-04-23T18:09:23.784+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"nobody can know the truth. you could be lying or riots system could be not working as expected. anything can be considered by riot as an unauthorised program. maybe the custom skins for your game actually helped with your gameplay. you might know this, or you dont. maybe the program or the programmers you got the skins from started making exploits and riots banning anyone at all thats dealt with the program or the programmers unique code","replies":[]},{"poster":"Narwhal","date":"2016-04-23T11:57:48.860+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe re-title your post as, \nfairly banned don't download third party programs as they can get you banned for exploitation.\nMe posting on forums twice about this ban that was completely fair, did not change the outcome at all.\n\n\n-also I am sorry if you did get banned just for a skin changer but I mean, like IAkeno said, you took the risk and paid the price","replies":[{"poster":"Rampage","date":"2016-04-23T12:11:29.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get that using one is at my own risk, but they are telling me that I was benefiting from the use of an exploit.

There has been at least 3 people that I know this week who had the same problem. Please do contact riot about this via support ticket if you have any questions. I believe they won't unban your account however. Sorry about that =(.
