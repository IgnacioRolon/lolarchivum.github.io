You win more games your MMR rises regardless of your lp.\n\nIf you are getting 17 or less lp per win your mmr is below that ranks average, 17-20 is the sweet spot and 20+ is when your MMR is higher than your perceived rank.\n\nit is literally as simple as that.\n\nA challenger smurf playing on a fresh (inflated) account would easily break 35+lp per win and start skipping a lot of ranks (eg go from silver 3 to gold 4 in 1 set of promo games) as the MMR is way higher than there actual shown rank.\n\nYou think it LOOKS one sided but in fact I would guarantee the ranks are a lot closer than you think. If we could actually see our real MMR I guarantee that if you took all 5 on your team, added them all up and then divided by 5 and do the same to the other team that number would be very close. This is how the system works.\n\nThe system does NOT match each persons number individually.\n\n1600+1400+1400+1400+1400 VS 1600+1450+1350+1350+1350\n\nIf you take those above lets say you are 1600 on the team on the right hand side. Your team MMR is 7100/5=1420\n\nThe other team is 7200/5=1440\n\nSee how the numbers look so different but in fact the teams are very very close to being even?","replies":[{"poster":"TM06ASF","date":"2017-02-03T11:35:50.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for taking the time to explain this guess ill just have to try and get better and carry lol. im usually getting 25 plus lp a win and 15 or so for a loss so my mmr is a bit higher than my current ranking ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"gimble","date":"2017-02-03T01:30:31.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe the problem here is the role assigned to the 'highest' MMR player.\nMaybe on one team the jungler is the 1600 and impacts play all over the map... and the other team the support is 1600, with a bonobo for an adc, so no matter how many plays the support makes... it doesn't help.\n\nMaybe given the way role select works they could match lanes by MMR instead of whole team average.\nOnly problem would be lane swapping then I guess which would throw things out.","replies":[{"poster":"Shana Rei","date":"2017-02-03T05:46:53.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True but that is the problem, no matter what system you use something is always broken.\n\nTo me a big part of the matchmaking that doesn't work are provisional matches.\n\nIf everyone started at 0LP Bronze 5 every single person would experience climbing. However, since you play your 10 matches and either get lucky or not, you are more likely to end up at a rank different than you deserve and you either have to climb up and out or lose games against better players.\n\nIf everyone started at 0 the pros would climb up and out easily and everyone would filter to their appropriate ranks.\n\nHalo 3's ranking system had it's flaw but it's still the best system I have ever come across and everyone started at 0 in that.\n\nYou could even add \"boosting\" mechanics to ranked when a new season starts. What I mean is even though everyone starts at bronze 0 say you ended Master tier at the end of season six.\n\nAt the start of season 7 everyone gets 10 games (wins) worth of inflated LP. Masters could get 80LP for 10 wins (800LP total) (on top of the base LP gain). This pushes everyone up from 0 at a much more consistent rate than the total shot in the dark 10 provisional matches we have now.\n\nPeople always feel better when they are climbing and are far more likely to want to play ranked. Even us lowly silver plebs would have far more enjoyment in the game if we had to climb from bronze 5 back to silver 5. Instead of being given silver 5 and then not climbing anywhere. I know what I would rather do.","replies":[{"poster":"gimble","date":"2017-02-03T05:52:21.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have some great points.\nI always did wonder why new players would often get placed in B1-S4... set up for the big drop back to B5.\nSeems to make more sense to reset to 0 and let people climb to where they are supposed to be.","replies":[{"poster":"Shana Rei","date":"2017-02-03T06:01:53.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I forgot to add to your first post that what you wrote about support is exactly why I stopped playing support.\n\nWhy be the highest ranked (MMR wise) in the game but be the support and watch my potato adc not take the numerous free kills I set them up when I can just sit top lane, ignore everyone else in the game, stomp my laner, crush their mindset, gank other lanes and proceed to win (or lose)?\n\nObviously my sketchy system would be heavily refined but I truly believe even just starting at bronze 5 0lp would be a massive boon.\n\nI even made another account, got it to 30 and got it to the lowest rank I could (cough afk farming cough). When I did eventually climb back up from bronze 3 to silver 2 it wasn't like I smoked everyone on my way, it was still relatively hard for me and got harder the closer to my true rank (silver 2/3) until I plateaued.\n\nI had far more fun on that account than my main which I got silver 1 from provisional games and dropped down.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-02-03T02:49:02.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Besides LithiumLights and others have pretty much explained it in full, another thing seems to be that you also frequent Flex Queue. Were you playing alone in Flex Queue? Because that mode is designed for premades, and the matchmaking is pretty borked over there.\n\nBut yeah as explained, each team's MMR should be relatively equal in total. It's more to do with you tilting yourself after seeing the enemy players' ranks than to do with matchmaking balance really.","replies":[{"poster":"TM06ASF","date":"2017-02-03T11:33:57.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this comment was just about solo/duo it was a lot worse in flex hah","replies":[]}]}]}
