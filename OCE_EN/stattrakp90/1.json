Even if they don&#039;t stop being toxic, continuing with the two week bans will eventually make them stop, as they&#039;ll be sick to death of having to wait two weeks to play on their account, etc. What I don&#039;t understand, is the need for a Permanent Ban system in a Free to Play game.. Unless you get IP banned, which never happens (or at least not to my knowledge) the toxic player in question is just going to make a new account, and start the cycle all over again, except this time, they aren&#039;t gonna spend any RP, and they&#039;re most likely gonna be much more inclined to be salty.. (Not saying this is what is going to happen in my case, just an observation)\n\nIn other words, I was recently permabanned for being toxic. Okay, well deserved, I can understand that. Serious though, a permanent ban in a Free to Play title? Makes zero sense. After one two week suspension, and a lot of stress, I kept flaming and sure enough, the ban hammer came down. Keep your petty, self righteous &quot;I&#039;m glad %%%lords like you get banned hehehehe&quot; comments to yourself, and honestly think for a moment. \n\nPermanent bans, in an F2P Title where you can literally create a new account and play within minutes? Beats me. The only reason I can even think of would be to spite toxic people, which really isn't a smart plan. Continues the cycle, and so on. You never know the reason why a person may be being toxic, etc etc. \n\nLong story short. Give it a think, and get back to me. It's been boggling my mind.","replies":[{"poster":"Bunny","date":"2016-02-08T07:10:06.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They can make more money if you have to create a completely new account and have to repurchase everything.

For some people, the cost of time is little or nothing to them, so they simply do not care, they will play on another account or do something else then come back and do the same thing. RP on the other hand is bought with real money, a resource that people tend to value much more highly and thus serves as a much better punishment fro those who still refuse to reform.\n\nYour behaviour is your responsibility.\n\nFree to play games tend to attract the worser communities, as it opens the door to a whole lot more people, and therefore a whole lot more toxic people, and since negativity stands out, they have a much greater impact. Having the permanent ban system is if anything more important in a FTP game to maintain some semblance of integrity in the community. OCE LoL already faces the perception of being one of the most toxic servers, the perma bans help to reduce this.","replies":[{"poster":"Willi God","date":"2016-02-08T08:22:04.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I don't know why this game refers to \"toxic players\" \"tooooooxic plaaayers\" it is a TOXIC GAME. it's like people seem to think there are these people that just play games to solely abuse people, the most toxic people on LoL are often great community players on many other games, this is why this game will always be toxic, because riot blames it's community instead of itself, it's ironic really because they expect people to not blame their teams in ranked then literally blame their community when the community is just a batch of ordinary people. the only X factor is the game itself.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-02-08T08:50:33.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"^ this i am toxic as fuck in league.\n\nI literally RUN a gaming community for other games and am loved within said community as the funky uncle type admin.\n\nThe one that runs heaps of events and games to make people happy.\n\nAlong with being a forum mod for a small time software company which requires a professional personality.\n\nBut boot me up some league ranked and ill chew out the first mistake i see because this game is so fucking easy but people still manage to mess up.","replies":[{"poster":"Willi God","date":"2016-02-08T10:52:18.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I love how Riot just throws around the word toxic and labels people as it yet League more often then not is the only game those players are 'toxic' in.

YOU and you alone are responsible for your behaviour, and if you don't want to be, then accept that you are going to be held accountable for your actions and face punishments.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Willi God","date":"2016-02-08T08:11:02.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"It boggles my mind why they ban so many people, the game was toxic 4 years ago (before they banned or chat restricted people), and it's just as if not more toxic now, it isn't the players that are toxic, it's the game. Voice comms would help solve this issue (People are always going to be less abusive/toxic if talking via voice then via chat where it is dehumanized, it's just human nature.) \n\nBasically Riot need to stop banning players and realise the game is the catalyst that causes toxicity and steps should be made to try and make the game less rage inducing then just slapping bans left right and centre thinking it will somehow make people rage less in a game that is simply put. Rage inducing. (btw I've never been banned from the game, so don't say I'm just saying this because I've been banned as I never have been.)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-08T08:18:26.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The toxicity in game in my experience has improved drastically. And those that face perma bans have to be toxic consistently to make it that far in the system. They don't ban nearly as many people as you might think, but people don't go around posting \"Hey guys I didn't get banned today\".\n\nVoice comms would make things much MUCH worse. If you need any evidence of that look at the toxicity in DotA. When the toxicity is there, the voice chat makes the experience much much worse than when it is just text. Would you rather get all caps yelling at you or an actual person screaming in your ear?\n\nIf Riot stops banning players then those that ARE deterred by the threat of punishment will no longer have a reason to check their behaviour. Teamwork games like League often have more toxicity than largely solo experiences, especially in small scale, but WoW or ESO don't ban PUG raids/trials because you get toxics in them now do they?\n\nSaying it's the games fault is like blaming a gun for shooting someone. We as players are responsible for our behaviour, and if we choose not to be then we have to be prepared to face the consequences of our actions, it's as simple as that.","replies":[{"poster":"Willi God","date":"2016-02-08T08:30:26.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'm just going to mute them chat or voice, so I'd rather have voice as less people would be toxic if voice communication was the primary form, but if mute weren't available for some reason I'd rather get flamed over a mic, I'm really not a sensitive person at all as far as abuse goes, what does infuriate me is when I'm trying to get a point across on chat with someone, or instruct my team of what to do, even if it is a nice team but I can see we need to do something to win it is infuriating that i don't have the tools to do it, and the reason I don't have said tools is because some emo teen is to sensitive to handle someone calling them a %%% over voice comms and also doesn't know how to mute. I really don't know why chat even exists come eo think about it, it's far to slow and inefficient to convey team strats or points, it only exists to flame and troll. I guess us adult gamers are at the mercy of 12 - 18 year olds who don't know where the mute button is.\n\nYou would really be surprised how many people are willing to communicate over mic that are often trolling or abusive in chat, and I really don't see the difference, you get told to kill urself over chat or mic (even tho a fraction of the people would say that on mic compared to chat) it just comes back the same solution mute them, or if you're in the mood have a bit of banter, but the mute option is always there, I mean in reality why do bans even exist you can literally ban them with one click of the button in game (mute). People need to realise the very large majority of toxicity stems from people losing games and be frustrated and voice comms directly helps to relieve some of that rage and frustration.\n\nLet's say I'm 15/2 and me entire teams negative, I'll be a lot less irritated if I can at least communicate with my team via voice, even if they don't have a mic (most people have mics these days) then if I didn't have a mic.\n\nI'll actually put a pic of my last ranked game on my smurf here, my Vlad said one negative thing at about 6 minutes in i immediately muted and went on to just carry the game, but I would have been a lot happier in that game had I had voice comms.\n\nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/121486654/200220855?tab=overview Here we go played this game 20 minutes literally every single person on my team is negative, I absolutely 1v5'd that game but this is the exact game where voice comms would be a blessing.

It isn't about being sensitive. If someone stole a friends phone would you say to them, oh you should have just been more careful with it get over it? Not only is that a dick move, but stealing a phone is still illegal.\n\nAs for voice chat, you can ignore text, ignoring someone screaming at you to go die isn't so easy and ruins games a lot faster. Bans exist to root out toxic behaviour and punish it. There is plenty of warning, and plenty of reasons to rectify problematic behaviour.\n\nIf we don't take responsibility for out actions then what does that make us?\n\nIf there weren't bans in this game the community would be a cesspool of toxicity and it would only get worse, cause any non toxic people would be driven away and only the negative would be left. Sure there are people who have bad games, but they aren't the ones getting banned. it's the ones who consistently demonstrate toxic behaviour that get banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Willi God","date":"2016-02-09T08:20:25.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"\" If someone stole a friends phone would you say to them, oh you should have just been more careful with it get over it? Not only is that a dick move, but stealing a phone is still illegal.\" I'm just going to stop and applaud you for a second, as you have crafted easily the worst analogy in the history of the Oceania boards.\n\nSure if my friend has a button that instantly tp'd the phone back to his pocket and shut the guy out of his life for ever then yea I'd say why are you bitching to me just press the button (that's the mute button btw)\n\nYou want people banned so you don't hear their abuse yet you LITERALLY HAVE A BUTTON THAT TAKES THREE SECONDS TO PRESS THAT STOPS YOU FROM EVER HEARING ANOTHER WORD FROM SAID PLAYER AGAIN. \n\nLeague is the only game you play? Who the fk is going to scream \"GO DIE, GO KILL YOURSELF!!!\" I have played thousands of hours of games with voice chat features and I can't recall someone ever screaming abuse at me, people don't say that over microphones what do people not grasp about this, this is why microphones would instantly lower toxicity to levels banning can NEVER achieve, telling someone to go kill themselves over chat is a world of difference to someone saying it over a microphone. it's basic fact that people will be more likely to abuse you over chat then voice to voice, and then even less chance face to face.\n\nRiot really should have some psychologists on their player communications team being a billion dollar company and they will tell you, voice chat will lower toxicity, on average, in every situation in every game in every facet of life, sure you might have the one wild card kid who gets abusive, and I'll tell you now it will be a fraction an absolute fraction of the time now, basically right now in every single game your team loses in ranked there will be abuse, it doesn't stem from hatred of the teammates, it stems from shear frustration of the game, people don't queue uop for league and are like \"I'm going to tell someone to kill themselves this game\" it comes from frustration, this is hard to explain over chat, if only we had voice comms Kappa. Just watch this video it just summarises the entire argument for voice comms, the ONLY argument anyone can bring to deny voice comms, is \"oh it's hard to ban people, or oh I'm sensitive and I don't want to get abused via voice\", League is probably the most toxic game in the world, yet it's one of the only competitive games in the world that DOESN'T have voice chat, every other game does, CSGO, DOTA, any random shooter like CoD or Halo or rainbow six siege, HOTS, they ALL have voice chat, they ALL have ranked system very very similar to League's, and they ALL have better communities, yes CoD's community is better then League at least as far as copping abuse goes and arguments.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n7KstfRzvs You can't defend not having voice chat in a team based game, you just can't. When are people going to realise and understand this, it doesn't matter how many people you ban if the GAME ITSELF is inherently frustrating and rage inducing, you will ALWAYS get arguments, and you will always get abuse. ALWAYS. Because it isn't the players, it's the game. Voice comms directly reduces frustration and increases team coordination, and if someone is going to say \"pings is enough\" no it isn't, every team used voice comms, because it logically makes you a better team, this game requires intricate levels of coordination, pings useful yes, but voice comms is essential. If you're still going to sit here and say that voice chat would create more toxicity, which is basically what you're saying, the only argument against voice comms is that it would make the game more toxic, which it wouldn't.\n\nIt's really frustrating arguing this with people because it's just so obvious voice chat should have been in the game four years ago, every single team based game like league of legends, csgo, dota, cod, rainbow six, battlefield, hots etc. etc. has voice comms, so all of these games they spend time, they spend money, they pay people to make them a voice chat system for their game because it takes a baboon with a rattle to understand that voice comms will make people less abusive and make the game more cohesive and enjoyable to play as a whole, for some unknown reason, league of legends is the only game company that for some reason has a complex that people just love to tell each other to kill themselves and to go get cancer over microphones, I am 20, I have been playing games with voice chat since i was 14 years old, NEVER have i been told to kill myself by anyone, do you want o know how many times I've been told to kill myself in league of legends over text chat? I've lost count, and nowadays I have people muted far before it gets to that point, if you take two people of equal levels of rage and frustration i will bet you anything that 90% of the time they will be less abusive over voice comms then if they were talking over text chat, not to mention the voice comms would almost definetley have lowered how angry this person got to being with, and then if someones is abusing you over a microphone like full on roid rage abusing you they are gonna vent their anger a lot faster over voice then chat. To summarise it, Rager A, will always be less abusive on voice comms, then the same Rager A on text chat.
