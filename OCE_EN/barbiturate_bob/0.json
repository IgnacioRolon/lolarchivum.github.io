He locked in a troll pick of Veigar jungle in a ranked game then proceeded to troll in the chat and claim our jungler stole his role. Fortunately it was a remake... However, I really doubt anything will be done? \n\nI of course reported the player but is pre game chat even taken into account here? I only managed to get a couple of screenshots unfortunately but the intent is quite obviously clear.\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/34b46a2708792afa2d102111e5f0508b\nhttps://gyazo.com/18a63bfdd8855dc333101b51b47132a9","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2018-02-17T00:26:04.813+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah so this behaviour is really bad, I think that stands by itself. As for your question on reports; pre-game chat is [recorded](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/lo1oZ0Pm-champ-select-reporting?comment=000000030000) and you can be punished for breaking the rules there just like you can in-game. The current recommendation though is that you report them normally, but leave a short description note outlining that this person was toxic in pre-game chat.\n\nIf you forgot to leave a short description note that's fine, just send [Riot Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) a quick report request with the evidence you provided here. Make sure you use the _\"I want to report abusive behavior, cheating, or a malicious link\"_ category.\n\nBest of luck :)","replies":[{"poster":"Evelynnie","date":"2018-02-17T00:59:48.595+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Just letting you know that sending it to Riot Support doesn't work.

But this the first I've heard that they're telling people they're not doing anything with reports. The report category is there after all, so they should be taking these reports seriously.\n\nDo you have a ticket ID, post, or screenshot of that message? I'd love to follow up with a few people and see what happened there.","replies":[{"poster":"Evelynnie","date":"2018-02-17T01:18:05.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://imgur.com/a/vZ0Kd\n\nI provided screenshots of the chats as well as giving timestamps for other areas in chat that I didn't manage to screenshot.

Although it does make sense that they didn't act on this case since report had already gone through the Instant Feedback System. \n\nRemember it's not like you get a harsher punishment or faster escalation because you sent it to Riot. They still have to abide by the same rules the Instant Feedback System has. So if the IFS had already dealt with it, there's no benefit to it being dealt with again.","replies":[{"poster":"Evelynnie","date":"2018-02-17T02:20:12.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, using the IFS, death threats are instant bannable. However the player in question is still playing on the account, even though he used flagged words/phrases, got reported with IFS, *and* got reported in a ticket.\n\nSince Riot refused to do anything based on a ticket and the flagging system is automated, everything rested on the IFS, which clearly hasn't worked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-17T14:21:11.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">That text you underlined is a bit weird\n\nWeirdly honest is all.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Evelynnie","date":"2018-02-16T20:00:34.595+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Unfortunately Riot doesn't care about that.
