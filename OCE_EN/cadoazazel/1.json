The Post Game Screen gives you less information than previously, you cant even tell if everyone was level 30 or if you had level 25 players in your game which you could tell just by mouseover with old client \n3. You cant check details on recently played players you played with against in a recently played tab next to social tab like you had in old client..... so unless you add people in post game screen you have to manually look up who was in game and type their name in rather than just being able to go to recently played with, view profile to see details of who you played with/against. \n4. No history of notifications , like you missed a queue message would stay there for you to see it later, that no longer viewable/exists..... \n5. Cant resize. \n6. Cant hide friends list. \n7. Its now harder to see if your daily win bonus is available \n8. Less information is given to you when a queue pops than previously. \n9. Changing region now closes the client, previous client was able to change region without restarting. \n10. New client lags badly\n11. Post game lobby no longer tells you in the chat window when people have left it.\n\nIts like riot outsourced the programming for this new client to India/China...\n\nBasic stuff thought they&#039;d add but havent\nTheres still no way to &quot;log out&quot; of client. \nTheres still no &quot;amount of damage shielded&quot; chart for shield supports to know how much they &quot;healed&quot; for.﻿\nYou cant hide offline people, hide mobile people,\nCant sort by rank (solo/duo or 5v5 ranks seperately sorted)\n\n\nim sure theres more stuff I haven&#039;t noticed yet.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-11-18T12:39:16.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah everything is like fuked tbh.
