I click the orange button to accept the Orianna champion shard, but for the gemstone, I can&#039;t press it because the queue pop&#039;ed and I entered game with a party. After the game, the Orianna shard was still there, but the gemstone wasn&#039;t.\r\nCan this please be looked into? There may be other bugs involving people using Hextech Crafting while in queue, or maybe it was just a one time glitch that honestly isn&#039;t that big of a deal for me.
