I liked it better when there was wind blowing and it looked 3d but in the alpha client it doesn&#039;t have that.  Everything else is stunning and i really enjoying the alpha client.","replies":[{"poster":"Dawn ZA","date":"2016-11-08T16:56:20.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I liked to see downloading per second, if we could see that again it would be great!

Even during champion select, while it's very aesthetically pleasing, a little more 3d elements would be fantastic. Making it too 2 dimensional gives the feel of playing a flash game on a browser and is a much less immersive experience.","replies":[{"poster":"wot","date":"2016-10-23T04:35:50.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that is what i'm going at","replies":[]}]}]}
