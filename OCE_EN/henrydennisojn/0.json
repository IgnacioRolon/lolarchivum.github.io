You think he's low but he's not or you think he's got alot of hp but he doesn't. You think you can't outfight him but you can or you think you can outfight but then you can't. It's really hard to judge vs a kled but he's not actually that strong though his ganks can be terrifying.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-13T06:39:42.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not to mention alot of people don't understand his kit or how to play him so both sides are a confused mess. He seems strong sometimes but weak other times but he's not really a stomping toplaner and I haven't had too much difficulty beating him in slapfights though he roams really well and I sometimes forget to ping mias. Also kled jungle just doesn't seem to have the sustain or clearspeed you would normally expect and it's rather underwhelming in the early game and he's pretty easy to invade.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-08-13T05:24:01.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kled can be countered by disengage champs fairly easily.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bradilz","date":"2016-08-15T00:08:29.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree with most people on this hes not OP hes just hard to counter I've been playing kled{{champion:240}}  since release and tend to win lane easy because they don't understand how to deal with him but I will give u a handy hint watch kleds second bar because once it is full he regains skaarl back so try and gank once he is dismounted because his moment speed is dropped by a lot and he become very venerable so have fun","replies":[]}]}
