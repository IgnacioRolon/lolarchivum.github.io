Firstly support is by far my favourite role and the only role in your game I still had interest in playing, so it saddens me to see these changes go through. I can&#039;t begin to imagine the reasoning behind this, whether it&#039;s targeted at the &quot;auto-filled&quot; players or the fact you guys can&#039;t  find a way (or can&#039;t be bothered) to stop other roles abusing the items. I&#039;m not here to plead or bargain in any way about these changes but to inform you that this is the last straw in a course of changes you have made to the game and will be removing the client from my computer after finish this message. I have lost all interest in the game and will no longer be playing as I feel it&#039;s a flat out waste of my time playing as this game never seems to bring me joy anymore, which is a real shame cause I do really love this game, if things change down the line I may start up again but I don&#039;t see that happening in the near future. I don&#039;t expect anyone to read this let alone respond, just makes me feel a little better that at least I tried to let someone know how I fell.\nAll the best guys and kind regards","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-01-24T05:01:06.914+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"Out with the old and in with the new","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2018-01-24T06:49:55.878+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"I highly doubt there are any new players coming to League right now lol","replies":[{"poster":"Chimeric","date":"2018-01-24T10:35:10.289+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm relatively new, but I'm not playing further for a variety of reasons - community general feels like a schoolyard and there isn't any actual games (in OCE) to play - it's mostly just queuing, and players dodging during champ selection/banning.

People take that a lot more seriously than normals so you should get better games. Dodging is not necessarily a bad thing. It's a small annoyance since you have to go back into queue. Some players can see that something isn't going to work, either your team comp is really bad or knows one of your team members is toxic. They themselves could be toxic and well that's one less toxic play you have to deal with.\nYou are queueing for one of the lowest popular queues so it's no suprise it feels like there are no games.\nYou're also just playing Soraka every game. One of the most non-interactive heroes in the game.\nTry a different role perhaps or if you do like support that much, expand your champion pool. Find something that's fun.\nYou've managed to grind to 30 and didn't give up prior so there must be something you enjoy.","replies":[{"poster":"Chimeric","date":"2018-01-24T11:08:48.310+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't play ranked. Don't own enough champs, don't have the matches to qualify, can't get the matches because everyone dodges. Most of my games (historically) are AI games, because I actually get to play them. I'm not about to purchase champions to get the 20 required, either. That's why I posted about being new - as the queue mechanism stands, what is there to encourage me to buy champs? \n\nIf I did buy the champs, I'm going to end up in ranked games with nearly all my experience in AI matches and the people you mention that take it seriously are just going to bitch and moan and then report me because I played badly. Seems pretty pointless.\n\nAt any rate, I've uninstalled.

Over the course of your leveling, free week rotations will let you try heroes so you know who you'll want to get and during this time you should've earned enough BE (Or IP if you leveled when it was that.) to buy them all\nPlaying so much AI then just spamming Soraka, it's no wonder you don't find the game enjoyable. These are probably two of the most boring things to do ever..\nIf queues are taking so long, just do something else while in queue? Watch Twitch/Youtube, play another game, check out dank memes, whatever.\nForget what people think, if they want to bitch just mute them. People are going to bitch no matter what level you're at or what game you play. People like to look for something else to blame other than themselves. Some dude could be 0/4 dying solo to enemy mid every time but will blame their jungler for it.\nIf they are reporting you for because you didn't play to their expected level that just backfires on them.

More players have been leaving or simply not playing as much this preseason or any time between season 5 to now. \n\nThere's a reason why all we see for League content is stream highlights, all the non pro players/high elo players have already quit the game due to how competitive it is compared to its fun factor.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-01-26T10:21:15.292+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is good point but I highly doubt riots numbers in this game have gone down since 2015 and this game is every growing and Iâ€™m sure there are more players joining than leaving resulting in an overall growth due to just the fact of league being that most popular game out there publicising itself to introduce new members... I got 5 or 6 friends that have picked league up these holidays and recently hit 30 and one even played ranked got silver so yes I believe older players are somewhat leaving which is expected in every game but the amount of new players is overcasting the amount leaving which is why riot games league of legends is growing in size still.","replies":[{"poster":"catch this work","date":"2018-01-31T12:58:10.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure, I can agree with this to an extent. But honestly new players are rather irritating since they don't understand any context behind game changes or game aspects in general. They don't understand why something is OP or UP they simply complain just for the hell of it. But that's besides the point. \n\nFurthermore, I also said that players are simply not playing as much anymore; veterans that is. This is because the game is just....not fun anymore, unless of course you participate in ranked and surpass your own stress threshold. \n\nFact of the matter is, the game isn't fun for veterans anymore since there are no unique/fun items to mess around with and champ designs are rather boring. Sure, new champs are great and everything, but older champs are constantly being reworked to suit the aesthetic, rather than staying in the game to remind everyone that that was how League once was. \n\nRiot is simply choosing to leave veteran players behind in favor of newer players, since that's where their marketing strategies are aimed at. This should never be the case since Riot promised in their early years that they would be a for the player company, similar to Bungie's approach as they loved their game. However, this has not been the case and we've seen Riot's corporate design rear its head over the past few years. They don't love their game for the sake of loving their game, they love the money it grants them.\n\nI said LoL is going to die if veteran players keep leaving because it's the veterans who keep a record of how the game once was and it provides newer players with guides as to how to play the game. Imagine if all of a sudden all the current pros quit the game, we'd lose access to many of the mainstream strategies to do with champions, builds and the overall game. This is what is happening for newer players, they're losing their experienced friends who can teach them and they're losing the context behind LoL as a whole.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-01-24T23:20:25.695+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ive always been a big and loyal fan of league, as far back as the end of season 2, when i started. I try to go the extra mile for the game, both by being an active personality on the boards, and fun and supportive in game. Over the past couple of years, Riot has been making decisions for the short term future of the game that in my opinion have sent the game on a downhill path, and these last few months have really been nails in the coffin.\n\nRecently I have started to wonder why I still bother.\nI feel like i'm playing the game, less because it's a really fun pastime, and more because it's an obligation due to how much money i've spent on it, the familiarity I have with my favourite champions, and because it's just habit that league is the game all my friends play together. \nI have long since stopped playing league when i'm on my own. And while I still do have fun playing league, almost every game now there are aspects of the game that crop up that are just really horrible, and don't actually need to be there.\n\nI'm not announcing my resignation from League or anything, but the game is not as fun as it once was, I think most of us, especially long term players, can agree wth that. \nAnd as huge lover of league of legends, its characters and universe, that hurts.\nSo I don't blame you for feeling how you do. Its sad to see yet another player go, but I understand why.\n\nIt seems like all Riot's decisions are made with only the short term view in mind, _\"We better change this champ, because they aren't good in **this meta**.\"_, _\"We better change items because in **this meta**, some champs are abusing them.\"_ They can only see as far as the current meta, no further.\nSupport items have been fine for years, and now because in the short time that this meta has been around, a couple of champs abuse them **BAM** no more support items. This way of balancing the game is not sustainable, and Riot can't seem to see that this constant state of change affects players too much.\n\n\nThey have made some really great strides forward over the last few years, for example new skins and champs have been fantastic and of such high quality. But the state of the game itself has deteriorated so much that it overshadows any good that they do.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-01-25T01:20:29.948+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"who the hell down voted this guy he's right{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2018-01-25T03:20:39.639+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"All the stupid Riot fanboys who lose their shit as soon as ANYTHING remotely negative against Riot is said, stupid idiots need to wake up.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-25T03:41:56.769+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"And the people that lose their shit anytime anything remotely positive about Riot is said?

If the majority of posts on the boards are people complaining about everything then I think it's more to do with the company then the player base. Sure some complaints are over-exaggerated, but they are never wrong. A good example is when Riot decides to make another stupid balance change which is obviously doesn't make sense and some guy goes to defend it without any kind of logical sense. He just sees something negative and thinks \"NO YOU ARE WRONG LEAVE MY RIOT ALONE\". \n\nShow me an example Seras of someone here on the boards here who is thanking or praising Riot and someone else decides to yell at them. I want to see a comment, because quite frankly I haven't seen any. Actually, I haven't seen ANY praising posts in the last few months, no one thanking or congratulating Riot at all.

Just as there are people who believe Riot have no flaws there are people who believe Riot are only flaws and are adamant about that, but there are also people who apply to every part of the spectrum in between who may have been the one to downvote.\n\nRemember that our boards doesn't have much of a community, so the people it attracts are people who have a problem, perceived or otherwise. People aren't going to bother posting \"Another year with no punishments thanks Riot!\" there's no point, but if someone gets banned it's a different story. Same goes for gameplay. If someone dislikes the state of top lane they will come for feedback, but if someone is happy with the state of it why would they unless there has been a specific change?\n\nPersonally I don't feel we have any more or less complaints on boards than we used to. I think some hold water and some not at all. I also see the exact same thing in the communities of any game. Overwatch is exactly the same, Mercy got nerfed and a whole bunch of Mercy mains were up in arms about it, but there were also a whole bunch of less vocal Mercy mains who thought the changes were either fine or deserved. Same goes for PB over there.\n\nWhat doesn't make sense to you, makes sense to someone else. There are certain people here who's opinions completely and utterly baffle me, but obviously it makes sense to them somehow or they wouldn't have arrived at that opinion. Defending someone or something without all the information is shortsighted, but so is hating on it. \n\nA significant portion of the regular boards community (on *both* sides) have a bad habit of consistently dismissing the opinions of others simply because they disagree, and we're all guilty of it to some degree. Whoever chose to downvote that post obviously disagreed with the content in some manner, yet you immediately labelled them as someone who thinks Riot are saints and can do no wrong based entirely on *a single downvote*.\n\nI had people following me around for weeks yelling at me about how wrong I was because I agreed with x change that Riot made, and why? Because I disagreed with them? It only stopped when I stopped engaging entirely. So *yes* there are people on both sides of that.

If they cannot provide a reason, then their opinion is invalid. It's like saying \"Fruit is bad for you\" \"Why?\" \"Just because it is!\". They can't provide a reason for why fruit is bad, therefore we can assume fruit is good for you because the people that think so can provide a reason for it.

If I disagree with something, should I be obligated to provide an essay response for why? \n\nDon't get me wrong, I much prefer when people provide at least a basic reason, but say another commenter has already expressed your opinion? Or maybe you've expressed your opinion recently on a similar post. Should we have 100 different posts with the same three or four sets of content, or should we have one or two that add value, and simply upvote and downvote to express our agreement or disagreement with the rest?\n\nSome people also just don't want to be pulled into the drama of the more controversial posts, but still want to have their say, which is where an anonymous system like voting is incredibly valuable.\n\nJust because someone chooses to downvote, instead of comment, doesn't mean their opinion is invalid. Maybe it's not the best thought out, but they're entitled to their opinion same as anyone else, just as you are entitled to disagree with them. Telling them they're idiots that need to wake up doesn't solve anything, it only makes them dismiss your opinion. If you really want to change someone's mind the best thing you can do is try to understand where they are coming from, and also understand that you might not be able to. \n\nIt's fine to think someone is wrong, people disagree all the time, but just because you think they're wrong, doesn't mean they are, and doesn't mean their opinion is invalid. Especially when it comes to unquantifiable things like player behaviour.\n\nTroll votes are different of course, and we can disable votes if we see it becoming a problem, but we really only do so sparingly. Unless something has hundreds of votes the people here tend to take it upon themselves to counter unnatural amounts of upvotes.\n\nBelieve me, I understand the frustration of disagreeing with people here, we have some polar opposites here, but letting yourself get so biased only hurts you in the end. It leads you to make false or misleading assumptions instead of taking things as they are and really only adds to the frustration because a general statement (or in this case a downvote) can feel like an attack.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-25T08:36:17.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Recently I have started to wonder why I still bother.\nI feel like i'm playing the game, less because it's a really fun pastime, and more because it's an obligation due to how much money i've spent on it, the familiarity I have with my favourite champions, and because it's just habit that league is the game all my friends play together.\nI have long since stopped playing league when i'm on my own.
