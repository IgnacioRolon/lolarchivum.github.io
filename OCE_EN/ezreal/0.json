This has given me an opportunity to work on just about every aspect of game design.  Most of you would know me by the champs I've worked on (roughly 30-40 including Ahri, Blitzcrank, Nocturne, Kog'Maw, Sona, and a few more).  Now I'm working as Live Design Lead with an awesome team, all the while looking for opportunities to make current champions more strategically viable.\n\nI'll be trolling this thread for the next hour to respond to as many questions as I can!  Sound dangerous?\n\nEdit 1: 20 minutes to go before I need to teach a Denewbification class.  It's been a blast, so make sure to get in your last minute questions!\n\nEdit 2: That's it from me for now.

Understandably it's a great spell from an active play and spectator perspective as it encourages a lot of proactive play and great reactive play. But I feel that it's completely unbalanced as a summoner spell, especially when it's always chosen (minus a few niche situations like Olaf).\n\nFrom a design space perspective what are your thoughts on the (choose 1 summoner + flash) situation?\n\nDo you think it is healthy for the game?\n\nIs this something that Riot wants to change in the longer term future?\n\nBtw: thanks for signing my keyboard last year :)","replies":[{"poster":"Ezreal","date":"2015-02-24T00:30:49.396+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"TBH, this is something that we have tried to change multiple times over the years.  However, as time has gone on, we have come to peace that Flash is an integral part of League of Legends.  Many characters could not operate without it, so nerfing it into oblivion would have major balance implications.  I would argue that it would also be hard to buff other spells up to it's power level (imagine how much damage Ignite would have to do in order to pick it over Flash).  \n\nOne idea would be to make it a double spell (i.e. picking flash takes up both of your summoner skill slots).  Though honestly, I don't actually think that would make LoL a more fun game.  At which point we have to ask ourselves the question, does Flash really need to be balanced vs the other summoner spells?","replies":[{"poster":"grandjason","date":"2015-02-24T01:05:30.162+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The inner game critique in me is a little sad about this. I would have loved to see some new interesting builds that used different setups like Tele/Ghost.

Do not you think champions like katarina, Kassadin, Nidalee, Ahri, fizz, Heimerdinger, . morgana etc. would be less problematic ?? For me it is an object, without any ad counterpart, which allows not only to defend himself (the purpose with which it was created, I think) but also to increase the snowball effect (especially with katarina, Kassadin) of champs, in fact even if they  made mistakes and were taken into foul, they take refuge in zhonya continuing to increase the snowball effect. For me zhonya should offer you a defense, but not with that offensive potential. Can you imagine an object that has 80 ad, 50 of armor and an activable which makes immortal an ad  champ? And Why cooldown still work during the activation (freezes the time) ?? Only to allow  Kassadin to use the combo R + q + w + e + Zhonya and r away ??
