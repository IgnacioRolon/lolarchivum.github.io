I had a ranked team a little while back and loved it, but it broke up, and I'm looking for a new team. Never really enjoyed solo q, so haven't climbed the ladder, but no teams here seem to want to take bronzies. Can play many champs in all roles. Not that great in jungle (my champ pool seemed to get shafted this season, lol).
