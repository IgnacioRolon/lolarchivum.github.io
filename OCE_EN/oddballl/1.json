So we had 2 jungle. I let him go one way and I went another. I went tanky and he went assassin. It totally worked. We won! \n\nMy best game though was when some guy locked in mid after my friend called first, so we both went mid with him as a troll. 3 mid. We won!!!! \n\nWhat about you?","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-03-28T18:45:10.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was first pick mid in ranked so the jg offered to swap to avoid counter play.
