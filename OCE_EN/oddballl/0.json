Doesn&#039;t matter what&#039;s going on with the rest of the team or the fights around dragon, etc. He just split pushes mindlessly. The sad thing is, he wins because if you ignore him for a moment because your team needs you, he gets what he wants. \n\nHow do you stop him? The longer the game goes the stronger he gets, till you need two people to keep him away. Doesn&#039;t matter how many times he dies either. He doesn't care if he feeds. Killing him doesn't solve the problem. It's a dull as dishwater strategy and it works, thus making the game un-fun.
