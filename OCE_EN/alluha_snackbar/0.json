If he doesn&#039;t get a certain champion in champ select he often intentionally feeds then flames the whole team. He is hashinshin in oceania but with worse mechanics. I strongly recommend riot looks deeply into this. He also is a Yasuo  and Riven main with over 300 k mastery points on yasuo.\nThank you, Alluha Snackbar. Also he flames the jungler as he dies 1v1 to another top laner.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-11T07:01:41.001+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't name and shame on the boards.
