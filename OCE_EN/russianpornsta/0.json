Worst case please extend the time till 5am or 6am as a prolonged trial.\r\n\r\nthank you\r\n\r\nyours kindly.","replies":[{"poster":"Daejel","date":"2015-03-22T21:13:06.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not the quantity but the quality of players being the reason for the downtime. Matching bronzies with gold players wouldn't be a good thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2015-03-23T07:04:41.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, the wait times would be horrendous. It is already pretty crappy having to wait 10+ minutes to get into a games at 10am (plus all the que dodging that happens before ACTUALLY getting into a game). \n\nThis is also coming from me, someone in bronze, with the highest percentage of players in their tier to be matched up against at any one point in time.","replies":[{"poster":"Luneth","date":"2015-10-04T11:35:24.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"<3｡◕‿‿◕｡","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RebirthKnight","date":"2015-08-29T15:41:58.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was thinking the same thing here. I am at uni on most nights and when I get back home I would like to play a game before I go to bed.

So weird the cut of times, 4am in AU is 6am here in NZ, ranked essentially doesn't come back up till 10am which is really inconvenient.\nEven if it does get worse, I would rather have longer queue times or shittier matchmaking than not being able to play at all.","replies":[]}]}
