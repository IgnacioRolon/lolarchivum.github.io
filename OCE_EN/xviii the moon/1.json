The Item Sets are in JSON, which is easily extractable and then convertable into an array, but due to all the garbled text around it, it'll never be properly searchable (unless I start doing some magic with it).\n\nI was then planning to use the Riot API to create a JSON file which would ship with the application (and would be updated when needed).\n\nYou say they're planning on changing how it works soon, do you have a source of that?

[Here's the official announcement on the NA site.](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/patcher-landing-page-visual-refresh-pbe) There's a lot of yibber yabber about it if you are curious, but I'll just block quote the most relevant parts here.\n\n> Let's start with a quick definition: when we talk about \"the client,\" we're speaking to the technology ecosystem that supports your pre-game experience. Each interaction you have while getting ready for a match is built on a base of interconnected systems, all of which work in concert to get you into your games.\n\n>As a result, maintaining League's stability outweighs almost every other priority we have when making changes. Before we can tackle big feature changes, we need to make sure any core technology that we're introducing is robust enough to get the job done. With that in mind, we chose our first targets by looking for the least risky pieces of the client to update. The look and feel of the patcher and the client landing page emerged as choices that let us introduce new tech, minimize risk and deliver some neat stuff.\n\n>Our first few releases will be starting points that'll provide insight into how we should update additional systems. We'll be refining and improving the pre-game experience as we go, which allows us to safely improve the client over time. \n\nAnd that is eventually followed by:\n\n>Overall, your pre-game experience won’t change too much with this first release. The actual patching process is still the same, so don't expect performance gains or increased download speeds. Additionally, you’ll still be using the same mastery interface, store, chat system, etc. While our end-goal is to deliver you an improved pre-game experience, our biggest priority is making sure we continue to provide a reliable and stable client and game.\n\nWhile they haven't explicitly announced that they'll be changing how the masteries, runes and item sets (basically, everything considered to be \"parchment\" in the coding (the parts of the client that are made to look as though they're on an ancient piece of paper, such as runes, masteries, leagues and item sets)), they have **heavily implied** that they want to update it Soon(tm).\n\n>While this technology won’t noticeably change your pre-game experience, it will help us plan our future updates.\n\nThe announcement was written by ventropy around August last year.","replies":[{"poster":"XVIII The Moon","date":"2015-02-20T04:56:35.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds very promising.
