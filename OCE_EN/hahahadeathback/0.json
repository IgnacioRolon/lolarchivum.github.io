It&#039;s the same method used right now except a small additional feature for Summoners to experience. As we know, the LeaverBuster system puts you into a timer of 20 minutes (Yes, its pretty annoying to stay 20 minutes).\r\nNow just imagine, these are some situations you might go through.\r\n1. A summoner goes through the Timer and joins the queue. Finally, he accepts the game but his prompted with the warning &quot;Active Game Not Found&quot;. This can be caused due to minor issues either with Riot or your ISP.\r\n2. A Summoner Forgets to Accept the game or accidentally clicks on Decline (This is a very rare situation when some people forget about the leaver queue) \r\n3. Summoner Accidentally quits the Queue to invite one of his/her friend(s) and unfortunately forgets the fact that he was in the leaver queue\r\n(Some of the situations above might be stupid but Yes, it happens to many people)\r\n\r\nNow getting in these situations is one of the most annoying things which could happen. This is where my solution comes in. Riot can implement a new solution as  in case this situation occurs, the Summoner would be able to rejoin the queue without being prompted by the LeaverBuster timer. Yes, it might sound stupid because summoners can keep the LeaverBuster open at times they don&#039;t play and when they play they can straight away join the queue. This is the reason why i thought of allowing the Summoner to rejoin back to the queue within the next 5 minutes or else they would be prompted again with the LeaverBuster Timer. \r\n\r\nBasically what im trying to show is that If a summoner is put on the LeaverBuster system, and unfortunately a situation occurs where they actually left the queue, they would be able to join the queue again without being prompted by the LeaverBuster within the next 5 minutes or else they should go through the LeaverBuster timer again.\r\n\r\nThis is just a solution i think would be cool if Riot implemented it on League of Legends.\r\nFeel free to comment below what you think about it and Please mind my English Grammar skills.","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-06-13T00:45:43.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait a second.\nThe aim of Leaverbuster isn't to randomly annoy leavers (although, hey, we'd all like it). it's to make them realize something is wrong, either behaviourally or technically.\nIf they have a technical problem, they should fix it, not get workarounds to still get into the game.\nAs for 2 and 3... I guess 2 might have a point.

There are many other cases which eventually leads you to not Accept the queue, and the fact that you already stayed 20 Minutes can mean that you can have at least about 3 minutes to rejoin the queue without being prompted? It's not all about trolls aye cause some ISP's have problems with their systems which is not totally related to the subject. But if players have like a 3-5 minutes time to rejoin back to the queue, it would give them the punishment needed, in addition, it would also be a more useful sort of LeaverBuster for those who have problems within the time. Even the pause queue method like @TeCoolMage mentioned would be useful in the similar way as in the sense Summoners can Pause the queue and they will be put on a timer for like 10 minutes pause time if not it will return back to the queue or you can just directly resume back to the queue.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
