Imagine if you see a completely melee champ like Darius and think 'I can kite him', then he suddenly Blitz pulls you, Morg roots you, then Cho' Ult's you. That is not fun. It means you have literally 0 idea of what's going to happen for most of the game. Every time you would see a champ you have to think 'crap, what did he have again?'\n\nYou think it's fun on paper but I assure you that in game your first reaction won't be 'haha that's funny' it'll be 'wow X is broken'.","replies":[{"poster":"TechnoFlame","date":"2015-08-26T05:58:35.083+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"explain to me this, how do we adapt every game to a playstyle, belive it or not are memorys are actually really good because there is over 136 champions we all know there abils and roles off by heart we know their splashes we remember every aspect of league so it is do able","replies":[{"poster":"Lonely Flame","date":"2015-08-26T07:38:20.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So first off, I'm just going to say I'm assuming you're a troll so after this I'm done. There's 126 champs in League as of Tahm.\n\n...Did you even read what I said? Do you even know what YOU just said? You agreed with me. I said that if you see a melee champ like Darius you know what his kit is so you adapt your playstyle around that. And the reason you know what that kit is is because **it stays the same**. If you go into 100 games of League, Darius kit will be exactly the same unless Riot have made a massive announcement that it is changing eg what happened recently. \n\nIf you suddenly have a Darius with a bunch of ranged abilities it doesn't work because you know Darius is meant to be a melee champ. If you went into your next game and Darius came back to life after you killed him because he has a Sion passive it doesn't work because Darius doesn't have that ability.\n\nThis idea WILL. NEVER. HAPPEN. The people who think/want this will happen have no understanding of how a game like League actually works.","replies":[{"poster":"TechnoFlame","date":"2015-08-27T06:42:16.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"yet still dude we know every ability in the league off by heart so it wouldnt hurt too much also im not trolling, i mean its like a sandbox but with abilites like maing your own champ from the league anyway man it would be cool to play i mean u could have blitz pull  veigar w blitz e and blitz r with aatrox passive.... it would be fun if you think of it because they have to  be cautios of your kit iswell sooo","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2015-09-14T11:01:27.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess one might say that got a bit \"heated\"\n:D","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2015-09-12T08:21:37.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While this would be fun, I would have to agree with everyone in the discussion. This would be way too OP, I mean i walk up to a Diana expecting to get assassinated already, if she had a Lux ult for her Q, that would be insane.\n\nA slightly more likely game mode would be something like this:\nChoose your champion, make their Q another champion's Q, make their E another champions E, make their W another champion's W, but keep their passive and ultimate the same, and above their health bar or in their stats it would show their chosen abilities signed spot and what champion it is from (face art).\nBecause if i can't make predictions as to what abilities are on what role with what cooldowns, do they have four ults on 60 second cooldowns or all 5 second cooldown cc chains. Too crazy but if you added a level of predictablity or knowledge of how the enemy can use their abilities, it might work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thae","date":"2015-09-02T11:16:15.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lux snare morg snare zyra snare lux ult","replies":[]},{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2015-08-25T21:43:55.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be fucking hilarious.
