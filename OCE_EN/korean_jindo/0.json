But he blamed me first, and he induced me to swear him. If you check that previous game, you can see his intentional feeding, and he just blamed me. And then, after game he just reported me with his friend. You guys gotta check that game again and sort out this problem. He was so negative in the game, and I got penalty because I blamed him? I think that is pretty unfair. I hope you guys check that game again.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2017-09-24T12:49:43.124+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You must understand that you are judged purely on your own actions.

No body is afraid of chat bans. yet they certainly tuck their tail between their legs and come to the boards to complain when they get 14 day banned.\n\n\nHarsher punishments like this might actually change the way OCE behaves, and hopfully toxic players learn and improve from it.","replies":[{"poster":"Korean Jindo","date":"2017-09-24T12:36:43.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well.. I think if I play games with chat ban, I can't react with any offensive comments. So, that's gonna be a good chance to learn how to ignore toxic players and offensive comments. If I blamed them with no reasons, it's pretty fair to get 14 bans. But this time they started first, and they induced to swear them. Also, it's my first time, so I think just chat ban is pretty enough for me and that will be helpful to prevent next time happening.","replies":[{"poster":"Fruitsalad","date":"2017-09-24T12:41:14.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You expected a chat ban, and got a 14 day instead.\n\nthat speaks volumes. it says you weren't concerned with the chat ban.. because your behaviour wouldn't change and you could still cause damage with the chat ban active regardless.\n\nwith a 14 day ban. you have time to think and reflect. you have no control over the situation and you are denied the privilege of  interacting with others, its also riots way of saying. we've reviewed your entire history. you one of the worst of the toxic players.

But if you check my history it didn't happen before ( I started to play this game since season 5).It was my first mistake in my life. Seriously, if you give me one more chance(a chat ban), I won't make this happening anymore. If it happens again, you can ban my account permanently. Also, it can't not be the excuse, but English is my second language and it's not really good. So, I just tried to argue them, and I just sword them. But I just want you to know that my actual purpose wasn't a personal attack.  Anyway, this happening was 100% my fault and it won't be happened again.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mı Ke","date":"2017-09-24T11:24:17.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well\nFirstly, swearing your teammates equivalently means that you are using abusive language \nIf your teammate somehow did bad, you could have smartly done by muting them and focusing on your own gameplay.
