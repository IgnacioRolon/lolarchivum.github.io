I have also scored 10/1/16 on support malphite in a team that had 59 deaths, and some other good score on malph awhile back. \n\nThis amumu score allowed liss to catch up to yasuo, own was owning her in lane. I then allowed bot and top to get back into the game. I took 3 dragons and a baron, and all but 1 turret and inhib. I think your system is extremely flawed, and needs a MASSIVE overhaul?","replies":[{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-06-16T09:21:51.753+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't get an s, better make a thread and cry bout it","replies":[{"poster":"KingDing","date":"2016-06-16T09:32:32.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Clearly you're another toxic moron that hangs about in the community.

The new whizzbang dynamic queue system, along with how they award scorecards, is beyond a joke. They compare your game to that of EVERYONE ELSE in the same region and give a score based on that, not on the fact you got the best score on the map in all areas and carried your retarded team, but if it wasn't as good as everyone else, including the master tier players who are almost always in premades and can allow one of their team to gain an easy S, than you get a lousy A or worse.\n\nTalking about premade teams? With all the rewards and how the dynamic queue works, going in as a solo players almost always restricts how well you can play and win.\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/ymNFgFVZ-sometimes-you-just-cant-climb - This guy, apparently a platinum 2 player on his main, can't even get a win on a new account due to how bad it is. And Riot just don't care. I have had games that I had average stats, got an A rank and a win. I have had games with much much better stats, I get an A rank and a lose. It's just a fucking lottery that we are losing in low rank.","replies":[{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-06-17T03:52:39.266+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe cause youre bad and dont know how to climb.\n {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"KingDing","date":"2016-06-19T06:12:32.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you heaps for your response.
