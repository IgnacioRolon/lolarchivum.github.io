Spikes up to 10k sometimes. Doesn&#039;t happen when just browsing and watching Youtube etc.\r\n\r\nI know this was an issue once when TPG or someone had some weird routing that was causing it. Is anyone else having these spikes?\r\n\r\nI&#039;m with TPG in Melbourne, running Win 10 with latest updates.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-24T10:37:31.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TPG NBN adelaide user here and I've been averaging 30 ping but with frequent lag spikes that go up to 800ms for the last few days.  Also running windows 10 with latest updates and I can usually stream youtube hd without any issues. The lag spikes are making it really hard to play consistently, I'll be ahead going for the kill and then dc and a few seconds later they got away or turned around and killed me because I was dc and wasn't aaing or using abilities to finish them off. Or I'll be trying to dodge a skillshot and then dc and I get hit, or towerdiving and I'll dc and die to tower. Or I'll try to use my q to finish off an enemy at range and it doesn't work and they manage to flash out of range even though I should have definitely killed them. Or even I'll be the junglers and I'll be clearing fine and then suddenly dc and red buff has just 80% to 0% killed me even though I'm like lvl15 full build shaco jungle. It's infuriating and I can't play ranked with this. The average ms is perfectly fine but with the spikes I can't play.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-25T03:56:47.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"update it's gotten much worse today. 8000ms. How can I play like this? I got executed by jungle camps like 4 times because I would just suddenly stop and stand still waiting to reconnect and lo and behold, the lvl8 malphite precinderhulk just got executed by wolves. Or when you're going to cross the map to gank bot and then dc for 3s and suddenly you've just gotten executed by an enemy tower (lucky nobody was around to get shutdown gold).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wast3land ","date":"2016-09-24T16:08:06.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make sure that a plane isn't flying over your house","replies":[]}]}
