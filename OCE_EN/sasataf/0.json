has *potentially* received a ban through use of third party websites (OP.GG, LOLKing etc.) by looking through their match history and seeing if there's a large enough gap between games that *might* indicate a ban. Of course, it also depends on what length of ban you're referring to. A 1 day ban is, likely, the easiest to identify as it is the shortest, on the other hand, though, one can never truly know if a player has been perma-banned or if they simply stopped playing for a very significant amount of time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-06-20T05:54:16.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nCurrently we have an old tribunal notification that notifies players when a toxic summoner they reported has been punished.

It's believed that the player had to be banned (not chat restricted) and you had to be the report that triggered the ban.\n\n _e.g. If someone reports a player before you, and then you report the same person, only the first player will receive the notification._\n\n So essentially the notification is really broken right now.\n\nSince this notification is a relic from the old tribunal, I'd imagine it will get remade when the upgraded tribunal is complete. **Lyte** said in the past he wanted to fix it since report feedback is so important.\n\nI hope this helps ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Sasataf","date":"2016-06-20T17:26:34.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, thanks man.
