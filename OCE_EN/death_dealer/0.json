I get i may not be the best at this game. but trying to climb is very difficult when u have a yorick jg. or akali jg. or J4 support. I am also getting alot of people in games lately who say. MY MAIN IS DIAMOND 3 IM BOOSTING. i copy and paste this is the report i send of as clear evidence they this is what they are either doing or just bragging about. I am just trying to climb. I think there needs to be a buffer. so if someone gets at least 70-80% reported that game. they be banned from ranked. so they can still play and learn form there mistakes bt stop ruining games in ranked. Ranked is my only problem and mostly everyone elses problem. my last games have been hell. and i fell im getting know where. so if others would like to give me advise. feel free. but if u post plain nonsense BS then you just go a prove my point about stupid people in this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-10-03T07:02:42.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey man, \nI think your attitude might be stopping you from climbing, not the off meta picks. \n\nYorick jg and J4 support are both extremely strong picks if played by people who know their kit (like any champion in any role tbh). I haven't seen an alkali jg since she was building tank earlier in the season, but from what I can remember its usually pretty good if you make up the lack of CC with your laners. \n\nI watch a lot of games in all elos, and I can tell you that the off meta picking doesn't stop there. I've seen challenger support ezreal, jungle ezreal, jungle orianna and even a top nami. You just have to deal with it, and have basic knowledge of what all the champions do so when something like this happens, you can synergise and make the most out of it. \n\nUnfortunately, it is that time of the year again when the boosters come out in force. Continue what you are doing by reporting players (pref with links to screenshots because copy-paste can be made up) so that they may have their accounts taken away from them. \n\nas for your recent match history, it looks like you are relatively inconsistent, indicating you are challenged by where you are right now. Overall, your CS really really needs improvement (check[ here](http://imgur.com/U0PCCY1) for a guide)\nAnother piece of advice would be to itemise vs what you are facing. If you are losing lane, build a little bit of resistance instead of continuing to rush damage. When you are playing support, build to utility items such as locket and randuins to support your team. \n\nJust little things like these will stack up and make such a difference. Dedicate some time to learning how to manage actives, learn what all the champions do, learn how to read team comps and make effective calls. In the end its all up to you wether you climb or not.","replies":[{"poster":"xDarkRavenx","date":"2016-10-03T16:13:31.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nami top by Dyrus and won that game?","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-10-04T04:47:56.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, one of my mates on this server.

The orianna jungle was in one of my games when I was silver (we won it btw). I've also had quite a few Ashe/Caitlyn supports (most of which we also won). What I'm saying, is that it won't stop you from climbing. Myself and a lot of my friends that have gone from bronze to gold+ have dealt with off meta picks much stranger than your examples, still managing to be successful in most of the games. It's a mental thing, rather than a \"omg my team is trash I can't carry\" thing.\n\nPlaying off meta picks isn't an Insta-lose. Bad teammates isn't an Insta-lose. It's hard to deal with, but once you have found a way to better yourself and deal with these efficiently climbing becomes easy. You will then plateau when you need to improve something else.\nAs soon as you let yourself become tilted, or you stop trusting your team (which it sounds like you are doing from champ select), then it becomes an **insta-lose** - especially if someone starts all chatting and accusing people of trolling, asking for reports. \n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Supa Top","date":"2016-10-03T07:47:32.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i was going to send a new message but after reading this full message i found that i was going to touch on similar points, champion picks dont mean shit. like atm the best top laners are ants to my mundo and different picks.  while picks do influence play its mostly the player doing everything and from what your match history is saying you need to work on your basic player knowledge instead of blaming picks, get a base role so far it seems you got (SUP,MID,TOP,ADC) games if you narrow that down to a base 2 prio roles over 4 picks it will make it easier.you should pick a champ that you do well with and focus on your self asking for help with your own score and base mechanics over help with teamates :/ cause we cant change who you get paired with.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-10-04T00:03:05.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah dude dw about it too much like if your that worried duo - trio ranked man what you think may be a troll pick is actually super OP, For EG \n\nAnnie Sup,  Riven Sup, Mord Adc etc etc \n\ndepends how good the player is.. \n\nI remember once i thought this guy picked Ali Mid as a troll ended up being OP AF and we won.\n\nTo be safe recommend playing with mates","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2016-10-03T20:13:47.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Set up your own custom team to make sure there are no scrubs then?
