This is a second account - I have been low gold before on main account, regardless, its just a build to consider/try if you like. I like to play aggressive AD champs, it seems to do well in this meta (/my elo!) - Lee and Renekton are two champions I enjoy. This build seems to be strong all round, it seems to smooth out some early-game champions&#039; late games, and its ok if you don&#039;t win lane/get early gank gold in jungle (But don&#039;t want to go full tank). you just build HP-focused till you think you are happy building AD again. The aim of this build is not to 1shot but rather be tanky/sustainy enough to scrap with anyone, but have enough damage and mobility to dive squishier targets *at almost any point in the game*.\n\n\n Enough said, here&#039;s my experimental Hyper-Bruiser build.\n\n\nCore:\nSunfire Cloak / Cinderhulk Skirmishers Saber - not necessarily first. Slow burns - see the aim above.\nBlack Cleaver - CDR, mobility, Health, Armor Pen, AD, nuff said. I often build a part of this around the same time I&#039;m getting Bami&#039;s, and just make a decision if I want more tankiness (Sunfire/Cinder) completed first, or more damage.\nTitanic Hydra - Waveclear/Jungle clear, pick up Tiamat (Ahead) or Jaurim&#039;s (Behind) after Cleaver depending on how your game is going. \nRanduins Omen - Tankiness, AOE slow, still adds damage to T. Hydra.\n\nBoots:\nUsually Tabi or Mercs, but Lucidity or Swiftys can occasionally be nice depending on enemy champs.\n\n6th:\nMalmortius(?) - Magic resist part of build if needed, with nice enrage on low hp effect.\nBanshee/Visage(?) - Some tankier/survivability Magic Resist (also add to T. Hydra damage)\nFrozen Mallet(?) - *I&#039;m really far ahead and can afford more damage, and they have little to no Magic Damage*\nThornmail/Dead Mans Plate/Guardian Angel(?) - Situational\n\n\nI feel like this build is suited to almost any Toplane or Jungle AD bruiser (or anyone you can BUILD bruiser), except a few champions might do better with Trinity Force than Black Cleaver (Irelia, Xin Zhao, Hecarim, etc). \n\nJust a build I&#039;ve been trying out a fair bit recently, love it or hate it lemme know what you think, if you want!\n\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention 12-0-18 Masteries of your choice, but take the Grasp of the Undying - Resolve Tree Keystone - its disgusting with this build. Usual runes.","replies":[]}
