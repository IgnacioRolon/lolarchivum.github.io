The reports go through an automated system, which, from chat logs on the &quot;reform cards&quot; seems to be hypersensitive and picks up things like &quot;wtf&quot;, &quot;omg&quot;, and champion names..\r\n\r\nConsider some unreportable scenarios:\r\n\r\nChamp select: \r\nDuos/Trios/Quads lying for themselves or their friends to get the lane they wanted regardless of whether they called it, or anything at all.\r\nPeople troll picking, deliberately taking a champion not suited for the role open, or duo topping when whoever called top wants to solo.\r\n&quot;x or feed&quot;.\r\n\r\nLaning: \r\n&quot;Supports&quot; contesting every one of their ADC&#039;s CS because they didn&#039;t really want to support. These people usually ignore warding altogether, too.\r\nJunglers walking into lane and taking CS because they are annoyed about role/game so far.\r\n\r\nMid/Lategame: \r\nPeople suicide pushing, walking down lane farming creeps till someone comes and kills them. \r\nPeople abandoning lane because they fed like hell and don&#039;t want to deal with their lane any more.\r\nPeople blatantly ignoring that the other team is grouping and just farming empty lanes for nothing other than a few CS.\r\n\r\nAggravation: \r\nSome people seem to find the need to bait you into oblivion with nonstop trash talking if you show any sign of frustration, or speak in all chat at all. This seems to be done with the aim of getting you to say something that they can report. Sure, this is avoidable by muting them, but when you are having a bad game its not always easy to do.\r\n\r\nThen there is the fact that some people will report you for next to nothing - a recent game I played on this second account, I deliberately refrained from swearing even a single time, when my teammates did stupid things I just facepalmed IRL and said nothing. When they started blaming me for them losing fights 4v4, 4v3 and even 4v2, I grit my teeth and explained that I was top (solo killing their Jax toplane) and, quote, &quot;you lost a 4v2&quot;. This was the closest I came to flaming the entire game, and we eventually won (and im not trying to talk myself up, but it was my call that had us destroying the nexus with seconds to spare). And I thought it was a pretty well earned victory, and a good game, but a minute or so after I left champ select, with only the guy who tried to blame me for their lost fights left in the lobby, I get a report notification.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt probably wouldn&#039;t come as a surprise to people reading this, my main was permabanned recently, for verbal abuse. I was notified that I had received a (second in 2 years) 2week ban, a bit over a week into it, I tried logging on to check how long till I could play again on the account that I had a lot of skins/runes/almost all champions on, only to find that it had been cited again while inactive for a game before the 2week ban was implemented. And this was a permaban. The particular game cited for permaban, in champ select, one of a trio decided to lie for his friend who picked riven after I called top (I joined the room first; the riven said nothing at all), and after I picked Nasus, and the Riven changed to an ADC (also without saying anything, and of which we also already had one) the guy who tried to lie picked Thresh when jungle was the open slot, and decided he would duo top with me as Nasus. I said nothing at that point, thinking I would just see how it goes. The Thresh decides to take Relic Shield instead of Coin, and goes top and does his best to deny me q stacks. After starting about 4 fights that I didnt want (I was playing NASUS and this is levels 1-3) I fought the guy just so the Thresh would hopefully leave. Of course, after chasing him around for a while so I could Q him for the 6 stacks, Thresh flashes in just to deny me that too and take the kill. Extreme, dedicated aggravation. To make it worse, he wouldn&#039;t leave the lane, started farming and building AD. At this point I feel like most people would not be surprised if the person they are blatantly harassing got pissed off. Of course the whole trio and possibly the other guy reported me, and of course they incited the other team to report me &quot;report toxic nasus&quot; etc. This all because I stood up to a liar in champ select, and he was with friends.\r\n\r\nNow, I don&#039;t AFK in games when im not doing well. I don&#039;t troll pick in champ select, I don&#039;t go and try ruin someones game out of spite. I play all roles, and am happy enough to do so, ranked or normal games. My one &quot;toxic&quot; element that I can think of is that I sometimes swear at people when they really test my limits. And I&#039;ll admit, sometimes it can be pretty nasty. I know this is not ok, and I am working on it.. Its a habit, I guess, from the less reputable parts of the internet where words are often your only line of defense. Its not something Im proud of, and its something I do want to change. But should verbal abuse (swearing, really) in the face of extreme duress be a permaban offense? I don&#039;t think so, but Riot disagrees.\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR : Verbal abuse is being punished VERY SEVERELY while the factors that often cause it slip under the rug. I find the way some people play to be very often toxic, selfish, and overall repulsive to play with, and many of them seem to only be there to wind people up. Yet swearing (which you need the chat filter off to see) is singled out on par with intentional feeding and AFKing.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY SUGGESTION: \r\nMake Verbal Abuse/Offensive Language/Harassment punishments CHAT RESTRICTIONS OF INCREASING LENGTH. There are almost always aggravating circumstances when these occur. Very few people just completely go off at someone for no reason at all.\r\n\r\nLove from a Sad, Banned Summoner.","replies":[{"poster":"Truegolddigger","date":"2015-11-24T11:22:47.192+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest there should be some report system in game, that if it receives enough attention, a Rioter enters the game and sorts out whatever is wrong.\nRiot could do so many things to reduce toxic behaviour, but the sad truth is that Riot doesn't care.\nRiot is a business with a sole purpose of producing income.
