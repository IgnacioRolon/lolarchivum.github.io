They'll manually review the case and determine if the ban was made in error, and possibly reduce/remove the punishment based on that.\n\nLooking at the chat logs provided, I seriously doubt you'd be able to successfully appeal the punishment. There is a consistent negative behaviour, primarily using directed insults, even using certain terms that are taken more seriously (such as \"retard\" and \"cu-nt\"). The bottom line is that these logs would definitely result in some kind of punishment, whether that punishment would be a perma-ban would depend on your history, primarily if you had previously received a 14-day ban (if you haven't, you should have a reasonable case for a reduction).\n\nTo be clear, Riot's systems work on the premise that toxic behaviour isn't acceptable *full-stop*, meaning someone else breaking the rules doesn't give you leave to do the same. You are judged on your own behaviour (not the behaviour of others), and held accountable to that.","replies":[]}]}
