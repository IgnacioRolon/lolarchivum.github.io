Rhaast is Death, Aatrox is War, Varus&#039;s bow is Conquest, and the last, famine, hasn&#039;t been released yet. In pop culture, the Horsemen were changed slightly, removing the bow-wielding conquest in favour of the newer replacement, Pestilence. Since Riot has gone back to the bow, I&#039;d say we can probably expect the next two Darkin to be based around Famine and maybe even Pestilence, to give us the complete set for the total of five confirmed Darkin in existence. Now I&#039;m aware there is a hole or two in the theory, such as Kindred already representing Death, but all I&#039;m saying is that the Darkin Weapons represent the Four Horsemen, Five with the newly added Pestilence. Also, two of the three Darkin are tied to Ionia, with Aatrox&#039;s origins being unknown. Perhaps the next two Darkin will be Ionian as well, if they all came from the same place. Either way, it&#039;s interesting to see what Riot is doing with real-world mythology, even if Rhaast looks like Yas on roids.","replies":[{"poster":"SulkingKING","date":"2017-07-01T00:48:19.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, you got two of the three right.\n\nAatrox is the bringer war.\nRhaast is death bringer.\nThe Blight on Varus is brought on by the plague bringer.

That's just the mythos, as far as I've researched. All of the original depictions show Conquest, Pestilence is a relatively new addition, an newer version of the Horsemen. Still, considering that there's five Darkin, we might get both Pestilence and Famine and have a complete set of Five Horsemen, adding the newer one because why not.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-06-29T05:25:16.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhh ok I see.\n\nI hope we get a VU on Varus now.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
