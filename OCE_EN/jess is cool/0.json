If they banned it cause you aren't first pick and they don't want that champ on the enemy team, then it's not punishable. If they ban it because you've had a tactical disagreement and they really don't want you playing Poppy support, it can be a little rude but still not bannable. If they have indicated in any way that there is deliberate and malicious intent, then consistently banning intent picks for no valid (not punishable) reason can in fact get them punished.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-10-29T05:14:25.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's a little annoying though when you're 2nd pick and you want to pick a standard supports that fit the teamcomp and you main like alistair or janna and the premade part of your team bans 2 or 3 of your intended support picks and you're like comeon, save the bans for midlane or something. \n\nHaving 3 of your main support champs banned in a game is not nice, and I would have simply acquiesced had you simply requested I pick a different support, something more aggressive or pokey, or defensive peel, or utility, or engage, we support mains are used to having certain champions requested of us and we generally own and can play most supports. I can empathise that sometimes you need have had bad experiences with certain support champions, but a little communication would allow you to use those bans on midlane or jungle or something.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-10-29T05:21:14.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't say I've ever experienced that one myself, at most someone will steal or ban my Lulu or Nami but I've never seen three support bans and man that would suck. so I feel ya there. I suppose Ali and Janna are pretty high priority if you're gonna be banning supports though, so I can see it happening.\n\nAs for the communication side of things, I'd recommend trying to engage them, if you see someone ban one of your supports, ask your ADC what support or kind of support they want, do they want heals, versatility, tank, CC etc etc. It'll at the very least give you an idea of how they're going to play and how you need to adjust (even if they say nothing, it probably means they aren't going to be big on communication and you're just going to have to protect them as best you can). \n\ntl;dr If someone isn't communicating their intentions, best bet is to try and initiate communication and go from there.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JESS is COOL","date":"2016-11-03T02:32:24.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are 1st or 2nd pick and on Top lane I don't see any reason for allies to ban.\nSay Irelia/Riven for instance, someone just doesn't like her and bans her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-10-29T09:53:20.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had Quinn as my pick intent in probably 8 of my 10 ranked games and I was surprised that no one banned her.\n\nWorst I've had is when a first pick top locked her in, but they did pretty well so I can't complain there.\n\nBut anyway, Seras covered it pretty well I'd say. It's really only punishable is it's consistent banning of \"pick intent\" champs where there's malicious intentions. So banning champions with a high chance of being picked by the enemy team when your teams first (and maybe second/third, depending on pick order) pick isn't going to pick them isn't going to count as punishable. Whereas repeatedly banning champions to prevent allies using them *could* be a punishable offence (of course, you're not going to have much to back up your position if your four team mates all agree they don't want you playing the champion).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-10-29T01:54:50.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yodaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-10-29T01:47:36.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of the time it's accidental and at mid to low elo if I see a dumb pick like support singed, I'm going to ban it","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-10-29T00:51:35.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If i recall correctly, Riot have said it's not ban worthy, though that was a long while ago and may have changed since then.","replies":[]}]}
