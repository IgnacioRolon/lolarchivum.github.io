Another gruelling day of war and misery for those involved as the two states clashed yet again in a way that was becoming sadly another average day for the soldiers involved.\r\n\r\n**&lsquo;My heart and sword always for Demacia&rsquo;**\r\n\r\nGaren Crownguard, the Might of Demacia, surveyed the battlefield ahead of him, a contingent of thousands of Noxians arrayed before him, all fresh and eager for battle. His own men, of the Dauntless Vanguard, all tired and bloody from heavy fighting against the main bulwark of the Noxian advance were now the only available force to counter the Noxian reinforcements; as the rest of the army was exhausted and bled dry.\r\n\r\nThey were all that stood between the Noxians and the injured army.\r\n\r\nStill though, despite the daunting prospects ahead of him Garen&rsquo;s will didn&rsquo;t waver, nor did his grip on his blade as he straightened himself and started to stride forward&hellip;\r\n\r\nSlowly&hellip; Intently.\r\n\r\nHe didn&rsquo;t even need to look back to see his own men following him. After all they were the Dauntless Vanguard, the most skilled, the strongest, and the most loyal and brave men he could have ever asked for. The sounds of their synchronized marching, the scraping of steel as blades were drawn and shields clanged as the sound of marching boots filled the air.\r\n\r\n**&lsquo;Forge onward!&rsquo;**\r\n\r\nThe Noxian contingent looked amused as the paltry force of only a few hundred, all injured and tired, some with cracked shields, others chipped swords, or entirely missing their usual equipment, all slowly marched towards them to what was most certainly their doom.\r\n\r\nGaren growled, they&rsquo;d show them the might of Demacia soon enough, their arrogance would be their undoing. Even as they came closer the Noxians had come to a halt simply to watch for their amusement. Their archer&rsquo;s bows slung, their mage&rsquo;s staves lowered and their front ranks still languidly relaxed and underestimating them.\r\n\r\n**&lsquo;Stay resolute.&rsquo;**\r\n\r\nThey were outnumbered, and their enemies were still fresh, eager and fully supplied. It wasn&rsquo;t a mere serf army, raised and armed with rusty pitchforks and stones either&hellip; no. It was a well-trained, well-equipped Noxian force that could rival that of any Demacia&rsquo;s. Noxus wasn&rsquo;t their rival and largest threat for nothing after all.\r\n\r\nWell, perhaps they couldn&rsquo;t rival all of Demacia&rsquo;s men. After all, the Vanguard was now slowly eating up the distance between them steadily with each stride.\r\n\r\nSo what if their enemy had numbers? They&rsquo;d simply kill enough of them that their numbers would shatter.\r\n\r\nSo what if they were fresh and well rested? Their muscles would soon tire enough as they&rsquo;d fight and come to futility, their spirits would break in the end.\r\n\r\nSo what if they were fully equipped and replenished? His men could outfight any Noxian with a stick or even their own fists any day.\r\n\r\nSuch was Garen&rsquo;s and by extension, the Dauntless Vanguard&rsquo;s confidence that even in the face of such overwhelming odds they simply marched on and prepared to meet them.\r\n\r\n**&lsquo;Forward!&rsquo;**\r\n\r\nWhen they were only a couple hundred meters away from the enemy, they broke out into a sprint, even laden down with heavy armor and weaponry, some limping because of injuries, others breathing heavily from the relentless fighting&hellip; Even with fatigue threatening to drag them down into the sweet black depths of unconsciousness the Dauntless charged forward.\r\n\r\nThe Noxians having been slow in their preparations and not in the ready mindset were shocked and wasted a few seconds to respond with their arrows and magic, but in those few seconds the Demacians were already upon them.\r\n\r\n**&lsquo;Break their ranks!&rsquo;**\r\n\r\nGaren led the charge, and with a leap, smashed into the surprised front ranks of the Noxians. Wrenching out his sword from the deceased soldier beneath him, with both hands gripping his sword, he moved further into their ranks, spinning with powerful, heavy blows that cleaved apart many in a matter of seconds.\r\n\r\nThe Vanguard followed closely behind him and smashed into the stunned Noxian front block like a flood, breaking through and keeping up their momentum. Some using a dead or in some cases, still alive Noxian as a body shield against the enemy. Others picking up the Noxian&rsquo;s own weapons and shields before rushing off to join their comrades. The mage squadron of the Vanguard stood a little way back and exchanged magical volleys with the Noxian mages. Despite their fatigue, and near dry mana, these battle hardened mages in Runeterra knew how to use what little they had left to devastating effects. As they poured in their determination, anger and a bit of desperation to their magic, they shredded apart the Noxian war mages, whilst supporting their own.\r\n\r\n**&lsquo;I will not falter!&rsquo;**\r\n\r\nDespite the large casualties taken in the first few opening seconds of the battle, there were far more Noxians still alive than dead. Those who still lived rallied back together, as discipline reasserted itself over shock, surprise and frayed nerves.\r\n\r\nThe Noxian soldiers charged back in, now knowing not to underestimate the Demacians. The Noxian surviving mages, with their larger mana supplies, hurled back fireballs and lightning streaks stronger than those of the Demacians, and so the Dauntless charge that had swept in with ferocity, slowed as the Noxians reorganized themselves and threw themselves back into the fray.\r\n\r\n**&lsquo;For Demacia.&rsquo;**\r\n\r\nEven as the enemies&rsquo; rallied, and were no longer caught by surprise, Garen and his men still fought with grim determination and made slow headway. Yet, many couldn&#039;t fight nearly as well as if they&#039;d been fresh. Soldiers and mages alike incinerated as their spell shields broke under fire they could have held off easily if they had been fresh. However, the Demacians pressed on.\r\n\r\nA soldier&#039;s life in exchange for that of many of his foes, an awe-inspiring sight that showed the world why the Demacian military was considered one of the strongest in the world.\r\n\r\n**&lsquo;No matter your numbers, I will not yield.&rsquo;**\r\n\r\nBut reality was cruel. If the Dauntless Vanguard had been renewed and not so bone-weary they could have easily taken on such a large force and cut straight to the Noxian officer in charge and ended it all in one fell swoop.\r\n\r\nBut in this battle, the Noxians were now surrounding them as they cautiously attacked and prodded at the weakening Demacian force.\r\n\r\nGaren and his men were now fighting back to back as a growing circle of Noxians surrounded them at spear point.\r\n\r\nThere was now a lull in the battle as both sides gripped their weapons and awaited for whatever came next.\r\n\r\n**&lsquo;Show them the strength of Demacia&rsquo;**\r\n\r\nA gaggle of Noxian soldiers stepped to the side as a particularly well dressed Noxian stepped forward in well polished, ceremonial armor with a rich sash and sigil decorating his place in the Noxian hierarchy. When he spoke his voice was cultured and crisp.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Now here&rsquo;s someone who&rsquo;s been a thorn in our side for too long. But who would of thought that you&rsquo;d be in this position now? What a shame, High Command called you invincible, and now you kneel before me!&rdquo; the officer boasted to Garen.\r\n\r\nCompared to the fresh and pristine Noxian officer, Garen&rsquo;s face was covered in grime and blood, his eyes had bags under them, his armor, dented, scratched and dirty, his blade covered in black coagulating blood.\r\n\r\nHe gave a vicious grin to the officer as he gave back his reply.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Come forth, you will find honor in death!&rdquo; he roared.\r\n\r\nThe officer snarled and brandished his weapon, advancing with no more words to be said.\r\n\r\nThe officer, no doubt expected a long and arduous struggle with the mortal enemy of Noxus. He never even got the chance. The last thing he heard was &ldquo;JUSTICE!&rdquo; And a giant blade fell and splattered many Noxians underneath it\r\n\r\nA long red line stretched across another remaining portion of the Noxian forces followed by a giant laser that melted them into ashes.\r\n\r\nThe surviving Noxian forces&rsquo; morale broke and they fled the battlefield as the cavalry appeared, and ran down many of the survivors.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Cutting it a little close there aren&rsquo;t you Lux?&rdquo; Garen smiled at a beautiful approaching woman with shining blonde hair.\r\n\r\nShe merely grinned as she stood next to her brother and they watched Demacia&rsquo;s own reinforcements cut down the fleeing Noxians like scythe through wheat.\r\n\r\nAnd so ended another average day in Runeterra for those embroiled in the Noxus-Demacia war. But for Garen, every victory was another step to peace for his beloved nation.\r\n\r\n**&lsquo;We are the vanguard&rsquo;**","replies":[]}
