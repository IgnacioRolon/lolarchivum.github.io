So before you say just get good or deal with it, I&rsquo;am level 97 and yes I do have a life apart from League such as home commitments, school and work etc although my point today is about my ranked placements. By now you guys read upon at least 1 million of these post due to the mere unfairness players call it of leagues ranking system. I&rsquo;m currently doing my first ever placements and literally every single game my team will some how feed or int. Please just look at my profile if you wish. Name: Gliave\n\nI&rsquo;m currently 2 wins and 7 loses which on my behalf one of those games was 100% my fault as I fed hard though the rest of the games have been my teams fault. I&rsquo;m a one trick jungle main and I know what&rsquo;s the drill, blame the jungles that&rsquo;s what people do. Every game I will somehow get fed and get my team fed though they will somehow feed even more. I do everything right in my games, I gank lanes, get team members fed and other yet I still lose, I know a lot about team positioning, compositions, scaling and other you get the idea though as said I still lose and I don&rsquo;t want to get Bronze rank just in general but I definitely deserve at least Silver I - Gold III. \n\nI understand this sounds like a rant but some games I get gold players that are beyond trash and that is the reality. I know not everyone is perfect and I might seem a bit harsh and I&rsquo;m not perfect either but what is the expectation when your team gets fed though they feed even more than being fed?. What can you do?\n\nI&rsquo;m 100% open to any sort of comments, hate, positively you name it, I just want some idea of what I need to do to improve my game and get a better rank before I get more tilted in bronze rank and to play league again. This game is amazing but it&rsquo;s system is harsh and very unfair. Please leave some feedback if you can guys, turn this page into a discussion if you want. I just need some advice.\n\nCheers,","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-03-19T17:44:53.753+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right now you are vs around low silver . So expect to be placed silver 5 to silver 4. This is a common first rank for accounts and you need to go at least 7wins 3 losses to get gold first time","replies":[{"poster":"22 Caliber Rifle","date":"2018-03-19T22:25:17.011+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers mate this is good to know as a ranked first timer","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-03-19T15:19:29.897+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're feeding on jungle (which you admitted to) then yes. You do just need to \"get good\" as you pointed out. The ranked system is honest and true, if you get placed in a certain mmr its because thats what you deserve. Dont worry about the rank so much as a new player, you should be focusing on learning the game. Keep in mind you're not bad, you're just inexperienced. So when someone tells you that you're messing up, they probably are telling the truth. Try and learn from your mistakes and dont worry about losing too much. As long as you're learning the wins will eventually come.\n\nAs someone with actual gold3 mmr its a lot harder than it looks to climb to gold (i know diamonds and above will just call us trash but at the end of the day we're in the top 30%).  The more games you play the closer you will get to your true rank anyway, placements dont really mean too much. Keep in mind challenger players get placed in plat 1 at the start of every season so it is likely that you'll get placed lower than what you deserve to start off. \n\nFrom one jungle to another a lot of the jungle blame does have some truth to it as it is the role with the most freedom and responsibility. However if you actually know what you're doing and rationalize the decisions you make with yourself then you shouldn't have a problem ignoring the flame. I would suggest staying away from unique champions like warwick (warwick is a big nono imo for new junglers) as his kit will bait you into thinking you're a good player when you're probably playing him very sub par (not saying you specifically, i fell into the trap only playing ww and boosted myself to gold. When i played anything else it was an autoloss and my mmr tanked to s4. Now i've fixed it though). I would suggest playing junglers that can focus on the core mechanics on the game rather than relying on the mechanics of the champion you're playing, shyvana, jax, j4, sej, are very good and strong champions that will teach you how to play the game properly. \n\nThe main thing that separates a silver player from a gold player, especially in jungle, is macro play. You claim you have a lot of game knowledge but i can guarantee you that you are probably not making the right shot calls. I would suggest learning how to prioritise objectives during each stage of the game and knowing what stage the game is currently at. An easy indicator is to look at the most fed person items. 0-1 items are early, 2-3 is mid, 3+ is the late game (not including boots). Minion wave management is also a huge part of being successful in league and knowing what lanes you should be pushing/grouping in. Even as a jungler, during the mid/late games you shouldn't really be afk farming the jungle unless you're very behind. \n\nAnother huge point which alot of people dont actually think about is win conditions. You can't win a game if you have no win condition and if you dont have one in mind then you're not really playing to win. Now obviously the end goal to all of these is kill the nexus, but how you go about it can change. A brief list of win conditions in no particular order;\n\n1. 3 inhibs\n2. 2 inhibs + baron\n3. 1 inhib + 2nd baron (2nd baron is very strong)\n4. Team fight + 2 inhibs\n5. ACE\n6. Elder dragon + Contest open inhibs (forces team fights that you will win due to elder dragon)\n7. Flame the enemy team until they surrender?\n\nThats all i can think of off the top of my head. But hopefully this helps you out a bit.","replies":[{"poster":"22 Caliber Rifle","date":"2018-03-19T22:24:20.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is very constructive feedback Thnx, I totally get what you are saying but yet I am a very experienced jungler and do know what is going on when in game I believe it might be just an me difference between ranked and norms as I will full on destroy people in norms then ranked it’s a whole different story which is throwing my game off as for example sometimes in norms I will go against plat players which are genially bad and gold as well.\n\nIn terms of win conditions I prefer to to not get cocky about it. I know the goal of a game is to win but it isn’t always guaranteed and being fed and playing cocky isn’t a good combination and this is common with teams, example one game there was a 22/4/17 Jhin though he didn’t share kills a cross the team meaning we were essentially still dying due to lack of items while just played cocky and farmed and made bad decisions e.g. harassing jungler for been greedy for kills. \n\nCheers for the help anyway","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-03-20T01:13:03.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see how cockiness ever came into what i was saying?

(like myself when i play norms). If you're serious about climbing you should only be playing ranked, as that is the only true indication of if you're doing well or not.
