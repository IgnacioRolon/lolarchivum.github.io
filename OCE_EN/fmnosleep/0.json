I&#039;ve played only about 60 games so far so my luck hasn&#039;t averaged out but it&#039;s frustrating to lose games not necessarily because people might be bad but the lack of effort and defeatist attitude people have amongst other problems. I can count on maybe two hands going down my match history so far where there hasn&#039;t been someone giving up and goes ff@20 or afks at fountain despite them only dying twice, people playing full AP malphite for example(completely unviable cheese builds), not getting an ADC at all ( got a fiora and taric ADC who just fed all game then walks up trying to take my lane ), bots running down mid over and over and dying, premades who will never listen to calls or help you, constantly fighting even when behind, failed obvious jungle ganks who then stay mid leeching my exp putting my behind, supports who refuse to buy sightstone and tell you to buy it instead, people arguing with you with completely false information (such as only ADCs split push), people dying constantly before you even do your first jungle clear and expect you to make a difference running down half way across the map at lvl 2 to gank (exceptions such as lee sin excluded) and so many other things I&#039;m sure you have experienced or heard of yourself.\r\n\r\nI apologize for the long-winded rant as I&#039;m really here to look for a duo or more to play with as I can&#039;t patch all the holes in a 5 role team who puts in the effort (to some degree at least) to learn as I have (I read and watch guides, watch and listen to streams, analyze and learn strategy, macro etc watching live and replay matches of pros in korea, analyze and correct my own mistakes)\r\n\r\nI&#039;m currently bronze 1 getting matched with high silvers and beat them constantly with good scores even when my entire team is behind so I&#039;m 100% sure I will get higher with time if I stick to it but I can only take so much of the above while not being burned out and carry (only 3 of my winning games have I been carried) or refusing to capitalize on advantages so I would rather not gamble with teammates.\r\n\r\nI main mid (haven&#039;t lost my lane yet and I know what to do in team fights) atm and secondary top (still learning, particularly trading for specific matchups)\r\nI don&#039;t want anyone to take this post the wrong way (as I&#039;m sure some will) as I know I&#039;m not that good at the game in comparison to a lot of higher ranked people but I want to reach my peak and further improve my weaknesses knowing I got outmatched and not because of taric ADC or praying someone doesn&#039;t give up easy or any of that above.\r\n\r\nPlease put your IGN in the comments if you&#039;re interested","replies":[{"poster":"Starburst","date":"2016-05-04T09:49:04.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"freelo + coaching from xchally/master top/mid main, add if interested","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iverns Sperm","date":"2016-05-03T16:24:39.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doctor Jekyll\n\nTop/adc main.
