I think it would be much more convenient if even if someone declines, you still stay on the same page your in. It&#039;s certainly annoying when your looking at runes, seeing as its hard to remember what they look like and you have to read every one, especially if you aren&#039;t familiar with them. Pls look into this, if you haven&#039;t already. TY","replies":[]}
