I believe it's intended though, you should be earning a huge amount of LP per win currently, if your MMR is above where you were placed.\n\nAlso, was last season your first season by chance? Generally speaking, when you start from a fresh slate you will be placed higher than the next season (if you remain around the same rank). Because at the end of a season your MMR is NOT hard reset. It's just a soft reset. Where-as with a fresh account, it's a blank slate.","replies":[]}]}
