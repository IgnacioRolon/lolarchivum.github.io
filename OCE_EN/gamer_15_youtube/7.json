In my last post, I have said that my target was silver but that was just because I thought it was gonna take a while for me to reach silver. My goal was always gold. I have given up on adc although I met good support main through that post, he became inactive and I have had a break from adc for a while and when I tried to play jhin recently he seemed weak... So, now I am thinking of playing top/mid until I reach gold. I am not looking for a particular lane for the duo. I just want a duo partner who is confident and who wants and thinks he/she can reach gold before this season ends. I am confident I can play all lanes so the auto fill is not a problem for me and even in case I feed, I know how to get carried and my priorities. Here is the link to my op.gg\r\nhttps://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Gamer%2015%20YouTube\r\nAdd me in-game and tell me you have added me through boards once you come online. its obvious but I play adc and sup as well so if you are looking a duo partner in either lane still add me.\r\n\r\nSee you in Rift. Good Luck\r\n\r\n{{sticker:vlad-salute}}","replies":[{"poster":"hVRudolf","date":"2019-10-29T05:35:27.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ill duo with you! added you on hvrudolf","replies":[]}]}
