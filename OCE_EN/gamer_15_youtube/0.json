Looking For Jungle Adc or Sup duo","subforum":"Team Recruitment","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey, guys, I am a mid/ADC main and as I said in the title I am looking for a good jungle or adc or support duo partner. I don't prefer voice but I agree that it increases teamwork and I am willing to voice also this is just me dreaming but it would be cool if I find someone who punishes the opponent's mistakes like overextending and staying long in fights and also I expect the duo to not do them. I also play a few sup champions and am willing to support for an adc duo. The Goal is to reach Gold. See you in the Rift.\r\n\r\n(Also no tilting/flaming too much)\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Tsunemori Akane","date":"2019-11-06T00:41:50.195+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey I'm a sup main and willing to have a duo for ad/any, my main acc is 'Tsunemori Akane' which is plat 4 now but I have a second acc 'Fingerlove' as gold 2 tho, all the main champs can be checked in op.gg.\nAs I'm not a native English speaker so not having too much voice communication is prefect for me (at least for the duo starting).\nHaving too much time spend in TFT so I don't really think I could just jump back in plat ranking but at least can still doing well in lower tiers.\nMain acc was duo ranking with a mid player but I was doing solo q mostly in second acc which I hope can be the skill proof.\nPlaying aggro style in laning mostly but depends on the ad if him/her wouldn't follow up and wants to farm till the group fight.","replies":[{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2019-11-07T01:42:45.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HI Akane,\n\nI am currently at Gold 3, wishing to get Plat before season ends.
