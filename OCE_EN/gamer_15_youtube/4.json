Based solely on your OP.GG, I would put you around the rank you're currently at, however I can't know for certain since I have never seen you play.\n\nSecondly, you are playing sooooooooo many champions. Just stick to a few. You say you're good with Azir, yet your match-history says otherwise (not just the 0% win-rates, but the obscenely low KDAs, ie. you're dying way too much). If you want to quickly get out of Bronze, reduce your champion pool, play 2 roles, and get rid of the mechanically difficult champions such as Azir, Yasuo and Lee Sin. I would suggest continuing with Orianna Mid since she is strong right now and perhaps also adding Annie to your pool.\n\nAlso, how do you expect to climb with barely any games played in Ranked?\n\nAs for the \"Mid doesn't ping MIA\", this just further proves Bronze players don't look at their map or ward. If you did, you would have seen that Zed was MIA and a ward would have spotted him roaming.","replies":[{"poster":"Gamer 15 YouTube","date":"2017-12-19T19:18:22.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hifumi,realm=OCE,application-id=mR0UmRrp,discussion-id=1ZqHYTnn,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-12-04T22:05:51.068+0000)\n>\n> First off, what rank do you think you deserve?
