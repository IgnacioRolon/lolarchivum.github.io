I am a Silver 2 ADC main but I can't even say I main ADC coz I play all lanes and many champions (I don't one-trick, I have 75% win rate in 12 games as Ashe)\nI rarely do badly in games and the only things that make me mad are small mistakes like overstaying in their base after getting an inhib or tower and starting baron when their whole team is up.\nOn a side note, I am addicted to invading their JG level 1. Failed only once in the last 10 invades Ez Pz.\nAnd my highest elo is S1 70 LP. I am sure I can keep up with gold players.\nThe champions I am planning on playing in clash are Top {{champion:86}}  Jungle{{champion:11}} adc{{champion:22}} {{champion:202}} support{{champion:25}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:111}} mid is my last priority but i can play mid as {{champion:74}} {{champion:268}} \nI'm looking forward to meeting you in Rift.\n\n{{sticker:galio-happy}} {{sticker:garen-swing}}","replies":[]}
