I am the leader of our group. I was gold and almost platinum is s6. Recently I moved to Australia. Therefore, I start it in this account. What I'm trying to say is we usually start at midnight because we will have more chances to face old players. This is the reason, how I boost my teammates' skills and experiences. We don't care if we lost. What we care is what we learn back there and what strategy we can give in that kind of situation. We try our best and won't blame teammates, we encourage each other. you can add me, JLYFireGod. Ask me anything after you have my account. Wish you the best mate.","replies":[]}]}
