Haven&#039;t they ever won a &#039;push&#039; from behind?\r\nHow many games have I seen won from less than Half-life left on the Nexus, I hear you ask?  Well a lot more than you would think with a lot of dedicated _Abyss workers_ styling their craft for the LATE GAME.  How inconsiderate of the Juniors!\r\n\r\nThe points are in the late-game... masteries (S&#039;s) can be earnt there, too!\r\n{{champion:420}}","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-08-22T02:36:31.830+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I may speak the language of surrender (French), but I'm Australian.\n\nWe go down in the fight and not bitch out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2016-08-21T13:21:39.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well aram is a casual mode, if people surrender, most of the team obviously aren't having fun.\nOn the flip side, I hate surrenders, every game is winnable as long as the nexus isn't down.
