(Veigar more so since the update)\r\n\r\nI don't have a problem with the mechanics but I am finding that the skills I click never go off. I have been checking that I wasn't under any cc but still any skill shots I try to quickly fire off never work. I can do it perfectly fine on any other champion but I have problems with these two. \r\n\r\nAnother thing with brand I find his E, Conflagration, won't go off if they champion you are casting it on moves out of range while he is in the process of casting it.\r\n\r\nAlso Veigars Stun, the 0.75 makes it pretty useless. They have to be pretty dumb to not move out of the way and it makes them so easy to dodge his W now, which means goodbye combo. \r\n\r\nAnyone else having any of these problems?","replies":[{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-03-02T11:03:38.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"basically veigars stun is more for team fights where you are basically able to get 2-3 stuns off","replies":[{"poster":"Valens","date":"2015-03-02T12:57:09.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mar3thyu,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=erEba32X,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-03-02T11:03:38.929+0000)\n>\n> basically veigars stun is more for team fights where you are basically able to get 2-3 stuns off\n\nI understand that but a lot of people are able to miss getting stunned by moving a small bit and then running around inside it. Its a powerful stun but veigar looses what he is about from it having the delay.","replies":[{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-03-02T22:42:39.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Valens,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=erEba32X,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-03-02T12:57:09.654+0000)\n>\n> I understand that but a lot of people are able to miss getting stunned by moving a small bit and then running around inside it.
