Any account found to be violating this will be banned (though, Riot seems to be a bit more lenient in cases where people are sharing with others they live with).\n\n> how do you know if someone is account sharing?\n\nProbably the only way would be to look for variations in their match history. This includes champions used, binding of summoner spells (do they have flash on D or F?), statistics (K/D/A, CS, wards placed etc), item builds etc.\n\n> if someone is banned, how do you know they arent using a smurf?\n\nAs players, we don't. Riot (apparently) has some reliable systems when it comes to identifying smurf accounts, though. That said, there's never been any rule against the use of smurfs, even by players who've had accounts banned previously (if I'm not mistaken. This seems to be a bit of an oversight by Riot, they should be considering history of all accounts where possible). The issue with smurfs is not that they exist, but how they're used.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-02-17T08:12:45.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">As players, we don't.

Its usually pretty obvious when its someone using a smurf/account sharing, usually the locations of the smurf and the main stay the same.

There for you can not sell it because it's not yours to actually sell.\n\nRiot owns your account and anything to do with your account. Any money you spend on said account does not make it any more your account. \n\nRealistically and this is really stupid riot can ban your account simply because they left like it on the day. You have no ownership over your account what so ever.\n\nBasically you dump a shit tone of money into a LoL account that riot has said they will let you use until they decide not to let you use it any more.\n\nThe lua you agree to when making your account basically states that if you take the time to read it.","replies":[]}]}
