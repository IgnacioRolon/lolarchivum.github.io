We are actually in the process of fixing points 2 and 3 above, but as you can imagine leading into first show day, #1 is a little lower down the list right now. But definitely needs an update!!\n\nAppreciate the flag though and glad to hear that you are searching for more Esports content!","replies":[{"poster":"BurstFire303","date":"2017-01-19T09:08:21.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no worries happy to help","replies":[{"poster":"Koyotee","date":"2017-01-22T22:46:09.156+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know this will probably sound super cheesy, but just wanted to chime in and thank you BurstFire303 for the feedback.
