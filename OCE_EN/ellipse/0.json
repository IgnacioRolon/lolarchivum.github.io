I&#039;m dying to buy a skin for her, but don&#039;t think any of her skins are satisfactory for purchase as there isn&#039;t even a skin which costs over 750RP. Please put this into your thoughts and think of an Evelynn skin concept, i&#039;m sure many would be fascinated.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-06-21T10:15:14.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"safecracker reasonable recent (last year!?) so older champs going to get one 1st","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-06-21T08:33:02.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She needs a visual update first.\n\nWe were promised that she'd get a Visual Update before getting a new skin, then we got Safe Cracker so that promise was destroyed.\n\nShe desperately NEEDS a VU first.\n\nOh and Masquerade is best skin.","replies":[]}]}
