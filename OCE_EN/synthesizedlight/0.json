Then after the game ended, the stats didn&#039;t load and now even if I click the Play button it doesn&#039;t actually do anything but show a never-ending loading circle after about 30 or so seconds. Is anybody else having issues like this? I&#039;d like to know if it&#039;s just a problem on my end or not. My ISP is TPG.","replies":[]}
