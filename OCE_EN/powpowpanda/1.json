Players will need to be diamond 4 or above and be able to play ~6-10pm (AEST) each night as well as be available on the weekend for the OOL tournament.\r\n\r\nAll roles are welcome to trial, and in the applicable cases will be trialing against the current roster members of the team.\r\nPlease add me in game (ign): Powpowpanda","replies":[]}
