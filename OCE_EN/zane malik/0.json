I have here with me today a story involving the n-word. The story is short and pretty boring but what I'm hoping to get from this is a bit of coverage on the matter and a bit of a vote on whether or not Riot are racist. Be careful though as the n-word is a very sensitive word, keep the trolling to a minimum if you can. This thread is also similar to Django in the fact that the n-word will be used a lot (no hate speech here Riot so please relax).\n\nSo today I was playing a few games on my level 22 account when someone on the enemy team called one of their teammates, the n-word. Now before we go any further... yes, I do know what the word means and where it originated from. It definitely can be, under certain circumstances, a bad word however it is also used in the form of slang in a way that has no offence attached to it. What I mean by using it in the form of slang is like this;\n\n*This is a quote from some of my friends during my time working in America on a summer camp*\nPerson A: Whatsup n-word how you been?\nPerson B: Good good and you?\nPerson A: Not too bad man... *ending it here*\n\nNow my friends (I'm not using their names here) are not using the the n-word in a hate speech type of way. The fact that people call each other the n-word when they are greeting one and other or something just calling their friend/best friend/family member the n-word should be obvious enough that they're not using it as hate speech. YES it can definitely and most commonly is used (publicly) as hate speech but that does not make it a word you can never use. African Americans use it all the time when the talk to each other and might I direct you to listen to a bunch of famous African American artists such as Jay-Z, Kanye West, Tupac, Biggie, etc and make notice of when they call a friend of theirs the n-word.\n\nNow back on track here. Today, I defended the the n-word and said in all chat (ooo scary I know I used all chat xd) that the word isn't just a hate speech word. It can be used in a friendly manner as slang, from friend to friend as an example. Now just to point in in case people are wondering;\n\n- No I did not call anyone the n-word.\n- Nor did I use the the n-word in a bad way.\n- Nor did I say anything racist.\n\nTo be specific I simply said it's not a bad word unless you structure it to be one. The user of the word should decide the intended meaning; slang or hate speech.\n\nNow keep in mind here, I've heard this word used in person quite a bit over a 4 month period while being in America and not once... not a single time was it used in a bad way. These were my African American friends (and some of my white American friends who think they're ghetto af) calling each other the n-word. \n\nI do understand the history of the word and how genuinely f****d up that time was and I despise it immensely but this is 2017 and we need to accept that the word is used a lot and guess what? It's not just used in a bad way!\n\nJust like when your friend tells you something lame and your reply is something along the lines of \"that's gay\". You're not saying that thing was homosexual you're meaning 'gay' as in dumb or lame. You're using it as slang. YES using it like that (IMO) is wrong and it's a difficult thing to stop if you're used to hearing it. However, that doesn't mean that you're saying homosexual's are dumb or lame it's simply that the word \"gay\" has taken on a form of slang.\n\nIn no way am I racist nor am I homophobic. I have African American friends... I have 'gay' friends... My grandmother is a lesbian... my colleagues are gay... some of my friends are bisexual... I have friends and family from all over the globe from many nationalities... I love them all (nohomo) and that doesn't waver because of their sexuality or because of their skin color.\n\n \nSo... to the point... why am I being instantly 14-day suspended (no chat-restrictions or prior punishments on this account + Honor 3) for defending the n-word? I believe the word can be used without any negativity (specifically without referring to someone as a black slave) or without being hate speech. \n\nI also believe that if you think that the word can only be used in one way then;\n\n1. You're racist.\n2. Ignorant.\n3. Arrogant.\n4. Stuck in an era that ended a very long time ago. \n\nI also dare you to go and say that to any African American that uses it as a greeting or as slang without any negativity in it. Tweet about it and tag Kanye in it. \n\nRemove my ban and return my honor thank you very much.\n\n*EDIT*\nRiot have finally responded! My 14-day suspension is apparently justified because Riot have 0 tolerance to hate speech! Totally understandable as I have 0 tolerance towards hate speech but if I followed Riots logic they have used to justify my punishment I would in fact say anyone who listens to rap music or uses words in the hate speech category without using hate speech are in fact now hate speech-ers XD \n\nJust in case anyone is confused:\nHate speech: noun\nspeech that attacks, threatens, or insults a person or group on the basis of national origin, ethnicity, color, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, or disability.\n\nSo I wont post my entire chat log here or the entire email conversation here but I will post the exact reference of the use of the n-word from my logs and I will summarise the replies I’ve received from Riot employees so far;\n\n_Zane Malik: Is there something wrong with the word %%%%%%?\nZane Malik: If a black person calls a black person a %%%%%% are they racist?\nZane Malik: Nope\nZane Malik: Depends how you use it\nZane Malik: Doesn't matter\nZane Malik: If a black person calls a white person a %%%%%%\nZane Malik: It;s not racist\nZane Malik: He means it as in a friend_\n\nSummary from my emails with Riot employees;\n\nThe n-word in any form or context is ONLY a slur and therefore is IMMEDIATELY considered hate speech which is punishable by an instant suspension or permanant ban.\n\nThe word gay in any form or context is ONLY a slur and therefore is IMMEDIATELY considered hate speech which is punishable by an instant suspension or permanant ban.\n\nBasically I’ve deduced that even though the word gay in order of it’s meaning as the years went by go from; expressing happiness to a form of sexuality to a slur; Riot don’t acknowledge this at all. Context and alternate meaning do not exist in League of Legends; if it can be used as a slur in another context it is hereby determined to be a slur! \n\nCareful with what you say guys because remember context doesn’t matter nor does anything you intend/mean/think it’s only what Riot think and we all give them this power when we agree to the T&amp;Cs :) \n\nLink your PSNs below if you want to play some FORTNITE with me :)","replies":[{"poster":"Mother500ml","date":"2017-11-18T08:56:03.577+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"They throwing out 14 day bans as if Christmas came early :')","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2017-11-18T09:15:01.270+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{sticker:sg-ahri-1}} \n\nWhat the heck, Riot!!!\n\nWe all know you don't care about your playerbase, but this is *way* too much.\n\nGet a grip of yourself!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-11-18T09:10:15.167+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"There's banning because of a person being an idiot without a brain saying stuff, and banning because of this. \n\nThere's a line and Riot definitely crossed it. \n\nIf Riot were even slightly decent, they would revoke the ban and give you back Honour 3.

They don't care about the players, so the best thing to do would be to */mute all* and hope you don't get a single minor infraction that will perma ban you.","replies":[{"poster":"Zane Malik","date":"2017-11-18T09:43:03.316+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would have no qualms with being instantly suspended if I was being negative or racist and displaying hate speech! Though I did nothing of the sort so I'm definitely left wondering what's going on with the tribunal system!\n\nI'm not 100% sure if that's totally correct! What I mean by that is I definitely think there are Riot employees that would love the ability to take things case by case and have the power to revoke certain punishments but I don't think the company structures it that way so the employees really don't have a lot of choice sometimes. However, the need to revoke my ban shouldn't exist in this case because realistically I shouldn't have been banned lol :p \n\nI am very nervous now that if I say anything at all to anyone about anything I will get punished; same goes for being silent so I think i'm screwed here :3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-11-18T13:46:04.578+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"While I personally agree with you here.. \n\nOffence isn't given, it is taken.\n\nSo while you may not intend the word to be seen in a negative way, you can't know how someone else may react to it.\nTo us the intention is very clear because of the context you use the word in, but you have to remember that people love being a martyr.\nThere is nothing people like more than the attention that comes from yelling out _\"Im a victim!\"_, and they'll take any scrap of a chance they can get to do so.\nSo its better to just not give them the chance, and find another word to use instead.\n\nThere is a 0-tolerance policy in league, and if even one person is genuinely offended by its use then that is one more person feeling bad than there needed to be.\n\nPerosnally, I think the whole 'victim' mentality has gone a bit mad tbh, almost to the point where it's nearly as oppressive as actual racism or homophobia.\nLike this:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYsUKPoW-Qo\n\nThis ad genuinely makes me embarrassed to be a Kiwi.  \nThe meaning behind these sorts of things:\n_\"You cant say 'gay', thats **OUR** word!\"_\n_\"You cant say 'N____', thats **OUR** word!\"_\nis in itself racial or sexual discrimination, which is a step completely in the wrong direction. and the people who preach it are so caught up in being 'victims' that they cant see the forrest for the trees.\n\nThe whole point of equality is that everyone is the same and has equal right to do things. All of that falls apart when you start imposing rules that apply to only some demographics: _\"It's ONLY not-racist when black people use the N word.\"_, _\"The word 'gay' can ONLY be used when talking specifically about homosexual people.\"_ etc.\n\nIf I put an ad out saying: _\"I want you to change the linguistics regarding the way we refer to a 'straight' line, because it offends me when people use that word other than when referring to my sexuality!\"_ Id probably be slapped with some kind of hate-speech law suit, or probably be stabbed in the street by some SJW. How is that equality?\n\nHowever these are all problems for the real world, league is an environment where people come to enjoy themselves, and if it has the risk of making someone uncomfortable then perhaps it's best to just leave it out of the conversation. As the main aim of the game is to just have a good time _(for everyone)_.","replies":[{"poster":"kLfBtMarshall","date":"2017-11-19T10:08:34.206+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"im offended by everything you have just said","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zane Malik","date":"2017-11-19T01:32:27.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I totally agree on pretty much everything you’ve said there!\n\nOne thing to point out however is I never called anyone the n-word (neither n***er or n***a) so to be banned for hate speech (which I assume I was because the word n***er is hate speech and also the enemy who claimed they reported me said they reported me for hate speech) is Ludicrous (anyone get my joke there). \n\nMy aim for this post is to expose Riot’s flaws and hope they not just fix it but admit to it and also obviously revoke this because it’s outrageous; but also it’s to get some traction and more awareness on the fact that there is an acceptable and commonly used form of a word that isn’t hate speech. Before *gay* was used for homosexuals it was a word to describe ones happiness and still does mean that when used with the correct context.\n\nImagine if you (in chat) quoted a biggie small or Tupac lyric in game while listening to one of their songs while in a 5 man party with friends... then they decide to say i’m feeling super gay today (really really HAPPY) and then one of the enemy summoners reports them for hate speech and because the words *n-word* and *gay* were used they were instantly banned.

I cannon answer what the player in question meant, however we consider the word go o k a racist term and we punish it as such.\n\nto which I said\n\n> please recognise that I was requesting clarification of whether the other player said go o k intentionally. This was a genuine request because I find that term abhorrent given that my son is half chinese and my in laws are chinese. It appears that you believe I was using this term as an insult but if you check the full chat log it was in response to another person saying it and I was seeking clarification as to whether I was going to report for racism because I find this term disgusting. \n\nto which they said\n\n> Indeed, you did not say go o k with the purpose of offending someone. However, the rest of the chat is bad as well.\n\nFor full disclosure, I said \"neck yourself\" in one game (in fuck knows how many years of play) and was dishing it back to a toxic shit lord with some pretty colourful language after enduring 3 consecutive games of toxic shitlords.\n\nSo I got a 14 day suspension triggered by a racist term, the player behaviour guy said \"oh yeah fair enough the context was important and you weren't actually being racist at all, but you were a bit sweary so the 14 day suspension still holds\".\n\nThis is piss poor in my humble opinion. This was ~2 weeks before end of season. Ended my season, lost the rewards. And it seems like a LOT of people are having the same frustration with overzealous bans / suspensions. And player behaviour guys are being total dicks about it, saying (and I quote):\n\n> Whether you wish to keep playing League or not is your choice and we respect it.\n\nThey could have saved a lot of words if they had simply said \"go fuck yourself\".\n\nReally pissed off with the application of these bans, and really pissed off with the people employed to administer them.

Played a few games on alt but uninstalled a few days after. Might come back one day but not for the time being and certainly not on my main until they sort out this bullshit with 14 day suspensions being handed out willy nilly with no escalation through the punishment tiers and utter contempt from player behaviour. All it will take is one dubious duo Q to both report and then the account is toast. Not gonna risk it. But to be honest I think thats it - if I do come back it will be mid season, I'll get screwed over by all the changes, someone will flame because I'm struggling with new wards / items / builds, I'll tell them to fuck off, then I'll get another ban.\n\nBeen playing a lot of fallout 4 and heroes of the storm (a few of my mates play that because they are blizzard fanboys and cant stand league at all) and I've been getting to bed early so its not all bad ha ha.
