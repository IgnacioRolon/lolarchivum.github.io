Screams echoed through the streets before getting sliced in two by the blades of Noxus. Darius and Draven chopping and hacking through bodies and pushing towards the main palace containing the target, containing the intel of all the Demacian attacks. As the Noxian forces pushed towards the palace reinforcements arrived. Garen and Lux attacked from behind, destroying the forces from at the back of the noxian army and rallying the citizens to fight back. As Draven breached the palace, Darius defended his back forcing the Demacians away from them. As both sides lost men Garen and Darius clashed blades but never striked the other. Draven rushed out of the palace holding pages full of intel. As Draven ran he did not see Lux fire a blast of blinding light, disorientating him and making him drop the package. Lux sprinted over and grabbed it with Garen slowly backing up towards Lux, bringing Darius towards them. Slowly Draven got back up and flung an axe towards Lux and Garen, slicing Garen's arm and forcing him to drop his weapon. This gave Darius the chance to strike him, slamming his axe through him, caving him in half. Lux just stood and stared a Garens halves fell to the ground. In the seconds that passed Darius and Draven chopped Lux to pieces. With the fight over Darius and Draven started the long walk back to Noxus. &ldquo;Hey Draven,&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; &ldquo;Momma said you were adopted.&rdquo;\n\n{{champion:122}}  {{champion:119}}  {{champion:86}}  {{champion:99}}","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T12:12:05.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Brutal XD absolutely brutal.","replies":[{"poster":"Oly","date":"2016-08-11T21:12:40.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thx man","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aachoo","date":"2016-06-28T01:33:41.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that is really cool","replies":[]}]}
