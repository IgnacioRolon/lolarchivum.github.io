Account sharing is in direct violation of the TOU and EULA. \"Someone else was playing\" is no excuse when the account is personal to you and you've agreed to that fact.\n\nThat said, it doesn't really matter who was using the account, and from the looks of things you're the more toxic of the two.

Both games were punishment worthy, and sharing your account is against the ToS and technically grounds for a ban all on it's own (though Riot typically don't except for things like boosting). All action taken on your account is your own responsibility, and since you let them play on your account, you are accountable for their actions while on it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-02-08T03:47:46.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Account sharing is bad, using offensive language is bad, arguing with other players is bad.\nAvoid these three things and you'll be fine, but you already knew that.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
