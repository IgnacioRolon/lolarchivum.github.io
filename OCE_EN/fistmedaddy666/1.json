{"poster":"FistMeDaddy666","date":"2017-04-09T11:44:41.007+0000","title":"My Account has been Permanently Banned","subforum":"Player Behaviour","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, I admit that I&#039;m a repeat offender of the Instant Feedback System, I&#039;ve got about 3 accounts permabanned from not learning my lesson. Now, I log on today for a couple league matches, I meet a guy in a game, who was convinced that I was somehow horrible, and kept on bullying me, so I stood up to the bully, and started roasting the * out of him (but I was toxic), see, I learned my lesson the time when I got my 2 week ban, and this is one of the incidents that got me permabanned, the other one was when me and an enemy Vladimir were having a quick banter sesh, it involved little to no toxicity, and we were just having fun. I think that players got the wrong idea when I was talking to the Vladimir in that game, and I don&#039;t think it&#039;s just to punish me for having fun in League of Legends, which is a game.\n\nAlthough Riot have not e-mailed me about which games that I was toxic in, I&#039;m pretty sure it was the two I mentioned earlier.\n\nIn the first game where I was permanently banned for being too toxic, I was playing as Malzahar in an ARSR (All Random Summoner&#039;s Rift) game, a teammate Mundo was harassing me, kept saying that I was horrible at the game, this trash that trash, so I tried to tell him to stop. Whenever he said something I told him to calm down, because I thought that it would help calm the situation, but when he started blaming a fellow teammate Cho&#039; Gath, was when I got really angry. He started blaming Cho&#039; Gath for our &quot;loss&quot; (even though we had not lost yet) and was harassing him as well. I stood up to him and started swearing a lot at him because I lost my *. At the end of the game, the person who I was defending, the Cho&#039; Gath, reported both myself and the Mundo on our team, I&#039;m not sure why he reported me because I didn&#039;t say or do anything toxic to him, and was actually trying to help him.\n\nIn the second game, the last game I played before this discussion, I was playing as Nidalee in another ARSR game, where I was pretty much dominating, except for the enemy Vlad who would kill me every time he saw the chance to. Vladimir and I had started engaging in some friendly banter, and were exchanging comebacks (friendly). He would call me an &quot;ugly rat&quot; and I&#039;d call him a &quot;stinky tampon&quot;, I didn&#039;t mean any of these insults to be nasty. It even got to the point where I would use &quot;heck&quot; or &quot;frick&quot; against him. I believe that someone had a misunderstanding, and didn&#039;t understand that the banter was on friendly terms, and we weren&#039;t trying to offend each other. I recall a teammate Amumu regarding the League of Legends community as &quot;accepting&quot; and that he always felt included when he got on.\n\nI will post what I said in both these games when Riot e-mails me about the Permaban, giving me more information to work with. I&#039;ve been with League since I was 10 years old, and, although being toxic on more than one occasion, tried to help the LoL community in any way possible.\n\nEdit: Never got the e-mail, logged on to see what I got banned for, turns out I only got banned for toxicity in one game, not two.\n\nHere's the log:\n\nGame 1\nFistMeDaddy666: help @ blu fam\nFistMeDaddy666: ww\nFistMeDaddy666: help blu\nFistMeDaddy666: thx bois <3\nFistMeDaddy666: ayy fam\nFistMeDaddy666: thx fam\nFistMeDaddy666: hows that for shit jinx\nFistMeDaddy666: fucking end me\nFistMeDaddy666: im trash\nFistMeDaddy666: KILL ME\nFistMeDaddy666: hey jinx lets play guess the %%%%%%\nFistMeDaddy666: whos the %%%%%% jinx?\nFistMeDaddy666: WHOS THE %%%%%%\nFistMeDaddy666: DID YOU GUESS VLAD?!\nFistMeDaddy666: WELL YOU WERE RIGHT!\nFistMeDaddy666: wow\nFistMeDaddy666: it was nibbe\nFistMeDaddy666: nibber\nFistMeDaddy666: soz cant do shit against them\nFistMeDaddy666: WAHT THEF UK\nFistMeDaddy666: I COULDNT HIT THE PIECE OF SHIT BOUNCY PLANT\nFistMeDaddy666: fuck i had flash and everything\nFistMeDaddy666: i wouldve gotten out ez\nFistMeDaddy666: WAHT\nFistMeDaddy666: HA YES\nFistMeDaddy666: i hate ms rn\nFistMeDaddy666: sO CLOSEEeE!1\nFistMeDaddy666: AYYYYYYY\nFistMeDaddy666: feck\nFistMeDaddy666: wb fam\nFistMeDaddy666: dibbs top farm\nFistMeDaddy666: DIBBS\nFistMeDaddy666: ww no :(\\\nFistMeDaddy666: LOL YOU MISSED THE CANNON\nFistMeDaddy666: ayy the mumu\nFistMeDaddy666: lol rip jinx\nFistMeDaddy666: calm down vlad\nFistMeDaddy666: u stinky vampires\nFistMeDaddy666: go be stinky\nFistMeDaddy666: you stink\nFistMeDaddy666: stinky tampons\nFistMeDaddy666: go b8\nFistMeDaddy666: hows this for shit jinx\nFistMeDaddy666: fuck was ab to kill you w q\nFistMeDaddy666: you stinky period head\nFistMeDaddy666: no you sir\nFistMeDaddy666: you are not a good sir\nFistMeDaddy666: you a bad sir\nFistMeDaddy666: stinky sir\nFistMeDaddy666: OH MY GOD FUCK OFF YOU STINKY PERIODHEAD\nFistMeDaddy666: the warwickinator is in the house fam\nFistMeDaddy666: oooh\nFistMeDaddy666: well you is the most stinky\nFistMeDaddy666: lolwat\nFistMeDaddy666: frick you you fricky frick\nFistMeDaddy666: go away to your home\nFistMeDaddy666: fricking\nFistMeDaddy666: we need some birth control\nFistMeDaddy666: go to your home you hecking frick\nFistMeDaddy666: heck you!\nFistMeDaddy666: HECK\nFistMeDaddy666: HECK TO YOU YOU FRICKING FRICKER\nFistMeDaddy666: YOU HAVE BEEN UNBLESSED YOU ARE GOING OT HECK\nFistMeDaddy666: YOU ARE SO NOT LIT HECK YOU\nFistMeDaddy666: u are heckin fat n stinky\nFistMeDaddy666: ok listen to jinx\nFistMeDaddy666: :O\nFistMeDaddy666: HEY!\nFistMeDaddy666: THATS NO GOOD\nFistMeDaddy666: cyberbullyer\nFistMeDaddy666: :O! :O! :O!\nFistMeDaddy666: the fbi are gonna heckin catcha\nFistMeDaddy666: no fuck you mumu\nFistMeDaddy666: bullseye %%%ggot\nFistMeDaddy666: feelsbadman\nFistMeDaddy666: ugh no\nFistMeDaddy666: its my gender\nFistMeDaddy666: you danging heck\nFistMeDaddy666: i damn you to the depths of hell\nFistMeDaddy666: yes fam\nFistMeDaddy666: what the fuck when did zyra do shit\nFistMeDaddy666: you ggez lol roast\nFistMeDaddy666: you are a roast\nFistMeDaddy666: i am hecking ur mother as we speak kind sir\nFistMeDaddy666: i like to participate in fine gourmet dining\nFistMeDaddy666: it makes me heckin horny when you speak like you're trash\nFistMeDaddy666: ok full build done\nFistMeDaddy666: WAIT WHAT THE FUCK\nFistMeDaddy666: I GOT 2 ZHONYAS\nFistMeDaddy666: yah fam\nFistMeDaddy666: stinky tampon\nFistMeDaddy666: you smell like youre a fetus\nFistMeDaddy666: not when they're in vlads mum, trust me she a dirty hoe\nFistMeDaddy666: dirt all over her","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-09T12:23:37.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't know who you cant see why you wouldn't be banned, 80% of that log is considered offensive, friendly or not.","replies":[{"poster":"FistMeDaddy666","date":"2017-04-09T12:29:04.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The one that I \"offended\" friended me after the game, and we were about to play another game together.
