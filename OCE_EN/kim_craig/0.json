I&#039;m a LVL 4 Defender Sona, not far of 5 and her mastery isn&#039;t showing up in game even though I have reached level 4 and almost over half way to 5. Thought I might mention this not sure if it&#039;s a bug or not.\n\nAlso not sure if its cause I've been using DJ Sona. cause it shows up on all her other skins as well. really not sure but it seems to be a big bug. \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-10T11:58:17.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this happened to me I'd be extremely happy.\n\n[Bug Reports belong on the appropriate board.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report)","replies":[]}]}
