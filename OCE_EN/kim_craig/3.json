I would of loved to have seen SG Neekos gold star in place of her green one with the prestige skin, with some different flares ect around it. same goes for Project irelia, and arcade Caitlyns prestige skins. I personally feel as this would make that border more special with the icon rather than an icon and that same prestige border. (See below for an idea) (because IMO the current border looks more like a golden K/DA border than any other prestige skin out there) \n\nOverall i dont work at Riot i dont know how these things are decided, but I feel like they should at least be heard by the community, thanks for the read peoples!\n\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}} \n\n\n\n https://i.imgur.com/m5Ybnds.png  https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5KXIT1a7jYg/XXAHWpYWvGI/AAAAAAABYLA/RTJBixGptgcGM-jvAT64qmfoiKJumCRIgCLcBGAs/s1600/neekoloadscreen_10_le.pie_c_9_18.jpg https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Zgw1_BR_pMA/XXAHBsQ11II/AAAAAAABYKQ/gDv1wLAx0n0uMlicQNSumi-CVlyGeDVngCLcBGAs/s1600/neekoloadscreen_11_le.prestige_neeko_starguardian.jpg (SG Prestige Neeko Idea, creates variety but still links to the other SG skins while keeping part of the prestige border vs her regular and current prestige skin border)","replies":[]}
