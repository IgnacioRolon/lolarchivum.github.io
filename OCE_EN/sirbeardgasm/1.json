Really fun champ. But i have noticed a few gameplay issues since last patch..\r\n1. His WEQ dash combo. When Azir ends the dash, sometimes he will become stuck on the soldier for a second or two, unable to move.\r\n2. Auto-attacking with soldiers when a target is at the edge of their radius causes the attack to not always hit, even though it plays the animation. Attacking via another target is fine though.\r\n3. Shaco's clone is able to COMPLETELY IGNORE Azir's wall. Not sure if this is a bug but considering similar player made terrain (Anivia's wall stopping Shaco clone etc), I assume it is. Also, I had a Fizz able to Playful/Trickster over the wall. Not sure if that is on purpose considering Lee Sin cannot Q through and Rengar cannot leap it. Is it because Fizz is invulnerable during his E?\r\n\r\nOtherwise, he is an extremely fun champ to play once you get the hang of him.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2014-12-12T21:59:49.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an Azir main i have noticed the Auto-Attacking problem a lot and it can sometimes allow them to escape when it would usually get you a kill and is infuriating for farming\n\ni havent noticed the WEQ combo problem yet (admittedly i haven't played much since the patch)\n\nShaco's clone should NOT be able to bypass the wall so this is almost certainly a bug.\n\nbut yes Fizz is allowed to cross the wall because of his untargetability Zed's ultimate is the same\nalso some other abilities like Malphite's ultimate can cross it because is is called \"unstoppable force\" and would go against riots view of clarity in game if it could be stopped. Vi's ultimate is the same as like malphite's it states in the tooltip \"immune to crowd control\" others like Noc and rek'sai are the same \nBlink abilities such as Ezreals E, Shaco's Q, and flash can also cross it \nall other dashes should be stopped\ni am unsure what happens with team-related CC tho for example if blitz tries to pull someone over the wall does the pull work all the way or will they stop at the wall? i haven't tried this yet\n\nAlso other problems i have noticed is that sometimes when you create a turret and it targets someone during its creation but doesn't fire a shot the red targeting line tracks them all over the map until either they or the turret dies (this does not provide vision on the champ) \n\nOn aram his ultimate sometimes flings champions sideways instead of backward\n\nsometimes on summoners rift even though his passive is down you still get the option to click on destroyed turrets and it does the animation of the golden streams coming from his model but no turret is created,\n\nalso if you activate his passive and die during the animation sometimes the turret is made and sometimes not (when it isn't the passive does not go on cd)\n\nalso and this isn't a bug just a weird mechanic that in my opinion should be fixed i have made a post here about it:\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/k1E4PcTo-azir-weird-mechanic-for-chasing-with-multiple-soldiers-riot-plz-read\n\nif you are as keen on azir as me, read it (yes i know its long) as it might help you when chasing \neven though i think it should be changed it does help to know how it currently functions.\n\nhe is in my opinion one of the most fun champs ever made. Good luck and have fun :)","replies":[]}]}
