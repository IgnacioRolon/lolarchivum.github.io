I have no idea.\n\nAnyway, a couple of things before I get started. I know it&#039;s a well known fact that {{champion:266}}  is so far behind the &#039;meta&#039; and that next to no-one plays him. I know in terms of other champions, he falls short in a lot of areas. I also know it&#039;s a bit late to be poking around the buff/tweak back in the really late patches coming up to worlds, that even if my voice is heard, changes won&#039;t come until after worlds *sad face*.\n\nA week ago, Nemesis Draft got me playing Aatrox in the jungle a couple of times, and I absolutely loved playing it, and now I bought him and still do. Okay, get on with it.\n\nPassive: I believe is fine where it is. The passive attack speed buff with a fuller Blood Well is a nice touch.\n\nQ: I feel it needs a bit more range. It&#039;s quite short in my opinion, and trying to land a knock-up in it&#039;s even smaller little circle is quite difficult. The knock-up area could be widened, or perhaps enemies are knocked-up for longer to make it feel more rewarding for sniping it, or even perhaps a larger slow if knock-up is achieved after they land, similar to Cho&#039;Gath&#039;s Q. \nThe cooldown does seem to be fair enough, but maybe a little bit shorter both early and late game would be extremely helpful in terms of skirmishing, ganks and teamfighting. Often it&#039;s used once and that&#039;s it, and more often used as an escape rather then an initiation because of it&#039;s small area to attempt to try and hit a carry with who can easily backstep one step and be out of range due to cast-time.\nI&#039;m unsure about the damage factor. Maybe it could be buffed slightly? Again, unconcerned as it used for utility only. (Which also sucks at it drains a seemingly excessive amount of health for being a hard-to-hit utility ability only.)\n    A tweak I feel is necessary is if Q is used in the fog of war, it should grant vision of his destination. There is a lot of down time trying to click a jungle creep that is floating mid air, so often I&#039;ll find myself just sitting there for half a second while I wait for it to land :c\n\nW: Bread and butter of Aatrox, I believe that the heal portion could use a slight bit of love on the flat base heal when over 50% health (but thus meaning increasing the heal when below 50% health, might have to be tweaked). Otherwise, I feel it&#039;s good where it stands.\n   *Bug: The sound effect for both when the 3rd hit is ready and the on hit doesn&#039;t play sometimes after using Q straight after aa #2 (and attacking straight after respectively). It can get confusing when you&#039;re tracking the passive through sound effect and it does not play due to using Q.\n\nE: Cooldown ratios seem fine as they stand, generally because it&#039;s maxed second. I personally feel the damage could also use some love, but by looking at the numbers, I believe it to be pretty fair as it is.\n\nR: Great as it is. However, I would like to see some sort of Spell Vamp effect on it&#039;s use. Aatrox is literally sucking in the blood of his enemies right? But doesn&#039;t he heal off doing that? For some reason, his ult doesn&#039;t seem to follow through on that &#039;fantasy&#039; . So my suggestion: when used while over 50% health, heals for 10/15/20% of damage dealt. When used while under 50% health, heals for 60/65/70% of damage dealt (multiple champions hit can possibly dampen the effect, because say 5 champions are hit, that&#039;s like a huge heal.\n\nLet&#039;s show {{champion:266}} some lovin&#039; . Poor guy needs to move up from a mere hack job.\n\n~Nxn\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}\n\n*Edit\nIf you have feedback for me, or feedback of your own for this matter, I encourage you to comment your thoughts. I'd like to have a good discussion about this!","replies":[{"poster":"Glow","date":"2016-08-30T06:22:51.218+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like you said, Aatrox hardly ever gets played and I don't play him so I can't really offer much feedback on the adjustments you've proposed. They seem well reasoned though :) Whenever I do come up against an Aatrox I find his healing/regen shenanigans really hard to deal with, maybe just because the only people playing Aatrox are his die-hard fans who are really good at him, lol. \n\nI think this board is the right place for this, but if you're looking for more response/discussion I would post it on the NA boards as they have a more active community on the forums ^_^","replies":[]}]}
