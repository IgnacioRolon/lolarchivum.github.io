I feel like spending RP to buy something it needs to change it enough to encourage people who are more conservative with the way they spend money to buy it, since there is no problem with people who enjoy spending lots of money on little things. \r\n\r\nIP is a resource that you gain as a result of your time playing. A player who has already spent their money on the skin should be able to spend the resource of their time to change the skin to be more to their liking as oppose to feeling like they need to spend more real money to give the skin that little colour change they wanted when they bought it.","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-04-16T08:59:45.714+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"they'd be better off making it a reward for champion mastery. that way people would have something significant to show off their skill with a champ.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-16T09:06:53.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"given all the backlash and reddit going hard with making chroma's that people can download for themselves, that this will probably be what happens.","replies":[{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-04-16T09:18:04.879+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i hope that is the case, spending RP for some different coloured champion... no thanks, pass.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-16T09:27:41.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well fact is if you want it, just change your files to do it, it's maybe 5 minutes of work to do what Rito will do, sure it only shows for you, but does it matter?","replies":[{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-04-16T09:31:19.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, but if its that easy to do that then why would they make it cost money? wouldn't you just make it a achievement so then people play more..","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-04-16T09:47:40.088+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot Games\n\n\nThat is all.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-04-16T09:44:31.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even after the community outcry and people calling Riot out on their bullshit like them calling these skins \"high standards\" when it takes like 30 minutes to make a chroma, they'll still probably give a big fuck you to the community and charge us this dumb price instead of letting us earn them.\n\nAfter Riot did this i lost a lot of respect for them, its getting to the point where ill have no respect for them anymore if they keep pulling this shit.","replies":[{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-04-16T11:40:45.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is 100% right, the thing that got me was back in the days when i mained riven, i loved the redeemed riven skin, they changed that to look like absolute garbage and i complained and they in simple words told me to fuck off and to not bother then, gg riot to greedy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"greatdeathz","date":"2015-04-16T10:47:26.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"u ever play on garena lol they still sell legacy skins in their shop-.-","replies":[]}]}]}
