As usual there's the fear that trolls with just buy these items from the start and do touchdowns with their new pretty hat or whatever.\r\n\r\nWho knows, maybe Riot could stem an actual idea from this.","replies":[{"poster":"Lonely Flame","date":"2015-02-24T04:52:44.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or they could just unlock after X amount of time has passed and X amount of gold has been gained/spent. Eg the game has been going for 50 min, the player has earned 15000+ gold (which is about Sorcerer's Shoes, Liandry's, Rabadon's, Rod of Ages, Void Staff, Zhonya's), and spent 15000+ gold.\n\nWhile cosmetic effects are good, typically if the game has lasted this long players are looking to END the game, which is what the Elixir's are meant to fulfill. I think more gameplay changing items would be a bit better. Maybe the ability to buy one extra item slot? Add an extra upgrade onto some other items in a similar effect to boot enchantments (for example, the ability to buy an enchantment on an item that would reduce the cooldown on the active).","replies":[{"poster":"Cirilia","date":"2015-02-25T06:38:16.331+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the time/money thought, it makes sense. Where I also agree that players do want to end the game at that point, the idea of giving someone something to do with money at the end of the game is all that's behind it. The ability to by an extra item however sort of eliminates the theory behind a limit to how ahead a player can get. If a player gets fed early game often the only thing a team can do is to wait out the late game so everyone can catch up to the fed player.\n\nI do like the enchantments dealeo though, you should totally post a discussion about it\n\nCheers for the feedback","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-02-24T03:09:20.025+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> As usual there's the fear that trolls with just buy these items from the start and do touchdowns with their new pretty hat or whatever.\n\nYou could have it so you can only buy the cosmetic items once you have filled all your item slots. Prevents people just getting them straight up.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-24T03:36:51.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And then they buy six longswords? :P","replies":[{"poster":"Riso","date":"2015-02-24T06:35:35.381+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"6 fairy charms on Yas anyone?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-02-24T03:39:23.579+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So make it so the items have to be fully upgraded.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-02-24T02:56:51.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well im sure it will bring in players from steam.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-23T06:58:45.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can spend 400 gold EVERY SINGLE BACK.","replies":[]}]}
