Although when playing someone such as Janna {{champion:40}} , Lux {{champion:99}}  and Orianna {{champion:61}}  , you get no recognition for all of the damage you mitigated with your shields. The same though could be said about Alistar {{champion:12}}  and Garen {{champion:86}}  with their &#039;Reduce Damage&#039; effects which mitigates damage to an extent. Recording this is just a way to show your contribution to the team in another way to help get a little more recognition.","replies":[]}
