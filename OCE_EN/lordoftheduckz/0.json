Ionia was said to be the most beautiful civilization, Shen could see why and wondered how bad the other lands were. All of a sudden a loud horn blew in the distance; Shen knew at once it was he horn of Ionia only used in the darkest of times. Shen could not sit in the mountains wile Ionia was in danger so he suddenly left off the roof onto the soft grass below, as silent as a mouse he began the descent into the valley below. \r\nShen had walked all night before he had reached the southern city of Tuula where he would find a garrison of Ionian soldiers led by Irelia daughter of the famous Master Lito. Her brother Zelos was nowhere to be seen but Shen could listen from the shadows on the war council Shen leaned of the war hearing of Zelos&rsquo;s journey to seek help from Demacia, and the general of Noxian forces, A large brute called Darius.\r\nThe shrill horn cried in the distance as the Noxian force approached, there could be no fighting the Ionian forces were outnumbered one hundred to one. Irelia gave the call &ldquo;Fall back to the Placidium&rdquo;. The Ionian forces began to retreat but she didn&rsquo;t. sitting in the shadows he watched the Noxian force move in and identified his target. A man stood a foot taller than the other warriors bearing a large broad-axe and thick plate armour he would be a formidable foe.\r\nThe Noxian camp rang with laughter and talk as the men shared bread and mead over their fires, within the command tent Darius sat talking to two men, Shen knew at once who they were, the three men had taken over Noxus only ten years ago. The three men of the Noxian high command. Darius the strength, Draven the Symbol and Jericho Swain the Mind. Swain stood up and declared about his intention of returning to Noxus, he told Darius that Ionia was weak and when Ionia fell he would be named Lord of Ionia. \r\nThe next day the Noxian forces moved closer to the Placidium, Shen following closely. Shen had trained for this all his life; he could save Ionia even if it meant giving himself up. He creeped into the Generals tent.\r\nThe Demacian forces hit from one side the Ionians from the other the Noxian forces looked to their commander for orders but nothing happened, they were crushed between the two armies. The Noxian forces surrendered and Shen left in the shadows. Making it to the dojo before dawn. When he awoke his friend Zed approached him &ldquo;Where were you Yesterday?&rdquo;, Shen replied &ldquo;Meditating&rdquo;, when Zed asked him if he had heard of the Noxian invasion and Demacia saving them, &lsquo;Yes, I did&rdquo; Shen answered.\r\nSwain stood over the corpse of his friend Darius, &ldquo;Why did I leave him?&rdquo; he asked himself. &ldquo;I may have a solution&rdquo; said a voice from a distance. Swain turned to find Professor Stanwick. Swain smiled with glee.\r\nNews flung through Valoran Darius had survived the invasion attempt. Only Shen knows the truth.","replies":[{"poster":"MondayWaffles","date":"2016-06-25T03:50:05.642+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love stories with Shen and Zed, and I love this story too {{item:3070}} {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
