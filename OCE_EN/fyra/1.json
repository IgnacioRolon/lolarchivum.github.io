No, because even though I&#039;ve been losing 4v5&#039;s the busted system doesn&#039;t take that into account and will give me a bad rank due to this unfair constant that has occured, riot I wish you would implement into the system something to make it less unfair for people who have consective DC&#039;s instead of basically looking at it like &quot;well it happens, shit happens&quot; because this isn&#039;t fair on my rank or anyone else who has had a constant of DC&quot;s every single provisional game.","replies":[{"poster":"Fyra","date":"2016-12-08T04:19:00.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"UPDATE: It's happened 6 times now.
