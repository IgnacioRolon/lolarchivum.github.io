Furthermore ranked queues were then disabled while they investigate a problem, meanwhile those who started games during the preseason times have now got a provisional game already. Is Riot going to do anything to reset that once the queues come up or are those who have a loss, not expecting it to be part of provisionals just have to suffer that?","replies":[{"poster":"yeah boii","date":"2016-12-06T08:56:11.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say its a bug probz why they have now disabled ranked que","replies":[{"poster":"Fyra","date":"2016-12-06T09:20:48.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh, I truly hope it is, that is so unfair otherwise to just have no warning that it's the new season start.","replies":[]}]}]}
