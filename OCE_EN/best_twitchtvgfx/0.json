I logged in to a reward from riot but the new client showed me the alert through the little bell icon. I clicked and looked at it, upon saying &#039;ok cool thanks&#039; pretty much by closing the window i expected another popup to tell me what the reward was but nothing happened. I have no idea what it was.\r\n\r\nUnless riot is giving out rewards for people who successfully report people they reprimand it must have been a global reward. Anyone?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-01-28T00:30:29.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\n>Gifting notifications have been enabled in the updated client.
