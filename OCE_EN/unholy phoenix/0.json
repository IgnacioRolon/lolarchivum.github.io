So as I do every time ((this happens every patch)) I found this, and haven&#039;t actually seen it before.\r\n\r\nThe part I found especially interesting, was the guy who actually went and searched into Riot&#039;s servers, and all their IPs and everything.\r\nFrom what he thinks, this &quot;33% error&quot; is a problem on Riots end.\r\nFurther through the comments the poster actually sends his patch-log, and a Riot employee states he has been disconnecting after about 30 seconds, where as the poster says he has left it patching for hours.\r\n\r\nI just found it interesting to read, and wondered. Should this be looked into by Riot, that maybe the issue is a disconnection or something on their end.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-28T00:54:12.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's definitely a problem on their end. I got told the same thing about it, and I'm able to play League just fine after I manually download the patch.\n\nI'm more suspecting it's something to do with the program and the way it handles files you already have, not just the connection. I mean, why would it **always** be at 33%?","replies":[]}]}
