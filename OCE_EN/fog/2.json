Why I think a Project skin for Zac? He's a special weapon isn't he? \r\nNote 2. I heard one of the reasons why there isn't a new Zac skin is because of the lack of ideas for a decent skin that isn't simply a recolour. So here's a hint Riot. \r\n\r\nThe Base: \r\n\r\n**Project: Zac**\r\n\r\nI was thinking of having Zac's goo fused to a suit of armour (like how Xerath has his armour statically connected to his body. Not a full suit of armour but parts of armour fixed to his body. So that in-between the armour you would get the glow of Orange that goes with the Project skin lines. I imagine the glow lines would be similar to the glow lines of those shown in Tron Legacy. We could even have the glow pulsating. \r\n\r\n**Abilities**\r\n\r\n* Passive: \r\n\r\nInstead of having just plain old blobs. Have the central part of his body (his head and torso) in the centre. (This is untargetable and purely there for aesthetics). His arms and legs would act as the four blobs merging back together. This could be done in two different animation styles. \r\n\r\n1. The arms and legs could crawl back to each other. \r\n2. The arms and legs (armour) would stay where they are and the blob from his body would stretch out to attach back to the main body and then the legs and arms would follow. \r\n\r\n* Q: \r\n\r\nSince the aim of this skin is to avoid having a simple colour rework. Why not change the animation styles with the abilities? \r\nZac's Q, [instead of punching the enemy could shape his arms into sharp spears and pierce the enemy. ](http://gamingring.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Final-Cut-2-4th-Job.jpg)\r\n\r\n* W:\r\n\r\nSend out a shockwave around his body that would resemble something like Project: [Yasuo's wind wall but a full 360 version. Or maybe a larger scale, more spherical version of Yasuo's Q knock up.](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140901201546/leagueoflegends/images/thumb/d/d7/Yasuo_PROJECT-Screenshot.jpg/613px-Yasuo_PROJECT-Screenshot.jpg)\r\n\r\n* E: \r\n\r\nZac's body would turn itself into a projectile and rocket towards the target location exploding on hit. \r\n\r\n* R:\r\n\r\nZac's R could have his body rotating like those ball things from [Battleships ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZNpk6owt00)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition I think there would be some cool things that could be done to the taunts/jokes etc.\r\n\r\nMaybe Zac's taunt could be him turning himself into a giant laser cannon and saying. I could always use this but I won't or something like that.\r\n\r\nI would draw it myself but I have shit drawing skills when it comes to this kind of thing. So if anyone would like to have a go feel free to do it. \r\n\r\nI don't know if you guys would like this or not but I think it'd be pretty cool.","replies":[{"poster":"TheWhitestLama","date":"2015-03-26T04:17:54.809+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"just make a zac skin riot","replies":[{"poster":"Nìgerian Prince","date":"2015-05-26T08:37:06.089+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-03-19T14:28:08.036+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice idea.

Something like the water-based Zac that is drawn in one of the Pool Party wallpapers would not be a problem for me. Some variations of his base model would be more than welcome as well.","replies":[{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-03-27T04:22:00.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i understand that but you said people saying just a recolouring, i gave a example on recolouring, kennel even have the same splash art for the three of them and i haven't seen much complaint about it.. but if its a newer skin they need to make it more fancy. so your correct :D","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PsychoBananah101","date":"2016-07-29T05:22:36.430+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"PROJECT ZAC PLEASE IVE NEVER WANTED ANYTHING ELSE","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-03-26T04:09:43.676+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Secret agent zac ftw","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-03-25T22:56:42.019+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"PROJECT RENGAR","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2015-09-13T22:55:51.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"As a rengar main YES","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2015-03-19T10:05:55.819+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like i said on the other post… We need it and i would just insta buy it i love these type of skins and Zac is one of my fav champs so yeh perfect match.. \n\nAnd the q would be something like from prototype but on both hands.

A few ideas of these could be;\n - Lava Zac (Utilizing molten rock as part of his armor, with lava as his body)\n - Electronic Zac ( Electricity as his body, you get the gist)\n - Zac can be a figure of each of the four elements, just like Xerath can\n - Corporate Zac? (he could be like coffee and chill in a mug when recalling or something?) (of course not only a recolour should occur here, maybe even some feature additions)\n - Surgeon Zac (blood-type colour, suggest other stuff?)\n \nCan't think of anymore, if i were an artist i would share some artwork, but alas my artistic skills are garbage. These are some ideas.\n \nPeople I saw complain about Kennen not having a skin; why not subatomic particle Kennen (or Scientist Kennen)?\n(just an idea) - His ult looks like a 2-d version of an atom, his base skin a scientist, etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellhound666","date":"2015-03-19T08:46:43.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what about his passive where he drops goo on the ground? what it looks like?","replies":[{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-03-19T09:33:06.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't able to find an example because I only don't know where the fk to find an example of what I'm describing.
