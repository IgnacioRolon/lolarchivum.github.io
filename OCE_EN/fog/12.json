I could use abilities but I couldn't level them up if I had the points for it. Abilities that made my champion move worked and I would move to where the ability would put me but I would be unable to move after that. This went away after about 5 minutes but has anyone else experienced this or was it just me?","replies":[{"poster":"Katsumi","date":"2015-03-22T06:03:39.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did your right click also have a red click or green?

Is your internet connection usually stable? Maybe the game, for that particular game, failed to download move commands and thus, you weren't able to issue move commands to your champion until it refreshed.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
