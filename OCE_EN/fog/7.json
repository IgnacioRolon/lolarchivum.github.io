It'll lock me up for the remainder of the game and almost always result in a loss. Not only does this game-breaker rear its ugly head often, I've also noticed that those modifyer keys (shift, alt, control) aren't behaving as they used to. They no longer work at all on my mouse buttons when I hold them down - it's like the game doesn't realized that I've pressed them. Yet when I use the keyboard it's fine. Something has changed regarding those shift/alt/control keys, I'm sure of it. I'm glad I happened across this post and found out that it's not only me having issues.","replies":[]}]}]}
