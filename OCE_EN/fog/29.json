Player 1 is the Trainer and Player 2 is the Pokemon.\n* This game mode is aimed at being in the mid lane. But can be moved to different arenas according to the players preferences.\n* The Trainer(s) is to stand at the back line away from the line of fire. Whilst the Pokemon(s) are to fight each other but at the Trainer's command. Thus this game mode requires a method of voice communication for the most efficient command giving procedures. \n* This is a turn based game. Each Trainer is allowed to make one command per turn. Once the command is given the other trainer is allowed to give a command immediately with no delay. \n* Dodging. Welcome to Pokemon where we can finally dodge. The Trainer is allowed to call dodge as their turns command but will forfeit their offensive command meaning the enemy can give a second offensive command. \n* Autoattacking. You are allowed one Auto attack with any abilities that buff them. This counts as one offensive command. e.g. Vayne Q/Draven Q.\n* CC. If you successfully cc an opposing Pokemon they forfeit their turn and you are allowed to give a second command. \n* Consumables. Like in regular Pokemon games you are allowed to use consumables but this counts as your turns command.\n\nWinner: The winner is last Pokemon standing. \n\nHave fun. \nAbsolutely have no fking idea why I decided to write this up but I did this randomly in a normal with a friend who I banned from doing any actions without me giving a command. I've also had 3 coffees from Starbucks in the last 2 hours and I'm fired up. I've also seen the Super Bowl commercial with Kim Kardashian and I'm fired up. I've also seen a PAX TF in the last week and I'm fired up. I've also killed a Teemo in the last week and I'm fired up. I've also got a date tonight and I'm fired up! {{summoner:14}} Up","replies":[{"poster":"SumCoolAid","date":"2015-01-30T02:03:38.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did I just hear you say, SumCoolAid, You're a developer and why the hell isn't this already a real PC fan game?.\n\nThe answer is because I failed everyone...\n\nPokeLoL Online Incoming","replies":[]}]}
