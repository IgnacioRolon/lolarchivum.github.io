It will result in a supernova and consume our solar system and more. Regardless, everything we do in our lives is meaningless considering that from the moment of conception we are cursed the potential of dying at any moment. I say conception because we could be aborted during pregnancy and or killed through various other methods which I would go into more detail but I would probably be put into a home because of. Now. If we are successful in making it passed fetal development then we will spend the first, on average 25 years of our lives studying in hopes of getting a job that will suffice until we make enough money to retire. The sad fact is, with the growing cost of living these days the amount of money needed to retire is becoming increasing large and the retirement age has also been increasing. Let's face it. You're never going to retire. If you are successful retiring then there's not much more for you to do then just sit there until you die. Seriously. You have nothing important to do. Keep in mind that throughout any of the average 80 years of life you could die at any second. Kapoof. You're gone. So I think the best way to live life is to indulge. Who cares about others. Only care about yourself. They're all going to be dead anyway. So are you. Just indulge. Indulging is good. But if you're poor. Then life sucks even more.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-02-26T06:41:26.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Live your life to be happy. \nAnd celebrate that although Riot will someday close, it is open now, and brings many people hundreds of hours of happiness.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-02-26T23:31:32.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hhahahahahah.. did you just say \"hundreds\"?
