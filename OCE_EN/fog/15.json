League of Legends is very much a mental game. If you're mindset isn't right then your game play will suffer as a consequence. This is the definition of tilt. When a player makes a mistake, which I can safely say that everyone has done, then don't discourage the player and call them trash or say things like \"gg\" and or \"report x\" etc. This will just make that player feel worse. For the better good of your team and for a better chance of winning the game why not encourage the player and boost their moral? I've always gone under the belief that a team that fights amongst themselves has less a chance of winning a game than team of beginner bots. A team that can't function together can't win together. Like, there on your team for Christ's sake.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Terra","date":"2015-03-05T17:05:22.096+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always think of the quote \"You're already have 5 enemies in the game, why add more\".\n\nEveryone has bad games - maybe they are playing off-role or a champion they are unfamiliar with because their main was banned. Like OP said, I find it is better to default to encouragement. At very least it makes the game more enjoyable, even if you lose :","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-03-06T12:15:51.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some people would think that they could take on their entire team and come out on top","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Forever","date":"2015-03-05T00:32:47.569+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"To add on to OP's post, don't just encourage. Telling someone: \"It's okay, you'll do better next time,\" which is indeed encouraging, does not always help. Analyzing the mistake and having your teammate realize the solution is just as important. Do not be afraid to be critical and be supportive. Do not be condescending about it, just help your teammate learn and win the game. Remember, teamwork is OP.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-05T02:14:11.484+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Further adding to this, don't be ashamed of your mistakes; instead ask yourself, \"What could I have done differently to make that situation go better for me?\". Even when you win a trade it is possible to do this.\n\nIf you ask this of yourself every time you will not only improve as a player, you will respond more positively to other people's criticism (whether is happens to be constructive or not). You will also be able to give better critism as you are thinking how and what would have been a better decision rather than just telling someone it should of been better or it was a mistake.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-03-04T22:28:15.000+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah I know what you mean. once I encouraged our support and muted the rest of our team, and then after that, soraka was a major benefit late game.\nshe would have left if I didn't do that im sure if she did that the team fight in mid lane near the final push would have been a goner.\n\nI salute ye, supports","replies":[]},{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-03-20T02:29:32.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"only time I get very frustrated is if someone makes the same mistakes multiple times, remember to learn from your errors and try correct them, if you do something dumb, think \"what made that bad, what can I do to improve, how can I stop this from happening again\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"WhisperPan","date":"2015-03-19T04:40:59.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I.e kick up not down?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2015-03-06T23:03:09.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good post from the OP.
