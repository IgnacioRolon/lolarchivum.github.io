I just can&#039;t work out what the hell I&#039;m supposed to do against him.\r\nThe obvious answer is &quot;just build MR&quot; but by doing that it lessens my kill potential putting me in the same sort of position, stuck in a sustain lane with a bloody Malzahar who I can&#039;t burst down or poke effectively, but can poke me down and eventually burst me with a flash ignite ult spellspam combo unless I play ultra-safe (Which I do anyway sometimes, and still manages to get me, occasionally).\r\n\r\nSorry if this comes across as salty, I guess I am a little bit, but it&#039;s really frustrating too. I&#039;ve read almost every bit of information out there regarding Malz counters, and none seem particularly effective, or are simply out of date.\r\nI can deal with almost any champ in lane, even Yasuo, but Malzahar is the bane of my existence. \r\n\r\nHalp. \r\n_/","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-12-27T02:50:45.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One very very big tip is be aware of his nightmare tranferring.

Hes actually not very long range at all, and most longer ranged mages (including tf and syndra) can trade farm pretty easily aside from maybe missing a bit to the tower early on. The cast range on his DOT is not very big so he should never be able to cast it on you directly and you can avoid it jumping to you by stepping away from a minion that is about to die with it on. The only time he should have kill potential 1v1 is when he has flash up, and if you're that worried about it you can take barrier so he can't 100-0 you even when thats up. He also has no sustain aside from catalyst, so is quite susceptible to getting poked down and is really easy to gank since he has no dash/speed boost, no way to cc you and run, and has to push constantly to bully people.\nIf your looking for some way to easily crush him 1v1 in lane, you're probably not going to find it. You 'beat' him by going even or a bit ahead and being more useful later in the game (his lategame is only really good vs assassins since he has no way to get to the backline and is easy to focus down while hes ulting someone, and his ult becomes useless once people start getting qss), or by your jungler coming and killing him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2015-12-26T11:16:12.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"get qss and play safe,just let him burn mana and ask the jungler for a gank.He is extremely immobile so just build MR to sustain yourself and as soon as he burns all his mana you and your jungler can just all out him.","replies":[]}]}
