My second pref is support, but that doesn&#039;t mean I want it EVERY SINGLE DAMN GAME. I&#039;ve played 6 games, 5 have been my second pref role, and I have been through roughly 20 champ selects (with dodges) and only gotten my main role twice.\n\nTWICE.\n\nYeah I know what you are going to say, just change your second pref to jungle or something.\n\nI gave that a try (I&#039;m not that great at JG), and got jungle 3 out of 3 games (Luckily somebody dodged.)\n\nI don&#039;t mind waiting longer in the queue! I really don&#039;t Rito, just give me my main freakin&#039; role please, or revert to the old system. I used to be able to link my op.gg and people would give me mid.\nNow i'm forced to support, which I don't mind occasionally, but I much prefer being able to carry a game to secure the win - than relying on others. ESPECIALLY in my placements.\n\nOk, I'm finished whinging now.","replies":[]}
