I feel that I can play support confidently, adc averagely and am currently re-learning jng (ive been away from the game until this last couple weeks for some time).\nAm currently bouncing between the hell that is Bronze I and II, and it&#039;s starting to make my face hurt getting down-ranked constantly because of AFKs/trolls, so would like to find a competent, like-minded team.\n\nQuick details about myself, 26 year old guy, live in WA. Am a dedicated endgame raider on WoW (top tier content), achieved rank 1 on HoTS (top rank possible), and have played my fair share of Dota back in the day.\nI have played several other games competitively too, in the past. (Black Ops, BF1942 and the later BF franchises, Dota 2 BRIEFLY, CS S and CS GO, yada yada yada.)\n\nHappy to commit to any evenings/nights, except for Weds and Sun (I run another team in another game on those nights).\n\nIGN: **Kurizu**\nAlternate account (been playing it a bit lately): **Kurizu Senpai**\n\nI&#039;m confident in my abilities as a support, but I am by no means a god. I&#039;m always open to suggestions on how I could improve, as long as it&#039;s constructive.\n\nQuick edit: Naturally, as my rank isn't that special I'm not expecting invites from any Gold/Plat/Higher teams, but if anyone did want to give me a shot, I'll do my best to not disappoint.\nOther teams, your rank means little to me, I'll gladly join a team of any rank provided you are competent players and committed to progressing! ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"LostMind","date":"2015-10-02T12:34:30.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quick edit - \n\nIve been playing my alternate account a little lately, had a really rough time in ranked lately (6 or 7 AFKers / Feeding trolls in a row). \nI've tried to add all of you on it, but I might have missed some.\nFeel free to add it: Kurizu Senpai\n\nHave edited main post to reflect same info.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LostMind","date":"2015-10-01T07:19:49.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump.\n\nStill looking. \nMany adds, but none of them have messaged me, invited to a game, or a team. xD\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"PapaHuggey","date":"2015-09-27T10:29:25.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've sent you a friend request. :)","replies":[]}]}
