I&#039;ve also noticed slightly higher ping than usual fairly frequently, I have had a stable 58-60 ping for months, now suddenly I see it getting north of 70, this in itself isn&#039;t a huge issue but the packet loss is completely ruining the game for me.\r\n\r\nAnyone able to help?","replies":[{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2017-01-27T05:18:29.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Troubleshoot your connectivity issues.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/su16_keyart_1920x1080_0.jpg?itok=6nj8mHjj","replies":[{"poster":"LostMind","date":"2017-01-27T10:49:29.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, have done that already and came up empty handed (Worth noting that it ONLY happens with League, other online games are not effected)  - but hadn't had the chance to run ICSI yet (until now).
