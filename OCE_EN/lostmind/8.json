He calls me up explains, I tell him give it another 48 hours, this was early December, so with Christmas coming up I tried to reassure my mate telling him that people often go away before Christmas instead of during / after at a much cheaper rate.\n48 hours later still nothing, I&#039;m at his house this time, so I write the email for him, just a simple one along the lines of &quot;Hi Andre, purchased a boost from you 3 days ago but have not heard anything back from your employees, if you could, please contact me at your earliest convenience.&quot;\n7 days later, absolutely no contact, I try one last time for him, open up a ticket on their &quot;live help&quot; chat section of the website, and send the owner one last email too.\n48 hours go by, Ok he&#039;s been scammed. Help him open up a PayPal dispute to try recover his money (roughly 100 AUD), but my hopes were not high, admittedly I&#039;ve not paid for any services in LoL before (except RP, but that isn&#039;t the same thing), but I have brought currency on a similar site for another game before, and if they decide to scam you PayPal never finds in your favor, ever.\nA little time goes by, low and behold &quot;Andre&quot; is able to respond to PayPal promptly, PayPal forwards the conversation to my friend&#039;s email. the nerve of this guy, he actually gave PayPal a tracking number. An ACTUAL physical item tracking number and wrote &quot;it was sent, the buyer is lying&quot;. My eye begins to twitch a little...\n({{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} <--- Me) \nI tell my mate to let me write to PayPal on his behalf, short and sweet was my reply: &quot;A physical tracking number for a virtual purchase? .... Come on.... &quot;\nA little time goes by (over Christmas period) as PayPal investigate, I had previously told him just to write it off as a loss, it sucks but I&#039;ve never seen PayPal find in favor of the buyer in a case like this, in my entire life.\nFastforward to today, he gets an email, PayPal actually found in his favor. \n\nMy buddy wanted to write this to warn everyone, but I told him his account would be at risk of being banned if he came out and openly admitted to buying something like that, plus he kind of has a hard time getting his point across speachwise (He has mild autism) so I offered to do it on his behalf. Least he's learned his lesson though!\n\nLong story short, don&#039;t buy ELO boosting services chaps. It&#039;ll put you in a tier you don&#039;t belong, and 9/10 times you will be scammed out of your money. I can&#039;t comment on LoLskinshop&#039;s &quot;authenticity&quot; for the SKINS it also sells, but I have to assume they are scams too, so I would avoid buying if I were any of you. Just a PSA, if it stops even one person being ripped off then I&#039;m happy.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-12T00:40:10.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LMAO, y'all get what you deserve.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-30T02:51:09.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your friend should receive a ban for trying to do this honestly.","replies":[{"poster":"LostMind","date":"2015-12-30T13:16:00.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"To some degree, I agree with you. Kinda why I told him not to post it himself.\n\nBut anyway what's done is done, I just thought it would be a good idea to get this out there as I've actually seen several VERY popular YouTubers and streamers advertise the site. (No doubt they were paid to, but still pretty messed up that they are advertising a scam without knowing it).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2015-12-28T09:33:55.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your friends a retard and had it coming tbh.\nhe's lucky to have you as a friend","replies":[{"poster":"LostMind","date":"2015-12-28T09:49:52.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I guess, tbh if it was anybody else I would think the same as you do.

I was very happy with my purchase the account had over 25 skins decent runes, and a bit of IP on it.  However, two weeks later the account's info was changed on me(I changed the email, password, everything).  I tried contacting their support to get a different account to replace it and emailed their support, no response for days.  So I ended up making a dispute on Paypal and got my money back.  I still never got a reply from the owner or the support on the website.  Site is a fucking scam.","replies":[]}]}
