I&#039;m in bronze so you would think queue times would be relatively short.\n\nDuring the week I try to fit a game in after work but the queue times are extremely long so its touch and go. Its the weekend so I get a chance to play a bit more.  I&#039;ve currently been playing for about 2 hours and only got one game in (a stomp. Might have lasted 30min)\n\nDoes anyone have any insight into these queue times? Its getting to the stage where I will need to find a game I can actually get to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Kobayashi Maru","date":"2016-03-25T05:31:44.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Got this message after the last time someone forgot to ban\n\n'A player did not lock in their pick or ban.
