I&#039;ve made my peace with my long loading times, but right now I&#039;ve been running into an issue with connecting to the game at the start. These games are almost always remakes, and yeah, it sucks for those involved. However, recently I&#039;ve been getting hit with the leaverbuster, being put into low priority queues. This is fine, although it raises the question on whether my account is at risk of a permanent ban.\n\nI&#039;ve put quite a bit of time into the account, with oodles of skins and champs unlocked. If there&#039;s serious risk of the account being banned, I may need to just hold off league until I get a computer upgrade.\n\nAside from that, any tips and or solutions for people running into this similar problem? It&#039;s really annoying, because all my DC&#039;s are these pre game dc&#039;s and  getting punished for staring at a loading screen kinda blows.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-12T02:38:11.012+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A spoon? Frankly I'm impressed :P\n\nSome good news for you though, your account isn't at risk of a ban. AFK/leave behaviour won't result in any punishments beyond LeaverBuster, so you don't have to worry about that, though if you don't already I'd certainly recommend avoiding ranked for your and your team's sake.\n\nFirst things I would recommend:\n\n* Connect to ethernet if at all possible\n* Make sure your GPU drivers are up to date\n\nIf those don't help, check out some of the other fixes in this article:\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues\n\nFailing all of those, or if you are unsure how to follow some of those steps, submit a ticket to Player Support, and they should be able to help you further:\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"Kim Jong SkilI","date":"2018-10-18T10:08:24.455+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for that, I think I've fixed the problem, but it's still good to hear. The GPU drivers seemed to be the issue, got everything updated and haven't run into the problem since. Also started using ethernet as recommended!\n\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-18T11:38:58.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"GPU drivers can cause all sorts of weird issues you wouldn't think would be related, so it's pretty much always my first attempt if something isn't working right. Glad it worked out for you!\n\nEthernet isn't strictly required, but if you're internet isn't the most reliable, it can help, and makes you much less vulnerable to packet loss, so if it's possible and convenient, definitely worth having :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Slam H2017","date":"2018-10-11T19:15:48.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are using a laptop it is best to plug an Ethernet cable in if possible because that is faster than Wi-Fi.","replies":[]}]}
