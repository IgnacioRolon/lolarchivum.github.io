Just your average player trying to climb out of silver, and I came across a lot of Shaco players. I don&#039;t like Shaco, I find him to be a useless teamfighter and champion in general past the 15 minute mark. I was getting more and more annoyed, until I eventually told my duo buddy that I would genuinely rather have a player-controlled super minion than a Shaco. And that gave me the idea: why can&#039;t a minion be a champion? \nSo here he is.\nThe release could be coupled with a story update centred on the origin of minions or something. His name is a reference to a production line, just as an example backstory.\nHe is about malphites size. He&#039;s a minion on steroids basically.\nHis base stats are going to be fairly high, but his stat growth will be very low, probably the lowest of all champions. This is because of his special passive:\nPassive: the meek shall inherit\nGX-111 has no level cap.\nThere are many ways of making an infinitely scaling champion, and this is another. Of course I&#039;m tying in with the fact that all minions scale indefinitely. This could be unbalanced, fixable by lowering stat growth past level 18 or significantly decreasing experience gained post level 18. However, I think that having no passive for the first 30 minutes is a good trade-off, and this passive allows for useful synergies like Zilean&#039;s passive. \nQ: versatile combatant\nNo cost\nToggle\nGX-111 can change forms between melee minion and ranged minion as he pleases. In melee form, he gains 10/15/20/25/30 armor, magic resist, and % attack speed. In ranged form, he gains 400 range and his basic attacks are all converted to magic damage, dealing 60/65/70/75/80% of his attack damage as magic damage in a small AoE(same as Kayle&#039;s E). \nTo clarify, the ranged damage becomes his basic attack, it doesn&#039;t add on top of it, that would be stupid.\nMy idea behind this is that his melee form is his main duelling form, and his ranged form is used for early trading and late game split pushing. The magic damage is because it hurts minions more.\nW: we are the 99%\n40/50/60/70/80 mana\n30/28/24/22/20 second cooldown\nAll nearby minions/monsters change focus to target champion for 1/1.5/2/2.5/3 seconds(including enemy minions). during this time, target is slowed by 5/10/15/20/25%. Basic attacks on enemy champions reduce the cooldown by 1 second.\nThis ability is meant to allow him to survive early laning. With some cooldown reduction and attack speed, it becomes his bread-and-butter anti-kiting weapon. It also works well with his E\nE: of the minions, for the minions\n20 second cooldown\n50 mana at all ranks\nPassive: nearby allied minions gain 20/25/30/35/40 armor and magic resist and 5/10/15/20/25 attack damage. \nActive: this bonus is tripled for 8/9/10/11/12 seconds.\nThis combos well with his w, and also contributes to his playstyle as a farm-centric late game duellist and split pusher, using minions to assist him in combat and pushing.\nR: rise to power\n100 mana\n70/50/35 second cooldown\nGX-111 channels the super minion within him, gaining 20/30/40% size, losing 15/10/5% movement speed, and gaining 50/100/150 attack damage for 10/15/20 seconds. In melee form, he keeps his bonuses, in ranged form, he uses a cannon and the AoE increases.\nThis is boss mode. Hitting the late game and being able to have this at 100% uptime is part of what makes this guy a late game hypercarry.\n\nAs you can see, his late game-centric passive, focus on minions(who are inherently weak early and strong late) pushes him towards being a top lane farmer, another sort of Nasus. However, high cooldowns and mana costs coupled with low base stats and lack of sustain should adequately allow most laners to squash him in extended trades. Contributing to team fights is not this guy&#039;s forte. He has low base movement speed, and little real cc, but with a heavy cc team he&#039;s basically another juggernaut. His niche(I know a couple other champions have it filled) is focused on farming it up, and split pushing the enemy into the ground, duelling anyone foolish enough to fight him, even turning minions against them.\nBuilds would probably be attack speed based and tanky, to take advantage of his on-hit cooldown and stat buffs. I know some people will find this champion boring, but this is the kind of champion I like playing.\nThanks for reading, I know,I&#039;ve probably overturned the numbers a lot, but yeah, if you could rate it for me and give some constructive criticism I&#039;d be a happy man.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-02-24T00:21:56.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Great champion idea, but are you seriously comparing Shaco to a \"player controlled super minion\". I mean I would accept you been mad that the enemy team had a Shaco, because of his massive gank potential and annoyance in team fights, but if you had that many Shaco's that were useless in team fights then it's either they weren't playing him right, or the team wasn't coordinating correctly. \n\nShaco is always a good fighter and assassin, but he can perform well in team fights if played properly. His boxes are phenomenal crowd-control for initiation, and his clone fucks with people's mind so hard. He may not be the best actual team fighter once engaged, but he can start an initiation, take out a squishy, and get out for free.\n\nShaco is by no means useless past 15 minutes. As a matter of fact, he gets stronger at his job as the game goes on. Every champion has a role. Shaco is a assassin/fighter. Not all of these guys are meant to be fantastic at eliminating groups. In fact, I'm glad that players like you are still around thinking Shaco is bad, because then people can't ban him against me. The later the game gets, the more assassin and 1v1 potential Shaco has. \n\nOnce he gets Shiv, Infinity Edge and Duskblade, there isn't much the enemy team can do to stop him, unless the Shaco is actually bad. That been said, there are a lot of bad Shaco players these days so I can see where you might get this hate for him. Oh and if I'm coming off douchly as Shaco wasn't the main topic of this article, I would appreciate it if you forget about this comment and NEVER ban Shaco in ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Cancer","date":"2016-02-24T13:04:50.855+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I asked for feedback on my champion, not opinions on Shaco.
