He was too calm; too _cheery_ and blas&eacute; about their work. Right now, for instance, he was laying back on a pile of red pillows as Zilean gave him news of their members. \r\nThe demon who shared his skin hissed at the cardslinger, though never for long, and never too loudly. The one that slithered under Fate&#039;s mask was harsh and abrupt, and had little tolerance for upstarts.\r\n\r\n&quot;What&#039;s the word from Kennen?&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;His plans are in motion. Ackrene Citadel will topple within the week.&quot;\r\n\r\nTwisted Fate hummed, pleased, flipping a card between his fingers. It shimmered with flecks of light - blue, red, yellow - each twist painting it with a new face.\r\n\r\n&quot;&rsquo;Bout time they got out of our way.&quot; \r\n\r\nFate tilted his head toward the man standing with his back to the wall, posture tall and proud, white and red mask gleaming in the gloom. \r\n\r\n&quot;Won&#039;t that be fun, ay Shen? How&#039;s about you spend some time with your little buddy when he gets back?&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;That will not be necessary.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Huh. I thought you two were best pals.&quot;\r\n\r\nZilean&#039;s gaze flickered to Shen, their ferocious and unflinching bodyguard. In the early days - before their numbers swelled to include hostless demons - Shen, Kennen and Akali had been great allies. They&#039;d come to Fate, seeking power, seeking a means to overthrow the monster who&#039;d violently evicted them from their temple home in the mountains. \r\n\r\nFate gave them power. \r\n\r\nHe bestowed upon them three demons. Zilean still remembered the ritual. It was the first time they&#039;d invoked so many demons at once - and the last. Jhin, simply an avid observer and documenter at that time, had prepared the ceremony. Their leader had led the ritual, and the three ninja had surrendered to the demons that came through. But it had been nothing like previous rites. Two of the ghastly wraith-like spectres had collided, shrieking and yowling through the night, screams bloodcurdling. They battled to possess host they had both chosen. Zilean was not privy to knowing which of the males had been hard fought for. That was something the hosts had kept to themselves, even to this day. \r\n\r\nEver since, Kennen and Shen had stayed far, _far_ apart from each other. Akali had been oddly indifferent about their sudden separations. She spent her nights under the light of their revered blood moon, staring at it, meditating. She, at least, seemed to have synergy with the demon in her flesh. \r\n\r\nOne thing they all had in common was that they seemed happy to forget entirely about the _reason_ they&#039;d sought the Blood Moon at all. Now, the Order of Shadows was a - sometimes if not begrudging - ally. They doubted the Blood Moon&#039;s power, scoffing at their members and calling them &#039;fanatics&#039;. Fate would dismiss it with a laugh and a hapless shrug, as if to say &#039;Oh well, what can we do?&#039;. \r\n\r\nThe Order of Shadows could not, however, afford to be completely ignorant. The talent for haphazard and indiscriminate destruction that spawned from several of the Blood Moon&rsquo;s more..._unstable_ members was not a weapon they wanted aimed at them.\r\n\r\n&quot;What word on the movements of Kalista and Evelynn?&quot;\r\n\r\nZilean blinked, the voice of his leader pulling him to focus.\r\n\r\n&quot;Evelynn is currently making her way through Demacia. Her last missive gave mention of a potential new member on the Freljordian border.&quot;\r\n\r\nFate sat up abruptly, crushing the card into his palm with a puff of red smoke. \r\n\r\n&quot;Did she really? What else did she say?&quot;\r\n\r\nZilean felt his demon squirm as Fate&#039;s own exuded a heavy aura, oppressive and dominant. There was more information and they sensed it immediately.\r\n\r\n&quot;She...wants to venture north, after her meal in Demacia.&quot;\r\n\r\nRed haze choked at the candle-light suddenly, smothering the room in uncomfortable, stuffy darkness. Zilean grimaced behind his mask as he heard shrill screaming in his ear. It was a demons. He wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was his own, cowering in submission, or Fate&rsquo;s, howling in anger.\r\n\r\n_**&quot;Absolutely not.&quot;**_\r\n\r\nFate&#039;s voice was distorted, the demon&#039;s hiss bleeding through.\r\n\r\n_***&quot;There are things in the Freljord that must not be disturbed. Not yet. She is to return after she&#039;s finished with the town, with or without the new meat.&quot;***_\r\n\r\n&quot;Yes, Master.&quot; \r\n\r\nZilean bowed his head, voice small. A shudder rolled down his back. He could feel the sweat that had broken out across his skin; the goose bumps and the hairs standing on end all over him. \r\nHis demon was silent.\r\n\r\nWarm, dim light returned to the room, and Fate eased back into his sprawl, leaning back into the crimson cushions. He lifted his hand and unfurled his fingers, another card flashing into being and dancing between them.\r\n\r\n&quot;Good.&quot;\r\n\r\nZilean swallowed slowly, sparing a glance toward the ever silent Shen.\r\nHe&#039;d not moved a muscle.\r\n\r\n&quot;And Kalista...?&quot; Twisted Fate prompted, irritation lacing his tone.\r\n\r\nZilean inhaled and looked back to Fate. \r\n\r\n&quot;Kalista is in Bilgewater. Her taste for vengeance has apparently found it in great supply among the lawless and betrayed.&quot;\r\n\r\nNothing but a bemused snort from Fate at that.\r\n\r\n&quot;Thresh has also accompanied Elise to the Isles.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Why?&quot; Fate asked sharply.\r\n\r\n&quot;He requested something with a little more _tenacity_ to pass his time. &#039;Flesh can only provide so much.&#039; were his exact words.&quot; \r\n\r\nFate seemed to mull this over before approving it with a subtle nod.\r\n\r\n&quot;That is all from our members abroad.&quot; Zilean finished.\r\n\r\n&quot;Mhm. Now, leave us.&quot;\r\n\r\nZilean bowed and turned, floating from the room without another word.\r\n\r\nThe weighted _fwip_ of Twisted Fate flipping his magical card resonated in the otherwise silent room for some time, until he chose to break it.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You too, Shen.&rdquo; Fate commanded, rising smoothly from his recline.\r\n\r\nThe ninja was gone before he&rsquo;d even put a foot on the stairs.\r\n\r\nDown he walked from his seat of power, down the cold, dark stone steps.\r\n\r\n_&lsquo;The north cannot be disturbed.&rsquo;_ Prowled the voice in his skull, in his blood, in his very flesh and soul.\r\n&lsquo;I know.&rsquo; \r\n_&lsquo;It must not. Not until we have **more.**&rsquo; _\r\n**&lsquo;I know.&rsquo;** He pushed back, firm and growling.\r\n\r\nHis demon settled, satisfied, coiling back around his body like a comfortable extra layer, wrapping him in a cocoon of its malefic energy.\r\n\r\nThere were no mirrors in the temple they&rsquo;d seized as their base.\r\n\r\nTobias found himself aching for one sometimes, but his partner hated mirrors. It smashed every single one it found, shattering it into tiny sharp particles of glass with an ethereal scream.\r\n\r\nHe used to wonder why.\r\n\r\nReally, he thought as he slowly ambled to the right side of the room, Elise was lucky that she&rsquo;d only grown a few extra legs and some shapeshifting out of her eager symbiosis. \r\n\r\nIt was unfortunate, in his eyes, that his partner wasn&rsquo;t a looker &ndash; not in the slightest. \r\n\r\nTobias used to hide his face in the shadows of a hat. Zilean had preferred face paint. \r\nAnd then Jhin joined the team, enamoured by their strange ways and the darkness of their partners from beyond. With an extravagant flourish and some smooth words &ndash; albeit vague and too artsy-fartsy for Tobias&rsquo; tastes &ndash; he&rsquo;d committed his body, soul and world-class aim to their cause. \r\n\r\nHe had also brought with him their most definitive visual trait: masks. \r\n\r\nJhin had been almost _giddy_ at the prospect of designing dramatic, menacing masks for new additions. He&rsquo;d taken it upon himself to design and commission each one, unique to each member.\r\n\r\nTobias dragged his fingertips over the cold white porcelain &ndash; or was it really bone? He couldn&rsquo;t tell. It felt more like his face than the flesh underneath it now.\r\n\r\nHe&rsquo;d never thanked Jhin. The virtuoso never really asked for it either. He seemed to take pride in the fact that they were simply wearing them. Whatever the case, Tobias had grown fond of his new face. It would never be as good as _his_, but it was better than _its_.\r\n\r\nOf course, Tobias mused, leaning against the open stone bannister of the temple&rsquo;s topmost level, Jhin always did seem _upset_ when they summoned forth a demon with enough power to manifest and sustain itself. Kalista, Thresh and Evelynn &ndash; Evelynn especially &ndash; had each left him in a foul mood for a solid week after they joined. \r\n\r\nHe still remembered Jhin coming to him, furious, muttering and hissing under his breath &ndash; or had it been his demon&rsquo;s? &ndash; with righteous anger. \r\n\r\n_&ldquo;She REFUSES a mask!&rdquo;_ he&rsquo;d declared, outraged. _&ldquo;She said-! She said that something so &lsquo;ugly&rsquo; would &lsquo;spoil her appetite&rsquo;! The NERVE!&rdquo;_\r\n\r\nHe&rsquo;d gone on a half our rant about how special their masks were, and Tobias had spent a good half hour soothing his temper.\r\n\r\nTobias grinned lazily behind the pale fa&ccedil;ade. His life wasn&rsquo;t the same as before. It wasn&rsquo;t better, but perhaps, he thought, eyes hooked on the full moon dangling in the night sky, that was for the best.","replies":[{"poster":"ZÅ“ X Lulu Hentai","date":"2018-09-29T15:17:29.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is fucking awesome geez Louise, nice work!!","replies":[]}]}
