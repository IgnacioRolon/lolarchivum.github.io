What you need to keep in mind is that Nasus is pretty much a timer on the game. The longer a game goes, the more powerful his q becomes. Knowing that, you should always aim to get as many stacks as you can as early as possible. But honestly, if you're getting that many stacks it sounds like your timer is 40 minutes till god mode nasus.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Staldy","date":"2016-03-27T07:43:33.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sirchez (Probably the best western Nasus player) looks to be around 400 at 20.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VeganCrossfitter","date":"2016-03-27T05:23:25.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If i haven't reached 500 by about 22-25 minutes, then i consider the game a failure on my behalf","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-03-27T00:05:11.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your stacks should improve enormously when you reach 30-45% cdr.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-03-26T23:28:02.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"100 at 10 and 300 at 20 is the minimum you should be aiming for.\n\n400-500 at 20 is usually pretty good.
