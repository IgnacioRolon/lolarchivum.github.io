What is her actual breast size?\r\n2. Will Red Card Kata be released again? Its the only skin for kata that I don&#039;t have \r\n3. What are your plans for her with the assassin rework that is upcoming at the end of this year? She seems like one of the characters that you will change although on the Katarina Mains reddit and after talking to the majority of Katarina mains we all agree that she honestly doesn&#039;t need it.. She has noticeable counter play (This is one of the things riot loves)  and to play her to an extremely high level it takes hundreds of games, I really feel as if you should focus on other assassins before working on her &quot;zed cough cough&quot; I mean the whole communities complaining about him at the moment.\r\n4. Does riot hate or love me? It would be a {{champion:55}} astrophe if they didnt love me ;)\r\n5. This is more an exclamation than a question although with the introduction of dynamic queue, there was a large in direct nerf to Katarina as she is great against unorganised teams although does not do very well vs teams with great communication and synergy. I feel like you guys haven&#039;t compensated for it.\r\n\r\nThanks Guys!\r\n- Katlife! :D {{champion:55}} {{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}}","replies":[{"poster":"DravensNation","date":"2016-05-18T22:40:20.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PS: Anyone can reply about these questions","replies":[]}]}
