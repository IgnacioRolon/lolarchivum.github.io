Now I know. Its because of this RECONNECT BUTTON\n\nFor some reason,\n\n(1). every time Champion Select ends and the game is about to boot up, It flashes &quot;Game Still in Progress&quot; for about 0.8 seconds and then reverts to this &quot;Reconnect&quot; button.\n\n(2). Every time I click the &quot;Reconnect&quot; button, it does not enter the game or reconnect, but repeats (1)\n\nI think I may have quit this game months ago because I had this issue and there were no clear solutions. Even though I havent actually connected it still counts me as AFK and I am probably going to have a LPQ again. This is EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING because it basically means I have to wait 20+ minutes to see if something I&#039;ve done has fixed the connection issue! Its rubbish!\n\nBut on topic, is there any way to fix this?\n\nI have a MacBook Air, \n\nFirewall is Off, \n\nDNS is 100% how it should be,\n\nI have no applications running that I know of besides LoL, \n\nIve switched my ISP since last I logged in,\n\nI cleared all data including in App Support and did a fresh reinstall\n\n\nyet still this Reconnect Trap persists. \n\nIts so annoying. I found out that I can test the game with a custom match to avoid getting LPQ&#039;d but nope, even in those games I still get the reconnect button limbo after champion select. Trying to play a tutorial game just greys over the &quot;Play Game&quot; button once you press it, and you have to restart the client. Its like it refuses to boot up the ACTUAL game for some reason, which is just weird because it worked on this very computer just fine about 10 months ago and for years before that!!!\n\nAlso, another cruddy thing is that the Hextech repair tool glitches out whenever I download it, there is no text except for zeroes and I cant leave the program without force quitting. \n\nIt might be a font problem, maybe, idk. When I ran it through terminal multiple errors stating \n\n\"detected broken kqueue; not using.: Undefined error: 0\"\n\nwhich was followed by :\n\n\"2018-09-08 18:22:26.845 HextechRepairTool Helper[32103:70941425] XType: failed to connect -
