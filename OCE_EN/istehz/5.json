Cover up the left half of the screen where his cursor is and just watch his champ and you can see the stutter. Obviously it's most noticeable on the cursor since that's generally what we're most aware of, and less obvious on his champ because it's moving in a predictable and smooth, and much slower fashion where the cursor does not.\n\nIf this is a recent issue, I would look at doing things like a clean re-install of the game (via the Hextech Repair Tool), and cleaning out space on his hard drive. A too-full hard drive, especially on HDDs can cause problems that could well manifest in this manner.\n\nFailing that, I'd submit a ticket to player support and they can help him further: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nDepending on how old/low-spec his PC is, and given that it occurred here in a team-fight and levelled out after that, it could be a case of his actual hardware not keeping up too.","replies":[{"poster":"Istehz","date":"2019-12-23T03:13:11.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it was a frame-rate issue wouldn't everything be stuttering and not just himself? At least to me, it seems more like stream lag more than anything that you're referring to but I will suggest the clean reinstall and computer space clean up.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-12-23T10:14:28.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, it appears that everything is stuttering, it's just most noticeable on cursor and character because they have the most intricate movement (and thus it's easier to tell when frames are jumping).","replies":[]}]}]}]}
