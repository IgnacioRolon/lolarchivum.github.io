With the new ap items, he received ANOTHER indirect nerf, due to the fact that the item is now cheaper and easier to get against him. Opinions on his state and where he should go from here? What buffs should be given to him to compensate for his nerfs if any at all? Any comments from Riot?","replies":[{"poster":"xFaker","date":"2015-07-10T09:00:21.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play bard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-07-08T01:35:49.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They nerfed cumulative slows too so Cutlass or Botrk and E wont stack only the larger slow will apply (his E).\n\nZhonya's is weaker now though so while getting needless will be faster the power spike of having Zhonya's wont be as good and it sort of sucks having to build it against him anyway with what were good and what are now even better options (Luden's and Deathcap) so really he's actually stronger now excluding the nerfed slow because we are excluded from what were good and what are now even better options because they are insanely risky and glass cannon (All the HP items are basically detrimental because of his Botrk build and his % missing HP damage so they're basically ruled out too) and Zhonya's is weaker late game...\n\nPlus his % missing HP damage is magic so really Zed is as OP as always with no counter-building other than Zhonya's and literally no counterplay other than CC and burst him repeatedly while he has jukes, becomes untargetable and punishes commit's whilst still getting off a huge combo if you don't use flash and can flash to use his ulti then W away to escape counter-harass and has good sustain and wave clear and insane range so really I don't think Zed has changed much - if anything he'll be more annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-07-08T02:55:11.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The active of Zhonyas is what makes it strong on certain champions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"22 5 19 20 1","date":"2015-07-08T01:52:52.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"zed is fine atm","replies":[]}]}
