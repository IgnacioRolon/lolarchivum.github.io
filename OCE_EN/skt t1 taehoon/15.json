Today star guardian jinx came out  now this skin had been so hyped up and now that ive played it non stop for 10 hours i see why riot hadn't made a  new jinx skin  since slayer jinx came out ( which i have) i have been waiting for a jinx skin every time the live sever patches came though i knew a new patch would be on pbe and i would check websites to see what skins are new and in coming for a long time i didn&#039;t see a jinx one ( i saw the project ones and daum) but then a few weeks/ months i looked and i saw &quot; New Star Guardian Skins Lulu,Lux,Poppy,Janna and Jinx&quot; i wiped my eyes i pinched my self to make sure i wasnt dreaming&quot; I rushed to youtube to see all those pbe youtubers showing it off and i fell in love i knew it was the skin i had been waiting for. Every day i would watch another pbe video. Today when i was watching worlds ( #RipG2 )i saw the trailer and i Ran to my computer ( as i watch worlds on tv ) I logged in i saw nothing about star guardians on home page but i went to the shop to see if anything was on sale. AND BOOM STAR GUARDIANS. for a second i went crazy did my am i awake checks. I thought my skin is finally in game i checked my rp i was 130 short. So i was running around my house trying to find my credit card. I found it i ran to my laptop and topped up $5 just enough for skin and hextech box and key . I was so happy. I loaded up a custom game and omfg. The homeguards Animation SHE FLYS. i tested out all the new animations taunts as i put caitlyn bot ( please tell me other taunts against champions ) And riot I know i give you guys alot of shit all the time on the boards but. For once i wanna say thank you this skin is perfect i dont think il be using my other 3 jinx skins for a long time now.\n\nPS: Thank you riot as a Jinx Main i am so happy with this skin you guys did a good job. I am so happy\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-10-08T02:02:55.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://giphy.com/gifs/leagueoflegends-pOH0d2GEbnmtG","replies":[]},{"poster":"xDarkRavenx","date":"2016-10-07T18:46:51.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suck so much at Jinx rip, been playing her for a long time but still not good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-10-07T11:13:13.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What level mastery, and best rating on jinx this season?\n\nI'm level 4 mastery Jinx with an S as my best this season (got her last season)","replies":[{"poster":"SKT T1 Taehoon","date":"2016-10-07T17:58:26.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mastery 7 with 150k Mastery points and S+ on my 42/4/3 game\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]}]}
