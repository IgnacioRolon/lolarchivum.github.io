Sure a glitch/bug will pop up occasionally and cause a game crash, but like you said, this is the first time you have left in over a year so it isn't that common. If it is happening often, perhaps it is time to check your PC/internet connection/ [common bugsplat](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) fixes to prevent this from happening again.\n\n> think i should get something from riot because of this bull shit your game has a bug which i get i get punished for it \n\nNope. That isn't how it works. Also, you unfortunately [won't be able to be removed from LPQ ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ#h3q6). I would suggest finding some nice relaxing youtube videos to watch while you wait. \n\n>i spent money every week over $100 in the last month and yes** this doesnt give me rights to anything** but ffs i spent over $2500 on this game\n\nSelf explanatory.\n\n>Jax is one of the most banned champions in ranked so you buff his passive trolls in ranked are higher bronze is un-climb able but no what does riot work on champions and skin every fucking week to take more money from us.\n\n* [Jax's ban rate is at 20%, but only for Bronze. It drops down to 17% at silver, 9% at gold and less than 3% for plat +](http://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/jax/bronze). The buff was probably to make him a more viable top laner.\n* There is a difference between ranked trolls and bad players. You are most likely experiencing the latter due to the fact you are bronze 5. I am not denying that trolls exist, because I know they do, its just that they are far less common than everyone makes out. \n* Bronze isn't unclimbable, it is just hard. \n* The teams that makes skins and champs are completely different to the balancing team and the bug teams. \n\n>to make us fork out money for you fix your shit \n\nLastly, League of Legends is a **FREE TO PLAY** game. Not only is it free to play, but it isn't pay to win like some other games on the market. Putting money into the game is purely for aesthetic purposes, and it won't give you an edge over your opponents (hence why you can't buy runes for RP). You have no obligation to spend money on this game.","replies":[{"poster":"SKT T1 Taehoon","date":"2016-04-18T03:57:10.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So if its not pay to win how come some skins are banned in LCS some skins make projectiles smaller and harder to see \nand bronze is hell i won 8-2 in placements and got bronze 5 now this didnt just piss me off it made me so angry trolls in bronze are becoming higher and more common now tell me this riot you have a banning system now tell me this if a player reports another player why the fuck would you make them play with each other again and again on a daily basis i have to report 10 players feeders toxic and afks when i report these players not saying names ( Jupiter mouse ) ( most well known troller in lol ) why the fuck would you match me with him \n\nfinally you sit in the 20 minutes then queue takes 13 more minutes as support and fill ffs brah sort this out plz and i should have my lpq removed as it was a riot bug that caused it in the first place","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-04-18T04:20:48.395+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">So if its not pay to win how come some skins are banned in LCS some skins make projectiles smaller and harder to see \n\nA lot of these have been fixed for clarity's sake, and the effect they have isn't gamebreakingly pay to win. \n\n> bronze is hell i won 8-2 in placements and got bronze 5\n\nSeason placements are all to do with your hidden match making rating (MMR). [At the beginning of season everyone who has played ranked endures a soft reset](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/competitive/2016-ranked-season-kicks-soon), where their MMR drops a bit from where they ended last season (preseason climbs effect this, but usually only if you have climbed significantly, which you didn't). Saying this, from what people posting on reddit/boards/facebook pages experienced, it usually takes 7+ wins just to stay where you are. \n\nNote: Riot keeps everything to do with MMR top secret, and this is only what I assume happens, based on numerous posts on the topic.\n\n>trolls in bronze are becoming higher and more common \n\nThey aren't that common. I have played my way out of bronze 5, and am currently sitting mid silver. Recently I have been queuing with my low bronze friend, and while I can say that players are bad, not every game is full of trolls. In fact, I have had only one intentional feeder out of the last 30 games. Had heaps of people going 0/8 by 10 minutes, but not by choice. They were just playing like one would assume a low elo would, and being out of position/overextending/making dumb mistakes. \n\n>riot you have a banning system now tell me this if a player reports another player why the fuck would you make them play with each other again and again on a daily basis i have to report 10 players feeders toxic and afks when i report these players not saying names ( Jupiter mouse ) ( most well known troller in lol ) why the fuck would you match me with him\n\nBecause the population is too small to do this. If this were a thing, you can just block every player that has a bad game. You will be in queue for hours. I went through your match history, full of bad players (bronze 5), only a couple of trolls. Maybe some toxins (I can't see chat logs). \n\n**Please remove the name, no naming and shaming on the boards**. Also, what makes him a troll? The fact he is a teemo main? His scores are what I would expect from your average player, not anything jumping out at me right now screaming \"troller\".\n\nBecause you have to be matched with someone. Only X people in queue at any given time for your mmr bracket. That number is then divided by the roles (albeit not evenly, most will queue for top and mid). The number isn't big enough to accommodate you not wanting to play with certain players. \n\nOf course, there is something you can do to eliminate these types of players in your games, you can create and join a premade team. Along with the prospect of no toxins in your game, you also get extra IP, mastery points and hex tech loot. \n\n>finally you sit in the 20 minutes then queue takes 13 more minutes as support and fill \n\nProbably due to you playing at times where there aren't many people queued up. \n\n> i should have my lpq removed as it was a riot bug that caused it in the first place\n\n[Still not happening](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ#h3q6)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-04-18T04:21:34.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the issue might be caused by your name.
