The rework and skins teams are completely different from each other, let a lone all the gameplay coding team. \n\nIt sucks that bugs happen sometimes, and it sucks even more that you had to experience such a big one in a ranked game.\n\n LPQ punishments can be handed out even after 1 ranked leave, as ranked is seen as a more competitive environment and players get extra-frustrated if someone has to go in the middle of their game (no matter what the reason). Even if you only DC for the first 5ish minutes, you still put your team at a disadvantage, and players can start tilting off this.\n\nYou won't be taken out of LPQ unfortunately, but it might be a good idea to flick [Riot support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) a ticket, detailing the bug you encountered. It may give you some proof to show your friends you aren't a troll.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-11-03T09:51:48.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=im a teemo ,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=lkkIGRUf,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-11-03T09:47:20.492+0000)\n>\n> so riotis bringing out like 9 reworks 9 new skins but they cant even fix shit that even pros get well that shows how fucked rito gams are\n\nits the repent for retards who don't know what the fuck a stun is.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
