(Reminder this is ranked ) \r\n\r\n\r\nNow every single time i play normals my game runs perfect its a good 150fps thats what im used to playing on. But when ever i ranked it takes like 7  minutes to load in and i load in and get freezes or like from my post the other day pathing bugs and reconnecting horror. but yet when i play norms it is fine the problems only happen when i try to play ranked even game modes are perfect but the second i go to ranked boom problems for days now theres at this current time just under 21 hours to season end i got fucked over in placements at the start of the season fucked over witht he alpha cilent match found accept buttons which cost me almost 2 whole ranks ( b3 - b5 ) and i got nothing from riot not a sorry nothing so i try play ranked and climb but how can i climb as a adc main with freezing games when i have to last hit cs perfectly and kite in fights. \r\n\r\nNow i want feedback from  RIOTER not some wench men no i want to hear from a Rioter them selfs why when i play norms its fine but as soon as i play ranked i get this shit. \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks - Im a Teemo","replies":[]}
