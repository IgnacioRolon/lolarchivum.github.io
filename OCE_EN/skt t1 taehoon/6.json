Someone correct me if I'm wrong but it also takes into account CS, objective assists (drag, baron, inhibs, towers) and as mentioned above your lane choice for that champ, lane presence aswell.\nI scored my mastery 6 with ashe with an S game that had less kills, more deaths and less assists than a previous game which I scored an A- on. But I believe that's because i had more CS, took a dragon, helped with baron 3 times and took a few inhibs solo.
