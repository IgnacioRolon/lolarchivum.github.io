There are going to be supporters of each side, and most of us would probably swap between the two depending on the exact situation we're in.)\n\nLook, I know both are frustrating. All I'm saying is I have a feeling that for a large portion of the player population the former is, and probably _still_ is, more frustrating than the latter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-11-15T00:54:43.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it seems pretty fair to me, and it should be a 3-1 vote.\nI've had about 10 remakes, and none of them failed as a 2-2 vote.\n\nNot sure if its changed, or its bugged.

Couldn't people just abuse this and join games which are nearly over and are winning to get LP easily? Everyone would have to reload into the game again if someone wanted to fill in for an AFK because they aren't connected to that person. What happens if someone wants to load into a game but they don't have the skin/champion/mastery level of the person who afk'd?\n\nSorry, but your idea creates more problems than it fixes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-11-15T01:49:54.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had 2 occasions where at the moment we remake, or the enemy team remaked, the person supposedly \"AFK\" types in chat \"wtf\", or something along those lines.\n\nMaybe they should increase the time for remake, to like 4 or 5 mins.
