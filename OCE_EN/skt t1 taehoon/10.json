People can submit a report for anything they want, but unless it's considered a punishable offense it won't count against you.\n\nThe warning popup just means you have been reported more than the average; it does not necessarily mean you will be punished, as the reports have not been verified for accuracy yet. All it is is a heads up you are being reported frequently.","replies":[{"poster":"SKT T1 Taehoon","date":"2016-01-28T05:29:59.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"no 4 people from that game reported me got told in after game screen just before i quit to home page","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-01-28T09:06:53.796+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"No\" what? I don't think you understood what I said. Reports against you won't get you punished if they are false, no matter how many people make them.\n\nThat warning popup does not mean you are going to get punished, it's literally only telling you that you were reported a lot.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ApeX SlowZ","date":"2016-01-28T05:44:00.954+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"if I had a person named \"im a teemo\" in my game id probably report you too ahahah","replies":[{"poster":"Bytez","date":"2016-01-28T09:17:25.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1 Made me laugh XD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Taliyahs huge","date":"2016-02-02T00:10:46.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played a game as Fizz in aram and got a ridiculously good score but we lost.\nI kept saying ez after a kill and after the game ended i got three offensive language pop ups.
