In his village &lsquo;the void&rsquo; was nothing but a story told to scare the infants. He reluctantly got out of bed and the dream quickly got lost in his mind as he continued his duties. On the front lines of the battlefield people are known to be stressed even in sleep. Qaik was first up and ready to fight. \r\n&ldquo;Good Sleep, Qaik?&rdquo; questioned the General Jarvan IV.\r\n&ldquo;Actually a bit restless, sir&rdquo;, Qaik hesitated.\r\n&ldquo;Well then maybe a bit of fighting to livin&rsquo; up your spirits&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Some would beg to differ&rdquo; Qaik retorted\r\n&ldquo;Did you say something Private?&rdquo; \r\n&ldquo;No, Sir!&rdquo; In a mocking salute.\r\n&ldquo;You really play your hand dangerously there Qaik&rdquo; came meec still obviously half asleep.\r\n&ldquo;All we are to them are numbers on a chalkboard. If we die the only thing they really care about is they are one number less.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Well it&rsquo;s too early in the day for this deep nonsense. Let&rsquo;s just get our orders first.&rdquo;\r\nJust like every other day Qaik and meec are assigned to their usual posts side by side in the trenches. It can actually be quite peaceful out there in the morning. Not many people are up. Maybe the odd gunshot but nothing out of the ordinary. &ldquo;Hey Meec do you actually want to partake in winning the war&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Ahh nah I&rsquo;ll sit this one out, you can have all the credit of winning the war by shovelling some dirt out of the trench.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Well if that&rsquo;s how you win wars the-&ldquo;\r\nA cold sweat broke over his back, short of breath, lines of agony scarred his face. Everything was dark, his only hope of light was the sliver of glowing bands around his wrist. Qaik stood and took a blind step in any direction. The moment he took his step of faith a purple glow illuminated his surroundings. Behind him a large flat wall was before him blocking the path. But interestingly the wall had seemed to be ripped open. The glowing edges of the wall were scorching to touch and behinf the wall&hellip;&hellip; nothing. Not light, not death, not warmth. He woke. \r\n&ldquo;heyyy there he is&hellip; Hey I don&rsquo;t think we won the battle today. Not enough trenches dug as you were interrupted,&rdquo; laughed Meec hysterically\r\nQaik sat in silence trying to comprehend what he saw.\r\n&ldquo;Qaik, you look like you&rsquo;ve seen a ghost, I mean you did just get hit in the helmet with a stray bullet so I guess you have an excuse&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that,&rdquo; Qaik replied softly. \r\n&ldquo;Then what is it?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;A touch of the void,&rdquo; \r\n&ldquo;Okay I think you may have gotten hit harder than you think,&rdquo; Meec cautioned.\r\nAt that moment Qaik started convulsing. His arms were uncontrollable, his mouth was frothing like a rabid animal, he broke into a cold sweat, lines of affliction scarred his face. \r\n&ldquo;The VOID! The VOID&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo; Qaik screamed from his nightmares &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take me!&rdquo; Qaik&rsquo;s body was arched completely standing on his toes to his shoulders. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing! Nothing. Nothing there.&rdquo;\r\nQaik was stuck in the same loop of phrases until his body collapsed. Meec ran over to him, perplexed on what had happened. Qaik woke with a start. Looked Meec Straight in the eyes and held his gaze. \r\n&ldquo;So what did you see? Was it real? What was it like&hellip;.the void I mean. You said there was nothing, you kept saying it, Nothing, nothing, nothing,&rdquo; Meec was overflowing with sky questions all the while Qaik stared him in the eyes.\r\nWith a weird sense of energy Qaik gently speculated &ldquo;Qaik was wrong. There is something in the void.\r\n&ldquo;Life&hellip;.&rdquo;","replies":[{"poster":"Wim Tinton","date":"2018-03-06T12:03:48.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Valdaglerion,\n\nInteresting concept, I like the idea of someone not believing the Void is real and then being slowly taken over. But doesn't J4 _know_ the Void is real? Perhaps it would be better to move the 'soldiering' to somewhere a bit more out of the way, where Jarvan is a bit of a myth?\n\nI also like the ending, but the journey there needs a little fleshing out. Qaik's character especially (I still don't know what he looks like!) Maybe think of some backstory you can drop in there. This would add greater impact to his being taken over by the Void at the end of the piece.\n\nSome extra description would also give the reader a clearer view of the world, and what's happening to your characters. \n\nRemember to tag enough of your dialogue (with \"she said\" and \"he said\" you don't need as many adverbs like \"retorted\" etc.) so the reader can follow who's saying what. Also try to differentiate the voices of your character's dialogue. \n\nSorry if this seems like a lot of criticism, but I think most of it is constructive. You don't have to agree with everything I've said, it's your piece, and at the end of the day you're the writer ;)\n\nBest of luck,\n\n~Wim","replies":[{"poster":"Valdaglerion","date":"2018-03-07T09:35:18.875+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a lot i really appreciate your advive and will definitely update this copy in the future.
