Every cut scene I have watched even the warriors film clip makes me want to play League of Legends more and more. For the last week I have played League of Legends for 6+ hours and I would love to see more participators in the game. The last update you realised was really cool and the story for {{champion:92}} and {{champion:157}} is a great idea. The next cut scene should be on blood moon for the reason you will have limited champions to generate in the animation, it will promote blood moon and League of Legends at the same time. Please take my Idea in to consideration.\n\nHotshot0574","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-06-16T15:28:16.469+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its called a cinematic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-06-17T02:25:30.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://imgur.com/1tA18n0","replies":[]}]}
