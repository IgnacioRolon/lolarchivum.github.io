Like you being the developers, get your shit together, WHAT in the world is even 400 isolation damage from khazix with only 1 long sword, he hasnt even completed his warrior yet. how is that even viable, yi&#039;s ult is 7 seconds, khazix ult has 2 x 1 second charges, yi ult for example is 7 seconds, which leaves only 5 seconds on his ult, giving that timer, khazix q&#039;s you for 400 damage, leaving your level 6 base hp at round 700-800, then he ults for his second charge making him invis, and allowing his q to cd, and then he lands another 400, YOU DONT EVEN GET A CHANCE TO SCRATCH YOUR BALLS and his all over you, im not talking about a 5/0/0 khazix here, im talking about a 0/0/0 khazix with red buff and 2 long swords. \n\n{{champion:11}} {{summoner:3}} \n\nhonestly what even is that,  at least give everyone else a buff so they dont have to deal with a fizz ult every thirty seconds. \nMe personally i find it funny myself that i main Yi, he may be unskilled or a champ that doesnt require skill, but if you really care about what your community thinks, take this into consideration, today i absolutely triggered, at the fact that, im about to engage fizz, idm that he ulted me, i could have side stepped that, but the fact that, i q him, and he e&#039;s at the same time, thats 2 seconds of my ult gone, and if his got zhonyas, another 2 seconds, leaving 3 seconds. Honestly even a bronze that thinks he deserves diamond will know theirs something wrong with that. \n\n3 seconds left on a yi ult, what if he has guinsoos, by the time he charges it up in a 1v1, his dead. if your going to give 1 assassin a buff, you give all. every assassin has a capability of getting out of a fight without using a summoner spell. except yi... \n\nif this is ignored in the slightest. just shows how much of an imbecile i was to even think riot gives a shit about its players","replies":[]}
