That brings her total movement speed to 442 for **3** seconds.\n\nMaster Yi has 355 base MS, his R at lvl 2 gives him +35%. That beings his total movement speed to 469 for **7** seconds.\n\nThis means that it would be **impossible** for Eve to outrun you unless she had bought a MS item, and you didn't buy one. (and someone with a MS Item generally always outruns someone without one). So this could be your problem. \n\nYou also might have forgotten that Evelynn's W gives her only MS, while Yi's ult not only gives him MS for over twice as long a duration, but also gives him immunity to slows, attack speed, and the ability to extend its duration. \n\nSo if Yi's buff gives him multiple stats, then he should be receiving less movement speed than a buff that only gives 1 stat, otherwise it would be overpowered.\n\n________\n\nHowever I do see your frustration, Eve may not be the most powerful champion, or the most played. But she is one of the most frustrating.\n\nI find that breaking down these problems into their numbers helps understand exactly where the problem is, and so next time you have an idea of how to remedy it ^^\n\nhope this helped.","replies":[]}]}
