Ive tried about 10 times already in 2 days and the same thing happens every single time. I have tried uninstalling, tried opening as admin, tried the repair button and also downloading from different regions. Im on Windows 7. Any help?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-08T02:43:36.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For future reference, bumping does not work on the boards.\n\nThere's one possible fix for this, and that is to refresh your connection as your client stops downloading. Open the client and let it download. When it reaches 0kbps, disconnect your internet, count to ten, and then reconnect it. It should start downloading again after about five minutes.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[{"poster":"Prodigypsy","date":"2015-03-08T06:17:58.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for the tip, trying the connection thing now.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-09T05:46:02.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me know how it turns out, so that we can keep talking if it didn't work.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Prodigypsy","date":"2015-03-07T20:11:06.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]}]}
