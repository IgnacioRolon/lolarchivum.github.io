Anyway i played a game of one for all mode today and no one bought any wards except me who is the only one to upgrade my warding trinket to a {{item:3361}} and bought 1 {{item:2043}} and with only these two items i was able to light up one side of the enemy jungle completely. I just don't get why people don't upgrade their trinket because with that trinket only (i did not buy any other stealth ward the whole game) i was able to light up the enemy jungle for basically the whole game since i upgraded my trinket. Other than that my vision ward actually did not get denied at all and lasted for the whole game. People pls buy wards or at least upgrade your trinkets and stop complaining at supports.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pack a Bag","date":"2015-10-15T12:45:44.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I even got reported by them causing me to get a warning for unsportsmanlike behaviour... \nStupid people, stupid people everywhere.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-15T07:34:56.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahahaha yer wen I hear this im just like ow hell no mother fucker you ever herd of spending 250gold to upgrade a warding trinket no well find out how.
