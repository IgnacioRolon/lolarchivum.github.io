In the future think about their feelings and try to reserve time for League, the games can get pretty long so if you don't have a lot of time or you know you'll need to multi task, play aram or even custom matches. This punishment is harsh but if it was light, everyone would leave their game because \"why not\".","replies":[]}]}
