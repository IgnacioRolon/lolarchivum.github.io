I freeze to make it so he loses trades, but it doesn&#039;t matter if I win a trade because he heals it back.  I thought juggernauts were supposed to be IMMOBILE, so what the fuck is garen?","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-05-25T13:18:12.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Garen is a very safe champion early game but is useless late game. You win by going even with him, meaning he has to be the one to go aggressive on you. When he goes aggressive on you he will take minion damage, which is the perfect time to fight him (depending on the champion you're playing). However, if he gets ahead you have no choice but to play passive and wait for the help of your jungle (unless the garen takes too much minion/turret damage). \n\nIMMOBILE means that they lack mobility. A mobile champion would be someone who can move freely like lucian who can dash a lot, or ezreal who can blink a lot, or kha zix that can jump a lot, or kayn that can walk through walls and dash, or Ahri that has 3 dashes, or Katarina that can blink a lot, or lee sin that can dash freely or to an enemy, etc. Immobile champions cannot pass through terrain or deal with cc very well. If a juggernaut were to chase an ezreal, ezreal can blink over the wall and the juggernaut can no longer touch him unless he is willing to burn flash. If a juggernaut were chasing a lux, the lux can bind the juggernaut and now the juggernaut can no longer touch them. On the other hand if a blitzcrank were to land a hook on ezreal as he is blinking over a wall, the ezreal will be hooked but still blink over the wall and thus break the cc. This is the major difference between mobile and immobile champions.\n\nBasically, you can't fight a juggernaut and be expected to win, but you can CHOOSE not to fight them. You can choose to never let them come near you if you are mobile yourself or have CC. And if you don't let a juggernaut fight you, they're useless. However most top laners are immobile champions or do not have reliable CC, which means juggernauts like garen and darius have an easy time stomping laning phase because you're forced to face them. An easy way to beat them is to play someone that scales into late game or someone that can easily kite them or simply just ignore them. These are champions like fiora, nasus, jax, kennen, gnar, shen, malphite, maokai, gangplank, even aatrox. \n\nTL;DR \n\nDon't let them hit you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-05-21T09:32:11.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Juggernaut means _unstoppable force_, which implies mobility.\n\nGaren is a 'basic' mechanics champ, he can be outplayed fairly easily. You can't poke him down over time (he'll just regen back up), you need to just 'all in' on him with the jungler.
