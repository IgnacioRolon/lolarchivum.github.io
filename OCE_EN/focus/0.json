If they are having sales on RP cards it is likely because they have a lot of overstock that are about to expire and they're trying to get some of what they paid for them back. They would likely be losing money on that deal. As for the games themselves, I believe they have deals sorta like steam does to be able to put them on sale and that on occasion they will put up massive sales to draw attention/presence.\n\nIf you google around a bit, I'm sure you'll find plenty of people asking the same and you will probably get decent answers. That's all I know about it I'm afraid. Good luck!","replies":[]}]}
