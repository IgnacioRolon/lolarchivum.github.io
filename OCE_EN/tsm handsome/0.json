I also found that this happens not only on league, but on any other games. After having the router and modem changed a few months ago, I was then able to play normally without lag. However, today I found that the regular lag spikes came back despite the new router/modem and now they were 4 minutes long and occurred approximately every 30 minutes, which has made it impossible/very annoying to play normally.  \r\nWondering if anyone had similar problems or knows why this is happening?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-07-10T00:24:16.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nSounds like it might be a problem with your ISP and/or router/modem (Have you tried rebooting these [power off/on]).\n\nI would recommend first running through the [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) support article, if nothing there helps could you please do the following:\n\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP.
