I&#039;m liking how when i&#039;m in lobby, it shows up top right too. However, one thing I dislike is how compact you guys have made it. I can&#039;t identify who is in champion select or in game or busy. I have a friend on DO NOT DISTURB and they&#039;re the same colour as the one in CHAMPION SELECT/IN GAME. It&#039;s a little annoying to mouse over every single one of your friend to know what status they are.\r\n\r\nCan&#039;t wait to see more features added into it","replies":[]}
