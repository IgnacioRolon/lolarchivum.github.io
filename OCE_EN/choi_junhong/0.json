I would love to have a fair coach (someone higher ranked or highly knowledgable) to help me out and give me tips along the way. I am open to playing any champion and I listen (really) I would love to communicate via curse or anything eventually^^\r\n\r\nI would love to rank with anyone B/S/G as well since thats all I can rank with haha. I am in Bronze/Silver, I will rank with anyone as long as they don&#039;t rage and are nice/friendly and give good advice instead of putting each other down. lol.... \r\n\r\nAnyways please add me and I will get back to you.\r\nThanks!~","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-02-06T04:04:51.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't argue.\nDon't play hard champs.\nLearn at least 2 champs for each role.\nTry get at least 500wins in norms to learn the fundamentals of team fighting. If you have a higher ranked friend, try and play norms with them to verse higher ranked players without losing LP. \nThis will help you understand how to deal with numerous situations.\n\nStick to easy, OP champs. e.g.{{champion:86}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:104}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-06T12:08:47.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed. A positive attitude can mean the difference between a win and a loss. When I was starting the recommendation was 300 normal wins, I personally think 500 is a better benchmark, but unless you're a real fast learner or have previous MOBA experience, at least 300 wins is a good goal.\n\nIf you can play with higher ranked friends in normals, you learn much faster by adapting to the higher skill level in a hands on environment, so it's a great way to get better quickly (but you'll likely have some frustration early on).","replies":[]}]}]}
