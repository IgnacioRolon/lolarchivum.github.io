It's to prevent things like AFKs making it into game, forgetting to change runes/masteries/summoners and to generally keep the team communicating with one another. If you aren't paying attention and you aren't ready to play then NCS won't let you.\n\nHope I explained why well enough, it shouldn't take too long to get used to locking in. I'd recommend keeping the popup that reminds you when you get in if you are worried about forgetting and if you haven't already gotten rid of it.\n\nWhen it's your turn to pick/ban League will tab you back over to the client over most things too, so if you really want to alt tab, then just make sure you confirm your pick/ban before tabbing back out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Epicshotz","date":"2016-02-27T08:31:37.221+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No they can't , 'couse they don't give two actual shits about their players anyways .","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-25T06:09:38.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wouldn't be as bad if it didn't take so long to register.
