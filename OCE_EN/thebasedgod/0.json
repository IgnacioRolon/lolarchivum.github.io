This term is closely associated with steam and some consider the terms equivalent, but 'steam' typically carries more anger and intensity.[1]\n\nPlacing an opponent on tilt or dealing with being on tilt oneself is an important aspect of poker. It is a relatively frequent occurrence due to frustration, animosity against other players, or simply bad luck.
