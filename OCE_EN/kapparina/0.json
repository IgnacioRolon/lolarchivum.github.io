Riot need to nerf her so she can be played as a **SUPPORT** not an **AP FIGHTER/ASSASSIN** champion. Please know that certain champs have certain roles and come with their own playstyles, playing {{champion:37}} Sona AP because, for example, you didn't want support and you joined late, is just stupid. Supports are needed to level the playing field and assist teammates. **ASSIST TEAMMATES**. Not go and **substitute your team's ADC** and make them support **YOU**. **Want to play a more versatile support champ? WAIT FOR *BARD* AND PLAY HIM.**","replies":[{"poster":"Excited","date":"2015-03-08T09:28:01.223+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"she can be played mid or support, each have their advantages and disadvantages.\n\nmy question for you is: (because those vote selections are just screaming closed minded)\n\ndo you want to know how to beat this champion? or you just want her nerfed into the ground?","replies":[]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-03-08T11:28:12.785+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"everyone thinking he got beat by a sona mid...he is saying sona supports building full AP because they didnt get to go mid lane and wanted to go an AP champ...\n\nits funny cos so many AP champs go really well as supports, annie zyra velkoz and tons of others. but sona actually GAINS tons of utility from AP. since it increases her heal, her shield, her move speed boost, how much damage she gives her allies with Q.\nso high AP is the ONLY way to play sona. especially in this meta where she gets dumpstered by most other supports (nami is sona 2.0)\n\nmikaels is a good item, but only if you are mechanically able to use the active effectively and efficiently....so 90% of players aint gunna use it right, so a lichbane is going to help the team more than a fail mikaels. (or a morellonomicon if you want a direct item comparison)\nlocket is fine, but banner is better, but then rabbadons is even better on sona.....\n\nat the end of it....AP items outscale support items for sona. if banner had more AP it might be picked up more. tanky items are effectively useless on sona since she is always a squishball. AP means she gets more burst damage AND burst heals/shields and AP scales really well with her move speed boost too.","replies":[{"poster":"Excited","date":"2015-03-08T12:12:54.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great points, also would like to add a few points of info\n\n\n* Sona has 2 target enemy player debuffs which can effect x1 target only and 1 AOE CC component in her kit,  this means pre 6 she is insanely easy to pick and all-in. Yes it takes full commitment, but shes still very squishy. You'll either kill her or get her flash or BOTH SUMMS!! either way its a win.. \n\n* Her W costs **ALOT** more then her Q, think about this for second, it costs more to recover, then it does to poke.. i think you know where i'm going with this!\n\n* Post 6 again easy for a pick if she is off warding alone.. this means if you want to keep her behind, you need to have a better vision game then her.\nUPGRADE YOUR TRINKET! REGARDLESS OF ROLE!!!- IE: if your mid and roaming buy the yellow trinket - its a 60 second CD and the ward lasts 3 mins... its great for dynamic warding and spotting weak players for picks. IT LITERALLY PAYS FOR ITSELF IN x1 KILL! OR it pays for it self after x4 wards dropped.\n\n\nthere is more, but i'm not going to give all the answers. its upto you to learn and improve\n\nGoodluck\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2015-03-08T11:02:29.532+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like someone got destroyed by a Sona mid and is henceforth complaining here about how 'op' she is.\nWell good thing for you she has been getting nerfed continuously for a while now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-03-08T10:36:33.328+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ohhhh someone just got beat by {{champion:37}} mid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BladeSensual","date":"2015-03-09T22:28:47.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i hear someone who got rekt by a support","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-03-09T02:52:13.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like AP Soraka better, build an early mejais and watch everything around you not die.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-03-08T23:37:39.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lich bane is a good game\nEDIT:YOULOSTTOSONAGG","replies":[]}]}
