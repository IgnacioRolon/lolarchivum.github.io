Rarely. There is already a mechanic that allows to you manually mute players 1 at a time but doing this at the start of every single match is time consuming and can be managed better.\n\nThe current chat system is at best a placeholder for what is sorely needed at any rate in game VOIP, basically every online game has it these days so there really is no excuse to not have it in what is purportedly the most played game on Earth.\nIf a VOIP system is implemented a number of toxic comments will cease as (in my experience and opinion) some of the most \"mouthy\" are young children (who legally should not even be playing) and these tend to not use mics for abuse as the fear ridicule. \n\nThere really should just be an option in settings to turn off chat (as with the all chat button) OCE has no tribunal (and probably never will) so that means 99% of calls are: \n\n\"you stupid ****** X\" \n\"why did you feed X\"\n\"its all X&#039;s fault\"\n\nad infinitum.\n\nIt really is a pity that a minority will be adversely effected but until such time as there is a punishment for toxicity and negative behavior it wont stop and global mute is the best solution for a small component of toxicity on OCE.\n\nLong story short, Put in a button to turn chat off as a temp fix for _some_ toxic behavior pending the mythical tribunal&#039;s appearance.\n\n\"~~Mos Eisley spaceport~~ OCE: You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.

But I won't deny it completely. If some does an official study into it and gets concrete, unbias proof then I might change my mind.\n\n>I am Australian it is impossible for me to be racist towards my own race.. see \"blacks\" using N word.\n\nThat might hold merit (albeit not much at all, you can't really use any excuse to be offensive toward anyone and justify it), but not everyone knows you're Australian straight off the bat. It's just being courteous. Try and with-hold such comments to your real-life friends.\n\n>Prove it firstly, secondly you build your counter claim on statistics then claim statistics are no help.. shot yourself in the foot there.\n\nI was quoting. Sorry for not posting the source immediately, I have no excuse for that. http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/player-behavior-design-values-punishment (it's in the last section). My point was that we can pull statistics out of thin-air wherever, but in reality they don't really prove anything. I do not believe that only 2% of games have toxicity in them, and I never said that I did.\n\n>This is a technical issue, the game lacks a global mute button and it is needed.. you don't say it (while picking at other parts) so the assumption is you also endorse the global mute button (or the ability to turn off chat)\n\nAll implementations made by Riot into the game have ramifications on the behaviour of the players in said game. If, for example, there was a button which allowed people to completely remove all communication from others in League so that it turns into a pseudo-single-player experience, then that's effectively Riot encouraging people not to communicate.\n\nAlso there is a \"Reply\" button.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-24T07:32:03.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">tend to not use mics for abuse as the fear ridicule.\n\nHow's voice-chat any different to text-chat in regards to this? It's not like someone's not going to abuse someone else if they were to just because they have to use their mouth instead of their hands. If anything, using their hands requires more effort, allowing them more time to think about exactly what they're doing a maybe reconsider it.\n\nAbout toxicity in general, you say that 99% of calls are 'toxic', but I also read somewhere else that only less than 2% of games actually have toxic players in them. Basically, statistics just don't help ever.\n\n>Australians are much much more toxic..\n\nwow racism much?\n\n>\"My Internet is bad/ I have to go\"\n\nWait so this is a list of excuses players use to be toxic?

OCE has less players, so it seems more toxic.\n\nAnyone who has played a game on US servers then changed to AUS servers can testify that Australians are much much more toxic..\n\n- Wrong on so many levels, lets take an oversimplified example;\n\nOCE has 1000 players with 1 in 100 toxic\n\nNA has 10,000 players also with 1:100 toxic\n\nyou are just as likely statistically speaking to get toxic player(s) in your game, this is especially true as more games are played by more people (flip a coin 3 times 1 may be heads (toxic player), do it 1,000,000 times and you will get 50/50) if a large body of the community (proportionally to other servers) is crying out over toxic behavior there must be some credence to these claims.\n\n2.) There is no Tribunal\n\nwhile strictly true this is the fault or RIOT for not implementing some stop-gap (be it the current system or attaching us to another servers system)\nRIOT claimed 12,000,000 active accounts in 2012, if each of these spent just $10 a year on RP (yes some wont spend any, but some will spend 10x as much) revenue from RP alone would be $120,000,000, not putting some back into the game is stingy and suicidal.\n\n3.) \"Its only Normals\"\n\nThis is a common call across all severs (I feel) it is more common in OCE (due to higher toxic player count?) While this may be true for some people \"Normals\" are some peoples Ranked games.. and lets face it how mad (and then toxic) would you be if you had a \"scrub\" in your Prelim game because he is trying to avoid this excuse?\n\n4.) \"My Internet is bad/ I have to go\"\n\nSimple, if you net is poor, DON'T PLAY. If you are unaware of the quality of your connection DON'T PLAY. Ignorance is no excuse.\nIf you are getting leavebuster bans because of this you need to discuss QoS with your ISP, if there is nothing that can be done about it LoL isn't the game for you. (Also DO NOT use WIFI.. this is a leading cause of poor performance)","replies":[]}]}
