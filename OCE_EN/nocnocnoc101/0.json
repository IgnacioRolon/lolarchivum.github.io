A lot of my friends hopped right into ranked as soon as they hit 30, and are now just complaining about how they don't deserve to be in B5 ... like come on guys, just play some more. I think it is also a really good way to stop trolls and smurfs from flooding games .. there are still a few but if it was a shorter time to get to 30 there would be way more I am sure. So I doubt they will change it much. Just have fun learning the game and don't be too eager to get into ranked, its not that much fun until you start winning a lot of the games. But when you do, It is better than normals I think, much more competitive and exciting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Z3npachi","date":"2016-02-21T07:40:04.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I don't agree about the 300 game req and with the new dynamic que even less game experience is required to be \"competent\" for ranked, but it does help to have some experience before ranked unlocks. I'd suggest purchasing an XP booster if you really wish to fast track to 30, use the free RP that is gifted to your account and spam out bulk games on a weekend sometime.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-21T06:47:29.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That time exists so that those without the experience don't enter ranked until their skills are more suitable to do so. In fact it is a common suggestion that you should have at least 300 normal wins before entering ranked. Especially in the lower tiers, you need to have role and champion diversity and be able to play as a part of teams/comps that will change every game.\n\nYou have to be able to play at least two roles competently, and ideally at least three champions in each role. It's also fairly necessary to have an understanding of all the items and their interactions, and all champions' abilities as well as a basic understanding of counters and how to build for or against a team.\n\nYou can't really learn all the BASICS of the game in 1-30 (unless perhaps you have played a lot of some other MOBA), hence the recommended 300 wins. That is why those levels exist.\n\nIf you are winning 60% of your games then you will start getting matched against better and better people until that number is around 50%, so you'll see an increase in difficulty fairly soon.","replies":[]}]}
