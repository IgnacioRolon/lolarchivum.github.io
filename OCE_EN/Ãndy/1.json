You are sitting on the first of four punishment tiers, it is in essence to pull you up and say \"hey, this can't continue\".\n\n>I only said a few swear words but that was towards no one and just the game.\n\nIf you want community feedback on a punishment, post your reform card (chat logs). No-one can tell you why you were punished if they don't know what you were punished for.\n\n>I did arugue with my mid but only after he started it.\n\nIt doesn't matter who started it, you are being judged on your behaviour. Defending yourself and retaliating (firing back) are not the same, one is (while not necessarily advisable) fine, the other is not and can result in punishment.\n\n>None of it was bad\n\nJust because that's how you feel, doesn't mean everyone else agrees with you. I can hardly comment to the specifics of your punishment, but there are people who believe *no* chat should be punishable. Whether or not you necessarily agree with where the lines are set, you have agreed to abide by them in order to play the game.\n\n>i am wondering if riot employees read the reports or just a system thing\n\nFor the most part reports are handled by the IFS (Instant Feedback System) which is an automated learning system. It is not however in any way simple, nor is it based on keywords or number of reports (though these are factors that *can* contribute). \n\nIt is a machine learning system that uses validated reports to understand the behaviours that the community wants gone. [It has a false positive rate of <0.01% of penalties](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/oEpXvoXZ-i-typed-these-6-sentences-to-a-raging-adc-and-i-got-banned-for-2-weeks-for-verbal-abuse-riot?comment=00140000000000000001), and is also subject to manual oversight. You can also appeal punishments through [player support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), which guarantees it will be looked over by a person.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YukiHikado","date":"2018-12-31T05:38:26.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Swearing in general is a offence XD","replies":[{"poster":"hokyabox","date":"2018-12-31T08:45:15.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no it is not, right...you can filter bad swear words - like - nupoonu,  Kyrgyzstan and yastisum","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-12-31T03:11:33.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Post Logs, so we can see if you deserved it","replies":[]}]}
