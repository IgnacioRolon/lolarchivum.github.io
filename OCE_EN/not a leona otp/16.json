Must have Skype/Discord/TS3 (can provide all) and a Working Microphone. Looking for non-toxic players (players who flame will immediately be deleted) who are serious and dedicated to the game but however can still cultivate a fun, banter-filled atmosphere for us to climb together while still being a friendly duo :) We all make mistakes (we are gold scrubs) and the expectation is that we both can learn from, accept and even make fun of each other&#039;s mistakes.\r\n\r\nAny players interested can add me directly IGN: Support Leona, no point putting your name in the comments as I&#039;ll probably just add you anyways and it&#039;ll save us time :)","replies":[]}
