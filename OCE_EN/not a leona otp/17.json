The first &quot;The Knights&quot; roster was a strong and the longest lasting roster, but failed due to conflicts between players and in-team, deep rooted problems that would best be fixed by disbandment. The second roster was an extremely dedicated and committed roster, coming 2nd Place in a tournament just a few weeks into development. However, staff conflicts and loss of dedication from the management staff forced a secondary disbandment from an otherwise strong and extremely capable roster. The Knights however are looking to give it a go into the 2016 OOL Split 2, and have decided to attempt to form a third roster for the upcoming split. \r\n\r\nWho are The Knights?\r\n\r\nThe Knights e-Sports again is a team that has achieved an extremely large amount in the League Of Legends scene. It is ran by me, the manager, who has had experience coaching high ranked players and managing multiple teams aside from The Knights. Again, previously, other teams have had some complications in running, but we believe we can finally make a difference coming into this third team.
