Teaching and coaching has always been one of my passions, along with League Of Legends, so I thought, why not combine both to fulfil my dream?\n\nFirst of all, I am not looking for any OCS or OPL team (not like you&#039;d want me anyways). If you&#039;re looking for a god coach who can put you guys into the OCS/OPL, then like, you&#039;re not getting it with me. I&#039;m just looking for a semi-serious team with a proper roster and maybe a training schedule to play.\n\nNow, on my experience as a coach and player.  I am the former Support of The Knights e-Sports (now disbanded), a semi-pro team which has achieved the following:\n\n6th in CyberGamer Open ladder\n4th in Vertex Gaming Tournament\n1st in OneVOneNZ tournament (Yes, I do have Triumphant Ryze) \n\nI am a coach on lol-coaching, and I have 5/5 reviews by three players (going up quickly0 who I absolutely adore teaching. Teaching is my passion, like I said!\n\nhttp://www.lol-coaching.com/coach.php?id=46768\n\nWhat can I do for you as a coach?\n\nAs an experienced support and manager of a team, I know exactly how coaching goes in teams. A coach should:\n\n- Be punctual\n- Have a passion for coaching\n- Have a high understanding of the League Pro Scene \n- Have high game knowledge\n- Have the ability to understand the weaknesses and strengths of a team\n- Be able to have the ability to improve with drills\n\nAs a player of a semi-pro team and a passionate coach, I believe I have all the qualities it takes to be a good coach.\n\nWhat team am I looking for?\n\nI am looking for a semi-serious team which has a stable roster and a schedule of training so I know what times to attend. I am not willing to join a team with troll Bronzes - I am looking for a serious team with true ambitions but just need that coach in order to really improve.\n\nWhat am I looking for as a coach?\n\nAs a coach, I am only asking that the players and managers, etc give me respect and listen to what I have to say. I am not looking to be paid - I am willing to do this for absolutely free - no cost. I just enjoy coaching  and am looking for that opportunity to start.\n\nIf you are interested in having me, feel free to post a comment with a bit about your team. I would like to know your roster, your ambition as a team and why you want me to coach you guys. I would like a bit of a blurb on your team as well, just some extra information. Additionally, you can add me on league at TKNS Diamond. \n\nI look forward to coaching your team!\n\nEDIT: Since this post, I have now found a team. However, still feel free to add me if you wanted a session or anything of the sort - always happy to help.","replies":[{"poster":"ASR Norm","date":"2016-01-25T07:49:13.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Diamond, I can't add you on the league of legends client but I would like to be able to message you privately if that is possible.
