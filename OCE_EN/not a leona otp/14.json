Experienced Support!","subforum":"Team Recruitment","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys, before I get started, my League IGN is: AnonymousDiamond. \r\n\r\nMy rank is Silver IV, and I am currently maining the support role playng:\r\n\r\n- Leona\r\n- Thresh\r\n- Alistar\r\n- Morgana (Learning)\r\n- Janna (Learning)\r\n\r\nHey guys! I am an experienced support (I really only play support) looking to get into a serious ranked team, actually serious: (Training, drills, proper team chats and plays). I am looking to get into a team with serious and experienced players, preferably all Silver+. \r\n\r\nAfter watching the opL live from Luna Park, I have been inspired to try to get into higher tier gaming. I was looking to get into a serious team to try out for the 2016 Oceanic League, and this means I am looking for a team who actually also wants to get there with me. This means that I want a team who is dedicated, not to the point of having no life, but maybe spending a bit of time on the weekends and such to play and practise. \r\n\r\nI am looking for a team who can Skype regularly, and not rage in defeat and can stay calm and encourage their players. Additionally, I am looking for pro picks - as in I want to play with people who can play with proper champions and are experienced in their role - but also flexible. \r\n\r\nI really hope I can find a team to suit my purpose!\r\n\r\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Mattsherona","date":"2015-08-12T08:29:57.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im down, mattsherona, jg main, d5","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-08-10T15:20:12.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Good luck mate!\n{{champion:115}}","replies":[]}]}
