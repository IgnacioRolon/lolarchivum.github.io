TKNS for 2017 OCS!\n\nHello! After a several month hiatus of The Knights e-Sports (TKNS), a previously established team with a solid roster and several high-profile achievements, is looking to recruit a brand new roster to compete in the First OOL split, and hopefully, with an ever improving roster, we can hopefully look to make it into the Oceanic Challenger Series of the future.\n\nThe Knights are known and established in the Oceanic Competitive Scene, with the following achievements:\n\n1st in OneVOneNZ Tournament (2015)\n1st in AusStarSYD Tournament (2015)\n1st in Handon Gaming Tournament (2015)\n4th in Vertex Gaming Tournament (2015)\n3rd in the CyberGamer Open Ladder (2015)\n\nSo now, onto the team blurb.\n\nWhat can The Knights do for you? The Knights will:\n\nPay for all tournament fees, as seen fit.\nPay for a TeamSpeak Server (Will come up, firstly using Skype as a VOIP)\nProvide all coaching and analyst sessions to ensure constant team improvement\nProvide an extremely friendly but competitive environment for a strong team\nSet up scrimmages against high level teams, and depending on skill, OCS and OPL teams (Yes, I do have the contacts for this, but I&#039;ll get blatantly rejected if this team does not progress well)\nWhat do I expect from my players, for recruiting and future play?\n\nFriendly, non-argumentative atmosphere (Let&#039;s face it, you&#039;ll make the same mistakes as them eventually)\nA Solo Queue Rank of higher than Platinum, may take consideration to Gold Players (But improvement must be made if hopes of the Challenger Series are to be made, so guys climb to Diamond 3.\nWillingness to accept constructive criticism and contribute actively to the team by keeping active.\nAttend all training sessions.\nNote: I&#039;ve been in multiple teams, either as the establisher or simply a part of it during its establishment. I know that there will be players who just simply join, and be inactive and just ignore any messages sent forward their way. That&#039;s given, I&#039;ve had experience in this scene before. If you think you can just turn up and ditch all the training sessions, and be inactive, your darn ass is gonna be kicked out, Challenger or not. Seriously! I&#039;m looking for a friendly team who can play together well, regardless of solo queue rank!\n\nSo, most roles are open, which are:\n\nTop: Filled\nJG: FIlled\nMid: Filled\nADC: Filled\nSupport: Filled\nSub 1: Filled\nSub 2: OPEN ONLY\nTeam&#039;s Janitor: Jimuskin\n\nNow, it&#039;s your turn to trial! Write a block of text in the comments below, with all of these: (See, I was going to make a Google Forms but then I only had an ADC and Mid one, so nope).\n\nName:\nAge:\nSolo Queue Rank:\nSummoner ID:\nRole(s):\nPool in each role:\nAvailability:\nWhat distinguishes this team from others that makes you want to join?:\nPrevious Team Experience:\n\nAlternatively, but not suggestedly (because I need an application, and I know that isn&#039;t a real word), add Support Leona on League Of Legends!\n\nOr do both, that&#039;s something that&#039;s suggested :)\n\nGood luck, and may The Knights 2.0 have an awesome season!\n\nhttp://imgur.com/8Tcaf4z","replies":[{"poster":"GrV Syzche","date":"2016-04-22T04:28:00.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Name:Tega\nAge:15\nSolo Queue Rank:Plat2 (diamond 2 last year\nSummoner ID:Hyper Imprint\nRole(s):Jungle\nPool in each role{{champion:28}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:203}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:11}} \nMessage me in game and we talk\nIm happy to be a sub\nI have gotten tips from LGC Carbon","replies":[]},{"poster":"playsuit","date":"2016-02-25T09:58:31.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll join brah, I'm the SKT Marin of Bronze IV.","replies":[{"poster":"Not A Leona OTP","date":"2016-02-25T10:49:11.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yes, of course.
