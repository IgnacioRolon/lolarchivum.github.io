I had then ran into a issue with the card being not activated. I sent Riot a ticket asking for assistance and they  gave me a suggestion to go back to Coles and ask them to help me with issue. I did what was suggested and got no help from Coles.   I&#039;m  just curious if I will get my $25 worth of RP. I have a feeling that I won&#039;t but if anyone runs into this issue I will be sure to write the  final solution that riot has given me. Got my $25 worth of RP or They did nothing.\n\n\nBtw I had given photographic proof of me purchasing the card with receipt and purchase history. They even checked the system and saw that the card was inactivated. Could it be Coles or Riot&#039;s fault","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-08-26T08:14:31.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It shouldn't matter who's to blame for the faulty card, the matter of fact is you brought the card from Coles, not Riot Games. So Coles is responsible for the quality of the product they sold.\n\nI'm not sure what Coles told you when you went back, but assuming you kept the receipt, you should be eligible for a full refund under [Australian Consumer Law](https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/consumer-rights-guarantees/repair-replace-refund). If I was you I'd head back to Coles and demand a full refund. \n\nIf possible, it might be a good idea to bring a laptop with League installed and show them the product isn't working.\n\nBest of luck man :D","replies":[{"poster":"Yuro","date":"2017-08-26T08:20:37.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info :)\n\nthey had told me that Riot was a third party for them that they do not gain any money from the cards being purchased. Unless i had a written response from Riot they could not assist me further. Unless the Australian Consumer Law over takes that? Im not really sure how these law agreements and stuff works. Im just hoping that Riot could assist me with this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-08-26T09:25:51.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so, I've looked into the issue a bit further, and I recommend you head back to Coles and do the following:\n\n+ Specifically tell Coles that THEY need to activate the card again.\n  \n According to [Riot](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201753224-Prepaid-RP-Cards-NA-OCE-#why) it's the _\"sole responsibility of the merchant\"_ to activate the cards. You need to make this clear to Coles, and emphasise that Riot cannot do it.\n\n\n+ If that doesn't work, you might want to bring up that according to Australian Consumer Law they must give a refund.\n\n _\"A supplier of goods cannot refuse to help a consumer by sending them to the manufacturer or importer.\"_ - [Source](http://consumerlaw-staging.tspace.gov.au/files/2016/05/0553FT_ACL-guides_Guarantees_web.pdf)\n\n  Not a legal pro, but it definitely sounds like Coles is sending you to the _\"manufacturer or importer\"_. It's a complete lie that they're not receiving some kind of money for selling cards, no major store would sell goods at $0 profit.\n\nIf all of that doesn't work they you might have to head back to Riot Support and let them know what happened. \n\nGood luck man :D","replies":[{"poster":"Yuro","date":"2017-08-26T10:30:41.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, thank you so much. I followed your advice and it worked for me. They changed the card and gave me a new one and it worked.\n\ni went to coles not long ago and gave them all the evidence i had. The Prepaid card, receipt and the email i got from riot. I was worried about telling them about the Australian law because my english isnt very good i didnt know how to be formal with them when i talked about it since i do not know much about the law as well. But i didnt have to luckily. \n\nBut i would like to thank you so much for the help and assistance you have given me, i appreciate the time and effort you have given to help assist my issues. You are a true hero and i wish the best for you.\n\nThank you \n\nYuroAkiyama","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-08-26T22:39:39.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries man.
