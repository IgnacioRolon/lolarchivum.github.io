I certainly don't mean to be, but unfortunately written words don't convey intent or emotion.\n\nI'll try to keep my reply concise.\n\n___________________________________________\n\nWe are the alpha testers. The chosen, privileged players to test the new client. Riot are not giving us access only as a reward, but as guinea pigs.\n\nWe are not the only lot of testers for the alpha client, there are multiple tiers. Not only this, but Riot are welcoming more and more players into the client as it progresses.\n\nRiot not only accept that we share images, videos, etc of the alpha client and its development with the wider community, they openly recommend it.\n\nIf we were forced to used the alpha client, rendering Twisted Treeline, Ranked matches and the Rotating game modes inaccessible to us, I would agree we should get some recompense. This isn't the case as we are allowed to switch to, and from, Legacy Client whenever we want.\n\nYes Riot wants us to report bugs, glitches and issues with the client. We agreed to when we first applied and then downloaded client from the link provided to us. Riot are hoping we do what is best for the community, which I'm sure most if not all of us are doing. \n\nThis is a responsibility. Not one that we have gained from the alpha client, but one we have gained from playing LoL. Our responsibility as players is to report bugs where ever we see them, in the alpha client, the legacy client and the game itself.\n\nLastly, Riot owe us nothing. In most cases, we owe Riot for making all of this possible and continuing to serve us daily. Honestly at this point I'd expected Riot to tell a lot of its playerbase to politely go copulate themselves, just from the abuse, rudeness and straight up bullpoop they get dealt. It may be their jobs, but they don't have to put up with the indecency they receive from some people. (I'm not saying or implying that you are one of these people, I'm talking in general) \n\n_____________________________________\n\nTL;DR A skin or summoner icon would be cool, but don't expect one. Riot owe us nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"DarthJohn101","date":"2016-06-11T11:54:01.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im not saying that need to do it but just something to show that we helped. even if it only a small thing that only we can see.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RebirthKnight","date":"2016-06-10T08:44:11.919+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool idea, but I think a skin is way too much to ask for.
