I logged into my emails to see that the reason for the ban was botting. I never used bots. \n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \nLooking on google there looks to be lots of people that were banned for this 4-5 months ago. Is logging a support ticket via support@riotgames.com best way to get this resolved?\n\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-07-29T03:52:03.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nI know im a bit late with a reply here, however your best bet at contesting your ban would be to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) to Player Support directly, yes.","replies":[]}]}
