I tried to login today to find myself permanently banned, I checked my emails and account match history, I find I was banned for &quot;malicious 3rd party programs or modifications to the League of Legends client&quot;.\r\n\r\nWhen I look at my match history, I find that some guy has essentially stolen my league account for a joyride to go script with his pre-made buddies till he got the account permanently banned. I see an email for a password change request on the 22nd followed by his games and a permanent ban on the 24th.\r\n\r\nRequest:\r\nhttps://puu.sh/AsEpp/a46c3b1559.png\r\n\r\nNotifications:\r\nhttps://puu.sh/AsLas/5d613ddaa7.png\r\n\r\nLast game I played was twisted fate, you see him premade with his friends in the last 3 games:\r\nhttps://puu.sh/AsDDd/8884d79b13.png\r\n\r\nI contacted riot support when I found out about this, but they essentially responded saying that context doesn&#039;t matter, It doesn&#039;t matter if the account was stolen without consent or without being shared, if someone used 3rd party programs on that account it is permanently banned with zero tolerance. \r\n\r\nSpecifically their response was: &quot;Keep in mind that account sharing of any kind is also against the Terms of Use. You are responsible for all activity on your account, so be sure to keep your account information to yourself.&quot;\r\n\r\nPersonally I feel this is a little sad, unfair, and a pretty anti-climatic way to end the literal years of my life that I have spent with this game and its community. In this case despite keeping account information to myself, not sharing the account, I had no control over what happened and I have to lose it all. The case should be fairly obvious based on logs, IP or other information that I had my account stolen, but no one seems to be able to look into it.","replies":[{"poster":"Master Roshi","date":"2018-05-25T17:29:44.091+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update: I got another response from support, but even after verifying the fact that the account was stolen they insist that nothing can be done, and that I am responsible for everything regardless of the fact that there was nothing I could do about the leak.\n\nResponse below:\nhttps://puu.sh/AsOq8/3312098ee5.png\n\nEssentially, its all my fault that I was not able to catch them and recover my account immediately before they could do anything and \"there is nothing that can be done.\" Which is partially true, as If I was on the top of my game paying complete attention at best I could have caught them within 1 day instead of 2, but I did respond to them Immediately as soon as I suspected and noticed like they asked, so they could hopefully help me.","replies":[]}]}
