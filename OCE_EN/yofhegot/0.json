So Ill do it now. Today, I decided to update my LoL to the new update 5.10 (I think). It updated successfully. Then I clicked launch but nothing happened, the sound effect executed and everything but nothing happened so I just assumed it was lag and waited it out, The EULA popped up after a while, but after clicking accept it still refused to bring me to the login screen. I have googled for god knows how many hours on how to fix it, I&#039;ve tried deleting my projects folder. Anyone have any other solutions? (I&#039;d like to leave reinstalling as the last resort)\r\nThanks in advance","replies":[{"poster":"YoFhegot","date":"2015-05-31T00:19:54.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[SOLVED] \nSo I tried reinstalling LoL -nope didnt work\nReinstalling all the .net frameworks - nope\nDoing some crazy shit with cmd and regedit - nope\nReinstalling my OS -nope\nThen finally after deleting a bunch more programs and further hours of googling I came across a GENIUS idea.
