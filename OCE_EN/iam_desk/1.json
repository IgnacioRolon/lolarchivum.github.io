Still learning the finer points of the game (which is hard in this division), but have good awareness and can play my mains proficiently. Can also admit when I&#039;m wrong and learn from mistakes. Sick of being stuck with either advanced players who abuse everyone, or people who have no clue at all.\n\nHave played many other games competitively, and just want to get better while playing harder teams, and have fun. Unfortunately the rl friends I have that play, are gold/plat and don't really wanna tank down in bronze.\n\nDon&#039;t rage, very chill\n\nPeace","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2015-08-15T11:15:53.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play {{champion:122}} top and {{champion:107}} jungle add me if your interested","replies":[]},{"poster":"og1764","date":"2015-08-12T02:31:42.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup.
