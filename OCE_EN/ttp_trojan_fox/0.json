I've spent a bunch of time trying to find OCE content creators giving away the chroma, and so far I've found **one** that gave some away on a stream during work hours. Riot, why are you making it hard to give you my money? I'll pay double RP for the chroma, heck, make it cost a gemstone if you have to, but exclusivity locked behind luck and timing is really annoying. I'd love to support sales by purchasing this chroma, but it's likely I'm going to end up supporting a scalper that overprices on eBay (if there are even enough chromas given out on OCE). I understand this is probably ranting and shouting into the abyss, but ideally we could get some insight into the best way to get this chroma on OCE. Would it be better to ask on the NA forums?\r\n\r\n{{champion:32}}RITO PLS{{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-10-22T08:46:01.464+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"a guy I watch got accepted and gives them away.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dH9xY43SbEU","replies":[{"poster":"TTP Trojan Fox","date":"2018-10-25T10:33:30.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!

Exclusivity gets them money, and they don't care who misses out on a border or chroma or entire skin, just as long as _enough_ people buy it to be worth their time.\n\nI work a full time job.  \nThese last few weeks I have used nearly every available moment I have had playing league to get enough tokens for Prestige Kai'sa. I haven't even broken 1000 yet, and we are already half way through. Short of not eating/sleeping, or skipping work _(which is not an option in Japan)_, I physically can not earn enough tokens to get the skin. Even if I did manage to scrape enough tokens together, I would still miss out on Kalista's border and chroma who has been ye'old faithful to me for years, just so I can get a limited skin.\n\nImagine how Kai'sa mains must feel!\nBut even then, at least you can work towards it!\n\nImagine how Sivir mains must have felt when Neo-Pax sivir went on sale for gemstones just for a short amount of time. Getting a gemstone is just luck. You cant make a limited time only skin available though luck! Thats just immoral.\n\nSivir mains had 3 options:\n\n1. Throw literally hundreds of dollars into hextech crafting, for the luck prevention to kick in and give you 10 gemstones.\n2. Take days off work. Buy a plane ticket to a different country, purchase PAX tickets, pay for accommodation/food/travel etc. and pray that Riot hasn't run out of PAX code giveaways.\n3. Happen to live in the city where PAX was held.\n\nThose are pretty bleak options for 95% of people.\n\n_______________\n\n#In an ideal world\n\nIf it had it my way, every skin in the game would be available to any player at any time, _(providing they jump through the right hoops to get it)_.\n\nVictorious skins would be given to anyone who was gold that year, AND once players get to gold, the previous victorious skins would be available for purchase either in the shop or for gemtones. _(so Morgana etc. mains who get gold this year, don't have to go the rest of their lives with incomplete collections, just because they got gold a year or so late.)_\n\n'Exclusive' chromas and skins would be given/bought during their respective events, but after that they would still be available in some way through hextech crafting.\n\n'Limited' skins like Black Alistar and UFO Corki would make a comeback in some way.\nQuite honestly I don't give a f*ck about the feelings of the people who already have it.\nIts just plain cruel to deny 99.99999% of Alistar players one of his best skins, just to keep a couple of pre-order players feeling good about themselves _(most of whom stopped playing league years ago!)_.\n\nAt the very least, limited skins should be available through RNG re-rolls in hextech crafting.\nAt least then, theres a hope, and who knows, Riot may even make a bit of money out of it too.\n\n_______________\n\n#TL;DR: \nIf you want a skin/chroma/border etc. There should be a way for you to get it. No question.\nPlayers shouldn't be restricted from completing collections for their mains because of things that are out of their control.\n_I.e. Not playing league at the time, or being on holiday that weekend, or getting gold in the wrong year, having a mac when league went on pre-order, etc._\n\nand above all: **NO LUCK-BASED GIVEAWAYS!**\n\n_**PS.** Good luck in getting your chroma bro! A collection like yours being incomplete would just be sad :(_","replies":[{"poster":"TTP Trojan Fox","date":"2018-10-18T07:11:02.852+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is pretty much everything I wanted to say and even more, except way more thought out and articulated.

We just do not know how yet or how long it will take if they do make it available later. The most we can do at the moment is state our concern so they do follow through on making another way to obtain it in the future (Hopefully they do not add another layer of exclusivity to it like a border if they do though as that would suck).","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-10-17T13:09:22.900+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the least they could do would be advertise where to get them; if they really are \"partners\" with these Youtubers/Streamers, a little advertising for them isn't going to hurt.","replies":[]},{"poster":"J3nSbY","date":"2018-11-02T17:16:01.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel bad for getting this skin and activate it on my account now :( didnt even think it was that rare :(","replies":[]}]}
