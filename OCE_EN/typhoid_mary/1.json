Riot's posts themselves spout number like players are more reformed and less and less people are banned every year but the game still feels the same. At least in OCE anyways. When you get truly toxic people ie. clear intent feeding or verbal abuse etc. nothing happens. Maybe it does, maybe they get a warning but you are not informed, and so its almost like people get away with intentional feeding and abuse with zero consequences. It feels like you have to get all 9 players to report one person to see action which is quite difficult to do. \r\n\r\nYou can say well he probably isn't feeding he is just bad, no I am talking about people running it down mid or doing that whole \"I'm not feeding I am trying\" in all chat but really they are clearly running it down mid 2 or 3 times and then stop or such behavior. I have seen in 2019 time and time again this happening and there is no difference between now and 2013 when the community was the most toxic part of the game. The evidence is in the chat logs of games, countless times people flout toxicity and then say \"I won't get banned lol\" or other similar phrases. It is almost like people know there are certain thresholds and then dance on the line like its 1999. \r\n\r\nRegardless of certain in game situations it is quite clear the ban system is broken.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nOne of many frustrated players in the OCE region.","replies":[{"poster":"Quinnova","date":"2020-01-02T04:42:34.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man, I just got a 14 day suspension for typing this:\nGame 1\nIn-Game\nQuinnova: didnt know if u had that lol\nQuinnova: mb\nQuinnova: what for\nQuinnova: o lmao\nQuinnova: teemo shroom\nQuinnova: lmao\nQuinnova: goddamn teeto\nQuinnova: lol\nQuinnova: aram?\nQuinnova: yep lamo\nQuinnova: lmao\nQuinnova: flash a bit earlier?\nQuinnova: lmao\nQuinnova: FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK\nQuinnova: get fucked\nQuinnova: %%%\nQuinnova: irelia mate\nQuinnova: counterganks arent workin out so well\nQuinnova: i dont have a %%%\nQuinnova: o\nQuinnova: pyke imagine if you did that a bit earlier\nQuinnova: yknow\nQuinnova: when i was there\nQuinnova: n stuff\nQuinnova: my shit?\nQuinnova: i earnt that kill\nQuinnova: mages are balanced\nQuinnova: lol\nQuinnova: its tru\nQuinnova: whote\nQuinnova: no hom\nQuinnova: lol\nQuinnova: gf\nQuinnova: g\nQuinnova: g\n\nKeep in mind that the \"%%%\" comments were in response to the enemy team typing \"%%%\", and the \"get fucked\" was a tongue-in-cheek response to the enemy Teemo typing \"get fucked\" to me.

Do you think that deserves a 14 day suspension?","replies":[{"poster":"feelsbadman69420","date":"2020-01-04T09:31:42.127+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"same thing happened to me, now im scared to say anything in chat now because if I get banned again it will be perm","replies":[]},{"poster":"Typhoid Mary","date":"2020-01-02T13:03:12.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nah I don't and this just further shows that people who actually deserve bans get away with it and that the ban system is broken and is ineffective.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chopnblok","date":"2020-01-01T22:54:49.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tribunal system needs to come back.","replies":[]}]}
