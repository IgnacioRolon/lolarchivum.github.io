We have an already substantial discord in which there is a dedicated league sector for finding players for games, private voice channels, posting memes and finding new friends and if we can get enough people I would love to make tournaments for IRL prizes and prizes from Riot. I would love to make some teams to take place in tournaments but you can find out more information once you join :) Thanks for taking the time to read this and I hope to see you in our discord or to join you on Summoners Rift.\r\n\r\n[]( https://discord.gg/YFKvzmY )[](https://discordapp.com/invite/SeKXTQq)","replies":[{"poster":"Kãi Sà","date":"2018-02-06T07:12:11.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{summoner:-1}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blatant","date":"2017-11-19T12:07:55.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo this seems cool!
