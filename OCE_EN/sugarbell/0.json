Are they thinking about adding a progress bar for the honor system and 2. Is there literally no reward or use of honoring when your in a 5 man? And can we still get the everyone voting bonus in a 5 man?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-06-15T06:01:25.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. I don't think so, it's not to be something intended to be so well defined I don't think, maybe cause they don't wanna make it easy to abuse? Honestly I'm not sure, but if you just keep playing (even if you aren't getting loads of honours) as long as you aren't being a meaner you'll go up eventually.\n\n2. There is, the only change it that to get the loading screen flair for the next game (above level 3) you need two honours from premades or one from a rando, it's basically just to stop duos from trading honours, especially in ranked, it's not a huge issue but it makes the loading flairs a little more special you know?\n\nI'm not sure what 5 man bonus you are talking about, if you mean the post game lobby flair that shows when you get 3 or more honours then yes, you will get that even if you are in a five man afaik.","replies":[{"poster":"Kiragon","date":"2017-07-05T23:20:24.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The 5 man bonus is basically when everyone on the team honors somebody then everyone gets a little progress towards their honor level. It says it in chat after the game if everyone votes. Which is why I don't understand people that opt out of voting.

It's a little bonus, but not the be all end all. Apologies for not being aware of the bonus sooner however :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
