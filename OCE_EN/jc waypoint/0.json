Last season 4 i lost like 6 matches and won 4 and i got place into bronze 2. can somebody explain this to me! this doesn&#039;t make sense! and i don&#039;t think is fair to those player who played really well in their provisional series!\r\n\r\ni played so hard last season 4 when i was placed into bronze 2 and i kept going up and i finally reached silver 5 but why now do i get to place into bronze 2 this is awful!","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-14T09:20:08.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't, from human perspective. From robot perspective, this makes complete sense.\n\nFirst thing to grasp is that you aren't versing the exact same people in your provisional matches when you start a new season, and neither are you matched with the same team-mates. This has a huge effect on the amount of MMR you either gain or loss throughout your matches, and while in provisionals you have a MMR multiplier in effect.\n\nThe way you're decided to what division to be placed in based on your provisionals is that the game looks at the MMR of the people you were matched against and with; winning or losing doesn't really effect the outcome much (because you'd only be changing your MMR, and that usually counters itself). Eg. you win three games and get a higher than usual MMR, then you're matched into a game where you lose, thus your MMR drops back to its usual place, and you go into another game with that MMR, not the one from when you were on a winning streak.\n\nThere's a wealth of information you can discover on this topic if you're willing to research game theory; it has its roots in games as old as chess.\n\nBut you're probably just concerned about the work you have to do to get the end of season rewards.\n\nEh. Hope this helped clear things up.","replies":[]}]}
