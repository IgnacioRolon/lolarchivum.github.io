However, because of those same nerfs if he falls behind during early to mid game and he has no hope for the rest of the game. \n\nHaving played Shaco a lot across my accounts and in the beta before the stat wipe and after change from NA to OCE (Another stat wipe) theres a few annoying aspects about him I&#039;ve picked up on and I generally think he needs a rework in a small few details. These details you really need to understand; they come from playing him so much that they almost feel like bugs or poor coding. I&#039;ll List a few:\n\n**Decieve delay**: When Shaco casts deceive he stealth&#039;s then teleports to location which leaves a small moment where he is still. For twitch based reflexes this is extremely annoying as I have been hit by things as I deceive then die in the location I deceived to.\nThe same can be said about flash when deceiving; if I hit deceive then flash I will flash from the location I cast deceive then deceive to the location where my mouse was which, if you can picture it, leaves still in the place I clicked deceive.\n\n**Jack-in-the-box**: Every trap or small turret has some sort of scaling factor with the game as it progresses. Shaco&#039;s boxes do not keep up at all.\nIt is fair to say their health is low to stop people from being killed by a nest of them. However other champions have better successful trap mechanics, for example Zyra&#039;s plants have a three hit mechanic and a damage reduction on additional plants hitting the same target which I think Shaco&#039;s boxes would scale nicely with. If a champion with decent AOE damage is present in a team fight Shaco&#039;s box doesn&#039;t even get a chance to stealth.\n\nShacos boxes also count as second targets for things like Bards Q for stunning purposes. Even when fully stealthed the box can still be used to stun targets against and it takes no damage. \n\nThe tooltip for boxes say they will focus anything with two-shiv poison applied however if that target walks out of range and walk back into range it wont switch back. Boxes also fear targets out of their own range which is counter productive.\n\n**Two-Shiv Poison**: Nothing really wrong here. I think this is balanced. \n\n**Hallucinate**: There is delay on this ability as well. I use it often to avoid skill shots and certain abilities but there is a section just after the cast where you are still there and can be hit by anything. I understand it has a cast time and you can visibly see Shaco casting it but just after the moment where he disappears he can still be hit. I&#039;m just asking for it to be tighter or cleaned up to match it visually. \n\nCloning is also very predicable. The clone will always be on the left of his current orient. Although this also allows me to get over walls by orienting myself to it, I would rather it be more unpredictable. If you clone with any CC on you your clone wont have it. So obviously you know which ones the clone when it comes running at you full speed while your still lagging behind from wither. If they both started with the same CC condition Iwouldnt mind that or purges CC (If you&#039;re not stunned obviously)\n\nThese are just a few off the top of my head.\n\nAnother issue is a visual rework. He badly needs it. \n\nI don&#039;t like the ability to see fog of war orange clouds when hes trying to gank you. I don&#039;t understand why they allow it. \nIf you don&#039;t used the masked Shaco skin which has a completely different, very hard to see cloud you&#039;re an idiot. It&#039;s almost mandatory.\n\nEND RANT.","replies":[{"poster":"Darthski","date":"2016-02-18T03:26:33.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't agree more with the q delay. It just feels weird if I haven't played him for a while. And I always thought it would be nice if they made it so you could stack boxes up like can't does with here traps. It would be a nice buff but would be to op I guess with the endless fear you could do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2016-02-17T23:54:22.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And now when he has dusk blade he can R clone and can activate the item passive twice so on a full ad shaco you are not getting away any time soon","replies":[{"poster":"Oriphen","date":"2016-02-18T00:42:01.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is true but the damage is not as high as you would think, early game. And if you're rushing a duskblade you will lose out on your hydra for split pushing. Late game you are very much correct.\nGenerally I play a few different roles in the jungle depending on the team. Sometimes I'm AP, which is also where these issues need to be fixed. \n\nAlbeit the duskblade does need to be looked at on Shaco by the devs.","replies":[]}]}]}
