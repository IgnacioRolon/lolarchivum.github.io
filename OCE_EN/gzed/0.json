This is what happened to us:\r\n\r\nOur team is made up of: 1 gold, 1 silver, 2 bronze, and 1 unranked noob.\r\nOur placement games: WWLWW , 4-1 Win/lose\r\nOur team grading given:   Bronze III\r\nOur team MMR: 1550\r\n\r\nBronze III looks a bit low I think for that result - should have been at least low Silver, but I can wear that. So we start playing....\r\n\r\nOur first game after placements we get put with a Diamond V and some silvers.  WTF, you put us in Bronze III Riot so give us Bronze teams please.  Anyway, we won which was nice and got 35 points.  \r\n\r\nThen the next two games we&#039;re up against a Diamond, a Plat and 2 Gold&#039;s, then the third game they had 2 Diamonds and 2 Plats!!! Needless to say we got smashed in these next three games, and we&#039;re back to zero points.\r\n\r\nMy question: What absolute moron at Riot is responsible for writing the code that made this absurdity possible?\r\n\r\nIf you think we deserve to be playing teams of that level then why the hell rank us Bronze III?  Absolutely ridiculous.  It makes me want to stop playing, which is a real shame.","replies":[{"poster":"Holland","date":"2015-04-01T21:02:37.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe you mmr was really high and thats how you vsed them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AugustNightmares","date":"2015-03-31T13:20:31.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plus it's not just Ranked.

Unless you win all five placement games, it is pretty rare to get placed above the highest rank of your lowest rank member. \n\nNow onto the screwed up matchmaking. OCE in a teensy tiny server. At any one time, there are only a teeny tiny pool of players queuing up to play ranked fives. Matchmaking does favour to place teams of similar MMR together but with such a little pool to choose from, this is pretty much assured to never happen. If it were, your wait times would be 30+ minutes. So with matchmaking wanting to be rather fast, you get matched up with whoever is available. \n\nAs for those experiencing the same thing in norms and ARAM, ranked MMR doesn't effect these MMRs and due to high elo players getting to where they are by grinding ranked, they typically have the same normal MMR as bronze/silver/gold players. \n\nFor solo q, matchmaking depends on what time you play, with some times having more players available than others.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2015-03-31T12:52:15.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot must believe you have the skill of a diamond...FEEL PROUD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daejel","date":"2015-03-31T08:58:24.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FYI getting a ranked team into silver is like gold soloq. If your team was full of golds and you won 4/5 you'd get into silver 3 at best. Don't be too discouraged by being in bronze 3, after all you had 2 bronze on your team to begin with.\n\nReally though you should just be focusing on playing a few hundred games together to build synergy and understand objectives, rotations, etc. worrying about your ranked 5s ranking at this time is utterly pointless until you've consistently played together over time. Just focus on learning about each other and team comps for now and completely disregard your ranking if you actually care about improvement.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LollyKills","date":"2015-03-31T07:31:45.899+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"I resent being called an 'unranked noob' but I shall accept the title for the purpose of this argument.\nBeing matched up with people with such a higher skill advantage than us is appalling. It's very disappointing to check LoLNexus at the start of a game and see so many diamond, plat and high gold players. It really sucks that we got put in bronze 3 after winning 4/5 games, and then get matched up with people obviously out of our skill range. Seriously wtf. If this keeps up and we end up in bronze 5, we will be very upset, to say the least, and you will probably be getting a scathing post from our dear friend GZed as you have seen above^^\n\nSincerely, The Unranked Noob","replies":[{"poster":"pCake","date":"2015-03-31T08:05:55.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Betcha if we end up in bronze 5 riot will keep matching us with high lvl players :')\n\"OMG look guys, these guys are so good that they got into bronze 5, they need challenger players\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"pCake","date":"2015-03-31T07:28:19.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot ranking is absolute BS atm xD Placed with Plats and diamonds when you're placed into Bronze 3 is absolute crap!","replies":[]}]}
