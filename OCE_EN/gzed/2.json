There should be a way to set Intermediate as the default level.\r\n\r\nWhy do I even play BOT games you ask?  It can be fun to see if you can carry a 4v5 or 3v5 games, in which you are the only human on a team with less players.  It can be quite challenging and fun.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-11-02T11:32:07.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude you can 1v5 in bots if your not dense.\n\nIt doesn't train anything.","replies":[]}]}
