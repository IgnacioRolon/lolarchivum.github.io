It would be great if the \"Loss prevented\" system could be improved to detect major datacentre, interstate and/or ISP connectivity issues.   \n\nI'm not suggesting that people with bad internet or dodgy computers get benefitted by this.  What I'm saying is that a well designed server system could look for when multiple players are having continual trouble with connectivity, then run connectivity tests to the major city near where the affected players are, then consider whether a Loss Prevented is appropriate. \n\nIn my first game we had three players continually connecting and re-connecting.  One player eventually just gave up and AFK'd.  My ping was generally fine but I kept getting brief lag spicks that prevented spells from going off. I thought it might have been server related, but perhaps not.  \n\nNext I immediately queue again and this time the lag was happening to me - 1000 to 1500 ping constantly for the whole game.  I restarted my modem and relaunched the LoL client - nothing helped.  \n\nThese two occurrences in a row may not have been Riot server related, but they were certainly connectivity to the server related, and its was affecting many players.   It would be great if the Loss Prevented system could consider ping times and connectivity stability around the country.  If for example the Sydney ping to any other state suddenly became 1000 and stayed that way for a period of time then I think the loss prevented system should consider the affects on the fairness of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-13T23:52:31.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds like an amazing idea.
