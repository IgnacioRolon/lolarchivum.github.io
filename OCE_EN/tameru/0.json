It&#039;s also not hard to imagine Kalista being very similar to Undyne, Alistar to Asgore , a Kassadin that speaks in hands and perhaps even a Sans Karthus.","replies":[{"poster":"Colonel J","date":"2017-03-07T07:42:24.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Undertale SUCKS tho.","replies":[{"poster":"Tameru","date":"2017-03-09T03:14:00.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well you don't have to buy the skins then","replies":[{"poster":"Colonel J","date":"2017-03-09T06:07:44.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GeneralBoomer,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=ofb1hByJ,comment-id=00040001,timestamp=2017-03-09T03:14:00.451+0000)\n>\n> Well you don&#x27;t have to buy the skins then\n\nI'd prefer it not appear in the store at all.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-03-07T09:20:17.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rather subjective don't you think?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-03-05T14:19:44.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right about that Zyra one, but rest, not really.
