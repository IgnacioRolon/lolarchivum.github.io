People with bad ping (300+ ms) are basically not in the game it&#039;s always &quot;a summoner has disconnected&quot; &quot;a summoner has reconnected&quot;  but for some unknown reason they continue to walk to and dc die reconnect, rage at the enemy for &quot;bm&quot; then dc again and it is so frustrating playing with.\r\n\r\nWhat I&#039;m suggest (just for ranked) placing in a system that determines if your Ping is good enough to go through the whole game without disconnecting and reconnecting.\r\n\r\nJust an idea let me know what you guys think","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-03-12T19:57:19.234+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems like a good idea but we don't want to exclude players with high ping. \n\n300 - 500 ping is actually playable to some extent, and shouldn't cause _\"a summoner has disconnected\"_. I believe heavy packet loss and other symptoms of a bad connection will cause that, but not just ping. On **NA** I play with 260 ping and it's very workable, I don't see why 300 ping and a bit over might be unplayable.\n\nIt's really the summoners responsibility to assess whether they are able to play the game properly with their equipment.","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-03-13T00:38:25.792+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe instead it could just be an indicator telling you, but you make the decision of going into ranked or not.

For me, there's a very rare occasion that I lag for a whole game, and I don't know when it happens. Maybe once I've lagged in a ranked, several times have had lag spikes. Knowing before the game starts would be really helpful. It will also make people think if it's even worth doing ranked.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
