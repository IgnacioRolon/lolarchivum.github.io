Imagine if you could be in a queue for a normal game and a ARAM at the same time?\r\nI just want to play sometimes and I don't care what type it is. Whatever game I get into I could join instead of cancelling trying to get int he queue with the least amount of time.\r\nFeedback would be great.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-23T13:47:22.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I worry about people getting the queue up and then saying \"Nah, I change my mind on this game type.\"","replies":[{"poster":"SuperAthleteRox","date":"2015-01-14T00:23:37.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That happens currently, even with only 1 queue.
