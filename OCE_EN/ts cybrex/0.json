Because they always seem butthurt of lol\n?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\nBTW if my english isn't too good it is because I moved from Italy to Aus about 5 months ago and english is Ok but not the best","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-03-21T10:07:47.622+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"because it's the same genre of game, but different game. same reason cod player hate battlefield and xbone players hate ps4 player.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saldean","date":"2015-03-24T20:25:08.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a love and hate situation but from what I have read from the Dota2 Reddit and also reading from sites it was the problem about RiotPendragon's actions towards the Dota community. I can say that the League community and Dota community both have neutral opinions about each other but its the actions that were surrounded of what Riot has done during the time. Research it up for yourself, believe it or not but that's just something to think about.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-03-21T20:42:07.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dota2 reckons that LoL is too 'easy' which is true compared to Dota2, since Dota2 is so much more punishing for mistakes, however again, it's not like many people are willing to deal with these punishments and would rather play something just as fun called LoL...hence why LoL has more market.\n\n:P I play LoL due to how less stressful it is compared to Dota2. Call me noob for saying that? Sure thing, but I don't mind, I know my purpose in playing :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-03-21T08:34:17.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"either you're 7 years old or this is a troll post, no way you think it's spelled 'plaid'","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-03-21T13:37:57.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"BTW if my english isn't too good it is because I moved from Italy to Aus about 5 months ago \"\n\nHis English skill is pretty godly if he has only been learning it in the past 5 months if you ask me.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-03-21T13:36:22.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is what we call elitism, simple as that.\n\nThe fan base of a game that comes first within the context of the same genre would sometimes hate what come afterwards, and ofc in some cases, vice versa. \n\nMostly involves the earlier game calling the latter game a rip-off or idk, the latter game calling the earlier one outdated and jealous of the their success, but anyways. \n\nHowever really, they are in the same genre for a reason, so yer geez some people.\n\nThe first game of MOBA/ARTS is Aeon of Strife as a Starcraft mod if I am not wrong, so the entire hate war is pretty much pointless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shyvana Bot","date":"2015-03-21T10:31:32.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"8/8 Gr8 b8 m8 ill w8 4 next upda8","replies":[{"poster":"BrenskeKent","date":"2015-03-21T11:02:49.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dnt h8 m8 i dnt r8 f8ks","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GhostlyHell","date":"2015-03-21T08:16:10.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I started dota, went into league, still play both games frequently, I love both and their cool.
