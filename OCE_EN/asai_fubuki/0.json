(i'd literally rather see Shen ult as often he does, but whatever)\r\n\r\ni feel that you make all the character changes with mostly the pro scene and lcs in mind. the changes don't ever do any \"balancing\" for the players that aren't there. (i'm probably 99% wrong there and i'm willing to accept that)\r\n\r\n-hopefully you see this, regards Asai Fubuki (was known as Winter Demon)","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-01-17T21:39:52.317+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The removal of dfg can mean exciting new items (to replace it) and new builds for the assassins.
