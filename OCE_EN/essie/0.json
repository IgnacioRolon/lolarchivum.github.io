Never have I purposely left a game so I don't understand why I face the risk of a permanent ban after putting 4 years into this game with so much RP spent why should it be thrown away in under a month all because of this new LeaverBuster system which isn't actually fulfilling its intended purpose. Note; In every one of my dc games that have contributed to my penalties...I rejoin as quick as I can and catch up to win. If my teammates have no problem with it (actually they are usually very understanding/nice) then what's the big idea!? {{item:3151}}","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-25T07:41:54.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">after putting 4 years into this game with so much RP spent why should it be thrown away in under a month\n\nThis means nothing; don't use that as an argument.\n\nLeavebuster cannot tell the difference between your being disconnected from the game by crashing or you being disconnected by purposefully leaving. To it, it's both one and the same. If you're having such severe connection issues or random crashing issues, then don't play public game modes until you fix it. A part of the agreement which you signed includes the fact that you are wholly responsible for your connection - if it's faulty then you are the one who needs to fix it, not Riot.","replies":[]}]}
