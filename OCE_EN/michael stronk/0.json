And the other two I have played once or twice total.\r\n\r\nBut still cool to see that I get random discounts on some decent skins if I did play those champs.\r\nSo how was yours? leave a comment and vote below!\r\n\r\nMy vote is that it is ok, I mean the skins are awesome. it just seems weird to get skins for champs I don&#039;t play.","replies":[]}
