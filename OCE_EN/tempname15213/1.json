So you will hit minions, instead of hitting the enemy champion.\r\n\r\nI've tried using the 'attack only' button as well - but the problem here is that if you miss the target, it will not doing anything (better than running towards them), but what i want is:\r\n\r\n**Is there a way to attack move the CLOSEST ENEMY TARGET to the MOUSE LOCATION, so that if I miss the target by a little bit, as long as it's still the closest enemy target to my click, it will attack that, and move in range if it's not in range?**","replies":[{"poster":"Rav","date":"2014-12-15T10:39:06.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would \"Target Champions Only\" work? You use it by default from the tilde key ( ` ) or ( ~ ). If only it was toggleable, rebinding it sucks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-15T09:54:50.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"short answer no.\n\nlong answer, that would be pretty OP compared to ppl who dont use it.","replies":[]}]}
