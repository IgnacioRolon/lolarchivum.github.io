So I can record with LoLReplay, play with the alternative software?\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you could tell me the fix to BaronReplay or LoLReplay that would solve my issues too :)\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Rok","date":"2014-12-24T10:27:24.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you trying to record gameplay or analyse the game?\n\nIf your recording gameplay just get Open Broadcast Software (OBS) and record your perspective.\nelse\ntry fixing a replay system if u are looking for overall game analysis.\n\n\nIf you are doing the former, here is a link to some instructions for setting up OBS.\n[Ayy Lmao.
