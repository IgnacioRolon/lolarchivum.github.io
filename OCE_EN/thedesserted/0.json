Alright for the rest of the time. Didn't really stop to listen.\nYasuo's is damn awesome. So calming, found myself stopping to log in just to listen.\nSuper Galaxy Rumble is just pure epicness, found myself listening to it multiple times.\nLissandra's was epic all the way.\nPool Party log in is the shit.\nVel'Koz's log in should have been that moment where he stares down at Helmet Bro in his teaser video.","replies":[]},{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2015-03-26T07:42:24.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"where do u find the Champions music?","replies":[{"poster":"jb3navides","date":"2015-03-26T08:23:01.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2015-03-26T12:32:35.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2015-03-26T06:14:55.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get Jinxed is my favourite Champion theme, followed by Thresh's song.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-03-26T02:10:05.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amumu","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-03-26T01:40:38.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:34}}  This is biased though.
