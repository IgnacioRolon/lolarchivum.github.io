Out of 10 matches I&#039;d played 7 of those matches had at least 2 players arguing over minor mistakes for 3/4 of the game. These players often seemed extremely delusion and their ego was extremely inflated. \r\n\r\nWhen others decided to ask what rank the one being toxic was they&#039;d often say unranked or low bronze and in one case a player said he was Masters in Korea, which was just blatantly stupid. This seemed like a joke but, after some realisation it all seemed to link. Low rank, often blaming others and are completely oblivious of their own mistakes and can never accept failure. \r\n\r\nThese players really concern me as this may be a reason why a new players coming into the game may never want to play after encountering these players. I understand that League of Legends community is somewhat toxic but this shall be no excuse for such poor behaviour towards others at such a low level.  \r\n\r\nThis honestly appalled me, but I was curious has anyone else encountered other players like this at low levels?\r\n\r\nHave a good day, \r\nNerf Jg \r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"MÄ± Ke","date":"2017-09-24T07:56:45.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even in high-level you still encounter these things. But yes, it's just getting less as you climb the ladder.\nIn normal games, for high-level players, they tend to test the champions so yes it is common for them to do bad sometimes. For low-level players, they are on their way of learning the game and some of them are trolling\nThe best way is to mute all of them. You don't really need any communications in normal games anyway. Ping is enough and when they decide to give no fuck to your pings, no need for saying","replies":[]},{"poster":"OCE VortexDragon","date":"2017-09-22T12:02:49.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that many people in that level are smurfs. Their ego is inflated because they think they are good and deserve a better rank. Perhaps they think that they are playing with new players, thus, their egos are inflated and they flame low levelled players (Whom they think are new players but may be smurfs.) They also don't accept facts. While playing with my friend on low level (-_0), I noticed that they did not accept the fact that I was gold despite me showing proof to them. Generally, they are unaccepting, tilt-easy, egotistical and toxic.","replies":[]}]}
