Now I know people don’t play as serious sometimes, hence I wouldn’t be beating diamond players in lane, and other reasons as to why flex would be easier. I’m wondering whether there’s an actual difference in playing solo q and flex q in terms of rewards. (Not counting bragging rights couldn’t give a fuck) as in say I got plat or diamond in flex would my profile be showing diamond flex border or gold solo border? Is it better to just have a higher rank in either queue or is it better to have higher solo q in terms of rewards? Sorry for long winded post","replies":[]}
