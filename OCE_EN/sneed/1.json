Recently I&#039;ve began to have 50-60, and I hate it. Not trying to be a spoiled brat or anything, but detecting the change in ping is something that I think anyone can do. So because my ping is 30 normally, 60 is double my usual ping, and I think that it&#039;s fair to compare that to someone with 80 ping having 160 because of how we adapt to situations. \r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"GalgeLover420","date":"2015-04-02T03:56:03.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it is a solid 50-60 nonfluctuating ping then you should get used to it within 3 minutes. If it keeps jumping from 30 to 50-60 then you're having some kind of packet loss issue and that would be noticeable but it shouldn't be interfering with your ability to play. That being said, 80-160 is not comparable to 30-60 because not only is that level of ping dipping into a bad connectivity area that's a whole 50 ping more than the jump between 30-60, which is pretty big considering the jump is over twice as large and the total ping is almost 3 times as large, it's unfair to say something like that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-04-01T21:34:13.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm worse than you.
