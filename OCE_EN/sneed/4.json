So here it is, my Bronze Tier list (purely opinionated). Also note that I view the divisions as if most people are sitting on 20-30 lp, and not over 80, like seriously I'm the only person in my division up for promos, or even close to them.\r\n\r\n5 - Trolls and bad players. If people say they are too good for Bronze 5, I don't believe them.\r\n4 - Bronze 5s climbing up.\r\n3/2 - I feel like Bronze 3 and 2 are players that are actually decent at the game (not so much 3), or are climbing up from lower divisions.\r\n1 - I feel like Bronze 1 players are worse than 3/2, I think that Bronze 1 is for demoted players, much like myself in season 4 (however I am climbing pretty well right now)\r\n\r\nBonus: \r\nSilver 5 - Most are equal to Bronze 1 (let's be real)\r\n\r\nI look forward to comments.","replies":[{"poster":"Garu","date":"2015-03-05T09:45:18.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"from my experience of playing with lots of different people\n\nif you're(after 100 ranked game)\n\nstuck in bronze, \nyou still don't understand how to play the game properly\n\nstuck in silver,\nyour trading skill is sub par, takes too much free damage\n\nstuck in gold\nyou don't understand the importance of objectives\n\nstuck in plat\nyour mechanic/decision making just don't measure up to diamond player, and have  \"god complex\" which leads to trolling\n\nonly been to plat 1 so far, can't say anything about diamond player at this stage, until i get there","replies":[{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2015-03-05T10:26:36.301+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my opinion, 100 in bronze is pretty strange, if you haven't at least ranked up divisions once.i","replies":[{"poster":"greatdeathz","date":"2015-03-06T05:08:16.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there are ppl who play lol not just a few games but as an addiction and play hours on end, i believe this ends up making your performance alot worse as in no sleep etc... and constant playing will affect you dramatically. i look at these ppls histories and most of them have like 10+matches from the same day,","replies":[{"poster":"Garu","date":"2015-03-06T12:24:24.839+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, i only play 3 ~4 game max per day, really improve my overall gameplay + enjoy-ability of the game :D leads to less raging too\n\npeople underestimate the power of \"rest\"","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-03-05T11:01:14.472+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always thought Bronze 5 people should be a separate rank.

Sometimes the risk in playing ranked games are the expectations that they have on any other person within their game. It's a bizarre thought of mine but the mainly the knowledge of every individual player isn't enough and there are always cliche guides in telling them to \"not die\" and always \"ward\" etc.  \n\nI can agree with you in terms of divisions from your perspective from lower divisions (4-5) mid to high divisions (3-1) that are judged by many players who are climbing the ranks in solo q. :>","replies":[]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-03-06T06:41:04.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK here's mine- my highest is gold 5- but at that stage i was still climbing steadily.\n (ALL IN THEIR HEAD, THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE THINKING)\nBronze 5- absolutely brand new to the game.

If you find that you are being matched with people that a trolling a lot try and duo with someone so you two can carry the game. I recommend bot so you guys can do a lot of team work then dominate the lane then carry the game. This worked for me a lot. But what is the reason they are trolling though? This season I haven't been matched with any trolls yet only people that afk and are not very experienced make me lose so I am not sure what you can really do about the trolls =/","replies":[]}]}
