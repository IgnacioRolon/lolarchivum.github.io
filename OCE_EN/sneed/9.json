They have done a pool party set of 5 champions and I have no idea why you&#039;d expect them to do more. tbh I&#039;m waiting for Gnaruto. With all the talk of chroma packs, and how they&#039;re pretty much recolors, I think zac fans will realise that pool party zac will pretty much only be just a blue recolour, and that a blue chroma is exactly the same thing. So please, no more &#039;zac needs a new skin&#039; because chroma packs will be a cheaper version of what you would have got anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-05-01T12:44:37.817+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Jesus will people stop making threads asking for Zac skins, it wont happen soon... he has so much parts that they'd have to add it'll take to long and take too much effort to be worth it.","replies":[]}]}
