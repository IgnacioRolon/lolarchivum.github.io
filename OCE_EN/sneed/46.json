Come mid game we were ahead pushed mid, got inhib turret. Then, in one team fight, a wild Lee Sin appears and kicks a spinning Wukong into a very fed me, and then I get rekt by the other team. We lose the game.\r\n\r\nSo boards, what is your opinion of banning champions from your own team. I personally do it a lot if the champion is new, like Bard, or the people are too hyped to play them, as if first timing, OR they are last pick and they want Vi. Fuck that, I'm not giving Vi to a last pick, the enemy team will get it first by far.","replies":[{"poster":"iNoob","date":"2015-03-15T04:00:57.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been smurfing bronze and I have found that champions which tend to do badly are:\nYi (Can't see what 1v1s they will win and lose, basically try to 1v1 anyone) \nLee Sin (Can't take advantage of amazing early game, q into bad situations, kick free kills away, ks kills which could be used a lot better)  \nJinx (use w in a bad situation, causing enemies to catch up and rip her face off)\nVi (initiates retarded fights, can't land q on occasion) \nLeona (same as vi, and also misses e and r) \nPantheon (does both terrible and average) \nTwisted Fate (noobs can't farm, can't yellow, can't help lanes at right opportunity, get rekt trying to 1v1 LB) \nRiven (loses early game and gets blown up, always ends up committing suicide by going too going to deep with q and e)","replies":[]}]}
