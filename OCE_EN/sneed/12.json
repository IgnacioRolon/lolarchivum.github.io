I am interested in the opinions of others.\r\n\r\n:^)","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2015-03-05T00:48:35.749+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"My favourite champion seems to change each season, I get really addicted to playing someone different each time! Typically, I enjoy playing champions that make life awkward for the enemy laners, and force tough decisions to be made by the enemy. Here's my favourites and why!\n\nSinged - The epitome of being annoying and forcing tough decisions. Just to be clear, the best option is always to  chase the singed. Always. \n\nLulu - I love playing Lulu, as she seems to have unlimited options in most situations. I like that all of her abilities can be used in two separate ways, and how it's possible to frustrate assassins with the heal+shield / cc combo. I'm also a sucker for playing her in TT, with an auto-attack focused build with Nashor's and Lich Bane. It makes her a terrifying duelist with easy chases, big heals and lich bane procs!\n\nZyra - I love the turnarounds you can do on Zyra, and the sheer burst you can do from a support role. Her ability to control an area during a teamfight is pretty much un-matched, and her counter engage and punishing the enemy when overcommitted is pretty much second only to Janna. She's really satisfying to catch someone out with as a support!\n\nMorgana - Morg has been one of my mains since back in Beta, because she's very flexible and pretty much always effective to play in any situation. I love that you can play her pretty much anywhere at the moment, and she'll be a solid pick regardless. Her scaling and tankiness (that passive is big!) is generally underrated, so you can pull off surprising turnarounds even when behind. \n\n(There's a few more here like Karma, Annie, Leona and Kayle, but I don't want to spam any more D:) \n\n*What brings me to the boards?*\n\n Discussions like this! I love talking about League any chance I can get. :D\n\n*Most hated champion?*\n\nNot sure on this one! I still hold some completely irrational resentment towards Xin Zhao, Lee Sin and Akali from soon after they were released. For some reason, I've never been able to handle laning against a Blitzcrank unless I'm playing Morgana, so I guess that's probably my answer!","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-05T02:16:26.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel you on the Blitzcrank! \nFor me it's because it doesn't matter how many pulls you dodge, that ONE PULL can change a fight and in some cases the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2015-03-05T02:20:56.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Skyprus,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=9zYws5EM,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2015-03-05T02:16:26.540+0000)\n>\n> I feel you on the Blitzcrank! \n> For me it's because it doesn't matter how many pulls you dodge, that ONE PULL can change a fight and in some cases the game.\n\nYup! I kinda both love and hate him for it... Playing him causes a lot of the same \"forcing tough decisions\" from the champions above. He really makes decisions around how aggressive to be in lane really punishable if you make the wrong choice, and can really make it fearful for the enemy laner when coming back! \n\nHe can really also be unpredictably tanky with his passive, which can lead to a lot of fun barely-escapes. :D","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-05T02:22:49.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also if you are someone with good vision control, you have so much potential to set up picks from the fog of war. \nHmmm...

I have to answers to this.\n\nFirstly, my overall favourite champion is Anivia. I have played her forever. I think she is a great champion and greatly underplayed in comparison to others. In addition my favourite animal is a Snowy Owl and Anivia is the closest thing to that. \nSecondly, my favourite champion is also Thresh because of the diversity and play making abilities in his kit. I believe Thresh is the best support there is purely because of what he can achieve. \n\nWhat brings you to the boards?\n\nI first transitioned onto the boards when it came out. I have been on the original forums since the server came out. Back on the old forums I was pretty much a troll and a heavy necro. When boards came out I took it as an opportunity to reinvent myself and help the community on here by trying to answer as many of their problems and inquiries as I can if I can get to them before a Red. It is because of this reinventing of myself that I have been recognized by Marauder and Mirkinen etc. Whilst I do indulge in the odd troll post/comment I do still try my best to answer peoples problems if I can.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-03-04T12:20:38.222+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like Thresh as he provides TONS of cc and his Lantern (W) can rescue allies from tough situations.\n\nMost hated champion would be Vi, complete bs damage.\n\nI used to be on Forums.

I try to linger around and help out where I can, I love trying to share my knowledge and ideas for the game. I also love the Rioter's interaction with boards, its a nice feeling to have a Rioter respond directly  to your questions or thoughts. I also would one day to a massive chronicle of League strategy. I know I'm very far off but an confident that I will be able to learn every thing about this game. I want to be able to run a game down to the micro level in my mind accounting for everything single tiny thing. It will take time but I'm confident I'll be able to do it. I don't want to play off instinct, I want to play off  knowledge. :)\n\nOn to the other questions; \n\nMy favourite champion is Karthus.\nTo put it nicely I am mechinally inept Lol player.\nKarthus' kit is quite simple. Spammable AOE :). Easy combo.\nThe most skill you need is death positioning and flashing in and dying is something that fits right into my skillset.\nI also love the power that comes from ulting MWAHAHAHAhaha\n\nAs to my least favourite champion; Le Blanc.\nPurely because of the classic; can't play her or outplay her.\n\nThanks for reading, \nSkyprus ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-03-04T11:12:14.305+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"favourite champion: tryndamere; because he is extremely thrilling to play with his ult. same thing with rengar, but since they added the markers on his ult its useless almost unless they are running toward you out of stupidity (never happens really), kinda defeats the purpose of stealth if they are aware of you.\n\nmost hated champion: karthus; simply because of his power bubbles. %%%%s me up.\n\nwhy i come to boards: usually for news updates, sometimes there's interesting content around, and of course i want to get a feel of what the communities mood is","replies":[{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2015-03-04T11:22:59.245+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ Thanks for being the first reply.\n\nI find rengar kind of boring to play unless you are a god at him, his ult feels like your aren't even invisible with that indicator. As for tryndamere, one of my friends has a full crit page and it's hilarious to watch him level 1 duel the enemy :D\n\nUnfortunately, I haven't gotten around to playing Karthus, nor have I seen him played in about 100 games. He is 2nd on my next champ to buy list though. His q got changed to do more damage when isolated, right?
