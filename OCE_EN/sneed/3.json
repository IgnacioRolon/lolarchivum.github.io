Forget us, they are harming themselves. It's not giving it a bad reputation, it's called free advertising.\n\nAnd yes, I know Gore was banned by Twitch, but Krepo and Riot were the ones that complained to Twitch and got him banned.\n\nThere are stripper streamers that get naked on stream (that still do it, with no bans), yet Gross Gore and Tyler1 are hilarious and cool attitudes, and get banned indefinitely. \n\nThe Tyler1 post has 3.6 thousand dislikes so far, and they aren't budging. Riot is becoming less and less of friendly game creators and more and more of a dictator. They do what they want, and if you don't like it, they won't listen to their fans and change things, they will just silence you.\n\nIt's happening. First URF, then arguably the best League streamers get banned. They cannot listen to people and I don't know how we are going to do it but we need Riot to understand that even giant bigget companies like Blizzard listen to their fans because they know it's free money. Plus Meteos is more toxic than Tyler these days, even on stream, yet he complains to Riot and Tyler gets banned.\n\nSo therefore...\n\n#BanMeteos","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-05-01T22:48:55.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lurenza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=hGeFvnpp,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-05-01T14:17:26.728+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s a shame to see such an entertaining streamer be perm banned.
