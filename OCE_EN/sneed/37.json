It is not my internet itself, when I play other games I have zero lag (actually less lag than normal, ironically). I also don&#039;t think it is a firewall error, I followed every guide I could to making sure there were not firewall issues and nothing changed. I also don&#039;t get messages like &#039;firewall error&#039; or anything. Sometimes I disconnect from the servers on 30 ping and I have no idea why.\r\n\r\nTried playing with only league open, still laggy.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-19T01:23:11.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What OS are you on, and who's your ISP?","replies":[]}]}
