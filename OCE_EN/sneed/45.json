Spikes every 3 seconds or so to around 100 or 300 (never really in between). This is only happening on league I have tested on other games and my internet was been fine (constant 30-40 ping on au servers)","replies":[{"poster":"PixelPoro","date":"2015-05-01T03:45:15.275+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I've just started too get it the past 3 days.

It's like watching a stop motion, 10 seconds of each slide.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hazza1020","date":"2015-04-30T11:07:33.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this shit has been happening to me for a month only time i can play is 9am-3pm and even  then i sometimes lag","replies":[]}]}
