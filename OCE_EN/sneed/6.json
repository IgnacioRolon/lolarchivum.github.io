I&#039;ve seen on someone like Trick2g&#039;s stream bronze people in the same division as me (3) play like they are like level 10. I for one are better and so are the people who I&#039;m matched against (most of the time). So does OCE have a better bronze because NA has too many of them?","replies":[{"poster":"Jehovahs Witness","date":"2015-06-02T11:51:14.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Might as well do NA Challenger vs Korea Bronze V","replies":[]},{"poster":"Serfige","date":"2015-06-02T10:02:38.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Potayto, Potahto","replies":[]},{"poster":"Excited","date":"2015-06-02T00:12:59.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes and No.\n\n4 reasons why our bronze is different than NA's\n\n\n1. its smaller by the numbers.. \n2. Alot of people smurf in bronze which causes ALOT! of issues\n3. Our player base has serious behavior issues.. IE: Abusive, and self centered. and for the most part refuse to accept their faults and learn from them. \n4. Because of the 3 reasons above, our bronze players learn the wrong things and alot of bad habits regarding how they approach the game, which diminishes the quality of player as they slowly climb.\n\nWhats worse is, this is a snowball effect which wont change for quite sometime.\n\n\nSo to answer your question, NO! our bronze area isn't better then NA's","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-06-01T22:53:51.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your logic is kinda off. Having more players just means there is more people in each of the divisions (aside from challenger, which has 200 regardless of server size) and there is probably little if any difference between bronze 3 NA and bronze 3 OCE. Sure you might see other bronze players making terrible mistakes that you yourself would never make, but keep in mind that people in bronze have a very wide variety of strengths/weaknesses and its likely you are making equally terrible mistakes that you probably don't even realise but would be obvious to them.","replies":[]}]}
