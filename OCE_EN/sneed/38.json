I Actually Got It Right After I Graduated From High School.\n\nI Used To Live In Barstow, California.\n\nSo That&#039;S, Like, You Know, Heaven For Bike Riders.\n\nAnd Had It For A Couple Of Years, And Then My Brother And I Went On The Road As Musicians, So I Gave It To My Cousin, And He Gave It Back To Me A Couple Weeks Ago.\n\nI Haven&#039;T Seen It In 30 Years.\n\nIt&#039;S Kind Of Cool To See It Again, But I Don&#039;T Want It, So I&#039;M Ready To Get Rid Of It.\n\n- You Know, I&#039;Ve Off-Roaded My Whole Life, And This Is Just Cool.\n\nThese Were, Like, High-Tech When They Came Out.\n\nIt&#039;S Two-Wheel-Drive.\n\nIt Will Go Anywhere.\n\nThey Weren&#039;T Real Fast, Though.\n\n- Maybe 15, 20 Miles An Hour, Tops, Downhill.\n\nBut I Had A Blast With It.\n\n- These Things Were Designed To Take You Places Where No Other Vehicle Could.\n\nI Mean, You Can Practically Scale Walls And Go Up And Down Trails That Would Make A Horse Think Twice.\n\n- What&#039;S Up With The Huge Metal Things On The Tires, Man ? Three Reasons: They Won&#039;T Fill Up With Mud When You&#039;Re Off-Roading.\n\nYou Can Also Fill Them Full Of Gas.\n\n- So You&#039;Re Just Rolling Around With Gas In Your Wheels, Flying Around.\n\nYeah.\n\nThe Reason They Were Designed To Hold Gas In The Wheels Is So That You Could Ride To A Very Remote Area And Still Have Enough Gas To Come Back.\n\nAlso, You Seal Them Up, With Gas, The Thing Will Float.\n\nWell, [Bleep].\n\n- Gasoline Is Lighter Than Water, And When There&#039;S No Gas In Them, It&#039;S Air, So It&#039;S Definitely Lighter Than Water.\n\nSo The Thing Will Float.\n\nIf You&#039;Re In A Stream, You Can Walk It Across Like That.\n\n- Wow.\n\nI Didn&#039;T Know That.\n\nI Drove It In The Desert, So - You Know, I&#039;Ve Always Really Wanted One Of These, But It&#039;S Rough, Though.\n\nIt&#039;S Not Very Good Condition.\n\nIt&#039;S Obviously Got A Flat Tire.\n\nEngine Doesn&#039;T Turn Over.\n\nI Am Not A Mechanic, But I&#039;M Sure It Could Be Brought Up To Spec Fairly Simply.\n\n- It Feels Like It&#039;S Still Got Compression.\n\nIt Just Doesn&#039;T Have A Carburetor.\n\nThis Thing Is Rough, But I Think If I Can Get It For The Right Price, It&#039;S Worth It.\n\nWorst Case, I&#039;Ll Part It Out.\n\nBut, Man, I Really Want To Ride This Thing.\n\nSo How Much Were You Looking To Sell This Thing For ? - I Thought If I Could Get $2,000, I Mean, That&#039;S Kind Of What I Paid For It, But It&#039;S An Antique Now, So I Thought Maybe There Was Some Value There, But [Laughing] Well, Don&#039;T Laugh.\n\n- Yeah, I Mean, If This Thing Was In Good Shape, I Might Consider That, But This Thing Needs, Like, One Of Everything.\n\nI&#039;Ll Tell You What.\n\nI&#039;Ll Give You 500 Bucks For The Thing, And That&#039;S Just &#039;Cause I Think It&#039;S Really Cool.\n\nI&#039;M Not Gonna Go One Penny More.\n\nWell, Okay.\n\nI Don&#039;T Want To Put It Back In The Truck.\n\nIt&#039;S Heavy.\n\n- All Right, Thanks A Lot, Man.\n\n- Cool.\n\n- I Am Pumped We Got This Thing For Such A Great Price.\n\nI Just Need To Bring It To My Buddy Rick Dale, See If He Can Fix It Up, And If He Can, I Just Might Keep It For Myself.\n\nHey, How&#039;S It Going ? - Good.\n\nHow Are You ? - Ah, Pretty Good.\n\n- Good.\n\nI&#039;D Like To Sell This Gold Coin, If I Could.\n\nOkay.\n\nEight Escudos.\n\nThis Is A Spanish Stamp Here.\n\nThis Is, Like The Royal Crest Of Spain.\n\nSo Where Did You Get This ? - I Got That From My Grandfather When He Died.\n\nHe Left A Safe Full Of Contents.\n\n- Any Other Cool Things In The Safe ? Not Really, No.\n\n- No Holy Grails Or Anything Like That ? No, Not To My Knowledge.\n\nI&#039;M Going Into The Pawn Shop Today To See If I Can Sell My Grandfather&#039;S Gold Coin.\n\nHe Kept It In Plastic, So It&#039;S In Really Good Shape.\n\nLooks Really Old.\n\nAnd I Don&#039;T Really Have Any Use For It, So I&#039;M Gonna See What They Can Do For Me Here.\n\nDo You Know Much About This ? - I Don&#039;T Know Much About It At All.\n\nOkay.\n\nI Know A Little Bit About The Coin.\n\nI Mean, It&#039;S Eight Escudos.\n\nIt Was From Lima, Peru.\n\nThey Had, Like, The Worst Mines In The World.\n\nI Mean, It Was 2,000 Feet Deep.\n\nYou Would Go Down.\n\nThere Was Cave-Ins.\n\nThere Was No Ventilation.\n\nThere Was No Nothing.\n\nIt Was Just Really, Really Brutal.\n\nBut It Made A Fortune For The Spanish.\n\nSure.\n\n- When The Spanish Occupied Latin America And South America, They Used Forced Slave Labor To Work The Mines.\n\nIt Was A Brutal And Dangerous Job, And The Life Expectancy Was Short.\n\nCoins Back Then Were Weird.\n\nThe Size Didn&#039;T Have To Be Exactly Correct.\n\nIt Just Had To Have The Right Amount Of Gold, The Right Weight, And The Right Purity.\n\nWhen They Stamped These Coins Out, You Didn&#039;T Always Get A Great Strike Like This.\n\nIt&#039;S Almost Too Good To Be True.\n\nThis Coin Is In Exceptional Condition.\n\nAnd I&#039;Ve Seen Similar Coins Fetch Thousands Of Dollars At Auction.\n\nSo If This Is A Real Piece Of Spanish Treasure From The 1700s, I Want It.\n\nSo Do You Want To Pawn It Or Sell It ? I Want To Sell It.\n\n- What Were You Looking To Get Out Of It ? - I&#039;D Like To Get $2,000, If I Could.\n\nOkay.\n\nThis Coin Is In Really Great Shape, But This Is Easily Counterfeited.\n\nThere&#039;S A Lot Of Fakes Out There.\n\nSo I&#039;D Really Like Someone To Take A Look At It, If You Don&#039;T Mind.\n\nI Got A Buddy Who Knows Everything There Is To Know About These.\n\nI&#039;Ll Have Him Come In, And We&#039;Ll See What We Can Do.\n\n- Sounds Great.\n\nOkay.\n\n- Thanks.\n\n- Thank You.\n\nWhat Can I Do For You, Sir ? - Well, I Was Going Through Some Of My Father&#039;S Things, And I Found This Little Woody Woodpecker Toy.\n\n[Chuckles Musically] [Woodpecker Pecking] - I Decided To Come To The Pawn Shop Today To Sell My Antique 1950s Vintage Woody The Woodpecker Toy.\n\nAt First, I Gave It To My 21/2 Year-Old Grandson To Play With, But It Wouldn&#039;T Last Long In His Hands.\n\nSo I Thought I&#039;D Bring It Out Here.\n\nSomebody May Get Some Enjoyment Out Of It.\n\n- Woody Woodpecker Came Out Of Universal Studios In The &#039;40s.\n\nWhen You Went To The Movies, You Saw Three Or Four Cartoons Before You Saw Your Double Feature.\n\n- You Had To Go To The Movies To Watch Cartoons ? Yes.\n\n- What Would Kids Do On Saturday Morning ? - They Went To The Movies And Watched Cartoons.\n\nThis Is Probably Mid-&#039;50s Because Of The Plastic.\n\nEarly &#039;50s And Late &#039;40s, It Was Mostly Tin Toys.\n\nRight.\n\nThey Were Called Winders.\n\n[Toy Rattling] That&#039;S Annoying.\n\nChumlee, You Don&#039;T Know How Annoying You Can Be Sometimes, So Let It Ride.\n\nWhat Are You Trying To Do With The Guy ? You Want To Sell It ? I Thought I&#039;D Sell It.\n\n- You Got Any Idea What You Want For It ?

I Got This Massive Desire To Ride This Thing Out In The Desert.\n\nYou&#039;Re Being An Idiot, Pops.\n\n- Earlier, I Bought A Rokon Trail-Breaker Motorcycle.\n\nThis Thing Is So Badass.\n\nBut It Needs A Little Work Before It&#039;S Rideable, So Corey And I Are Taking It Over To My Buddy Rick Dale&#039;S In Hopes That He Can Fix It Up.\n\n[Horn Honks] [Chuckles] Whoa.\n\nI&#039;M Rick With Rick&#039;S Restorations In Las Vegas.\n\nAnd I&#039;M The Guy That Can Restore Anything.\n\nRick Never Ceases To Amaze Me With The Stuff That He Brings In.\n\nI Mean, You Never Know.\n\n- So Do You Know Much About Them ? It Was A Trail-Breaker, Man.\n\nIt Went Over Anything.\n\nLiterally It&#039;D Go Anywhere You Wanted To Go, Up Mountains, Through The Water, Rocks, Boulders This Big.\n\nIt&#039;D Actually Climb A Wall.\n\nIn Fact, Back In &#039;63, This Motorcycle Was Actually Tested With The Army.\n\nThe Rokon Was A Bike That Allowed The Adventurous To Get Out Into Places Where You Couldn&#039;T Even Go.\n\nI Mean, You Got The Army Looking At The Thing Because Of The Unique Ability To Do Almost Anything.\n\nYour Motor Is Running Your Rear Wheel And Your Front Wheel.\n\nIt Has An Override Spring Assembly In The Front.\n\nAnd That Is ? - What That Does Is, It Allows The Front Wheel To Spin Faster Than The Rear Wheel.\n\nIf You Didn&#039;T Have That, When You Were Riding It And They&#039;D Both Be Spinning At The Same Rpm, When You Turned, It Would Literally Throw You Straight On The Ground.\n\nWhen You Make A Turn, The Front Wheel Has To Spin Just A Little Bit Faster To Turn.\n\nNo [Bleep], Huh ? - Yeah, So What Do You Want To Do With It ? - I Want To See If We Can Fix It Up.\n\nYou Know, I Don&#039;T Know If I&#039;M Gonna Sell It Or What, But I Just I Got This Massive Desire To Ride This Thing Out In The Desert.\n\n- Okay, Well, In Order To Restore This, What We&#039;Re Probably Gonna Have To Do Is Strip It, Blast The Frame.\n\nIt&#039;S Missing A Carb.\n\nThe Seat&#039;S Pretty Trashed.\n\nWe&#039;Re Gonna Need Some Tires.\n\nAnd Then I Want Them To Go Through The Motor Totally, Make Sure Nothing&#039;S Cracked.\n\nThe Way These Things Are Driven, You Know, It&#039;S Got To Be Taking Some Beating, You Know ? - Yeah, So How Much Do You Think It&#039;Ll Cost Me To Fix It Up ? Well, At This Time, I Don&#039;T Think I Can Give You An Exact Price, Because I Got To Make Sure We Can Find Some Parts, And That May Cost You.\n\nOkay.\n\n- I Think Rick Made A Great Buy On This, But At The Same Time, I Think He Took A Huge Risk, Because Finding Parts Is Gonna Be An Issue, And The Restoration Cost Could Take Off.\n\nSo You&#039;Re Giving Me The Green Light ? - I&#039;M Giving You The Green Light.\n\nYou&#039;Re Being An Idiot, Pops.\n\nI Know It&#039;S A Risk.\n\nI Just Want To See This Thing Done.\n\n- I Think Your Heart&#039;S Just A Little Too Into This One.\n\n- They Got To Be Worth Some Money Restored, Right ? - Oh, Yeah, I Mean, That&#039;S A 1969, And They Didn&#039;T Make That Many Of Them, So There&#039;S Not That Many Left.\n\n- This Has Got To Be One Of The Coolest Machines Ever Invented In The United States.\n\n- I Couldn&#039;T Agree With You More.\n\nI Could Not Agree With You More.\n\n- All Right, Well, Let&#039;S Get It Done.\n\nAll Right, Rick.\n\nThis Motorcycle Needs Quite A Bit Of Work.\n\nBut If I Can Restore This, It&#039;S Probably Gonna Be One Of The Most Awesome Things Rick And I Have Ever Put Together.\n\nHopefully I Can Get Parts.\n\nWhat Do We Got Here ? - I Got A Big Collection Of Boxing Memorabilia From Probably Three Generations.\n\nOkay.\n\nLaila Ali.\n\nYou Know Who That Is ? - No.\n\nIt&#039;S Muhammad Ali&#039;S Daughter.\n\nShe Boxes Now.\n\nGirls Box Now.\n\n- They Do ? - Yes.\n\n[Laughter] [Bell Dings] - I Decided To Come In The Pawn Shop Today To See If I Can Get Rid Of My Muhammad Ali Boxing Collection.\n\nI Started Going To A Lot Of Boxing Events, And There&#039;D Be Programs On The Tables, And I&#039;D See All The Celebrities, And Nobody Was Making A Move On Them, And I Just Picked Up A Pen And Starting Having Them Autograph Everything I Can Find.\n\nThe Reason I Want To Sell These Is Because I&#039;Ve Got So Much.\n\nAnd I&#039;Ve Got To Start, Sooner Or Later, Getting Rid Of It.\n\nSo Tell Me About This Stuff.\n\n- Right Here, I Got A Muhammad Ali And A Laila Ali Father And Daughter Pair Of Gloves.\n\nTo Have Them Together, Those Are Very Rare.\n\nOkay.\n\nMuhammad Ali Trading Cards, They Were Only Made Once, Never Remade Again.\n\nMuhammad Ali&#039;S Album Signed.\n\nThis Was The Soundtrack From His Movie The Greatest Ever.\n\nAnd It&#039;S The Disco Version.\n\nIt&#039;S The Disco Version.\n\nWe&#039;Ve Got A Poster From The Super Fight, Way Back In The &#039;70s, Signed.\n\n- It Was Listed As The Fight Of The Century, And As Far As I&#039;M Concerned, It Was.\n\n- He Used To Say, &quot;Joe Frazier, You&#039;Re So Ugly.\n\n&quot; And He Would Say, &quot;I So Pretty.\n\nI&#039;M So Pretty.\n\n&quot; - Muhammad Ali Was The Ultimate Trash-Talker.\n\nI&#039;M Not Sure If That&#039;S A Good Or A Bad Thing, But It&#039;S Entertaining As Hell.\n\n- This Is The Infamous Muhammad Ali-Sonny Liston Fight With The Phantom Punch.\n\n- This, I Like.\n\nI Like The Sonny Liston Fight.\n\nThis Is A Rare Item.\n\nThis Is A Muhammad Ali Shaving Cream.\n\nAnd Once You&#039;Re All Cleaned Up, You Can Shine Your Shoes.\n\n- There Was Definitely Endorsement Deals Before Ali, But He Brought It To A Whole New Level.\n\nCome On.\n\nShoe Polish ?
