You can start using it sub-consciously due to over exposure.\nIf African Americans stopped saying %%%%%% every day, then maybe other people would stop saying it too.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-15T13:47:48.142+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I'm pretty much of the mind that either everyone can say it we don't let it have any more power than swear words as abuse (only in context), or no-one can say it and it holds it's place as hate speech. If you're going to reclaim the word to not be hate related all power to you, but if it's all about equality then it should be equal, not \"we can say it but they can't\". It just perpetuates the us vs them in a different and arguably equally as harmful way.\n\nIf a word is so offensive it can't be used in polite conversation (i.e not among close friends who understand the subtext), then that should be the end of it. I see it in TV shows and movies and I don't see how it's meant to be reclaiming the word when they just use it as another excuse to separate cultures and widen the gap.\n\nBut, that's from a white (practically vampiric) perspective. Not that I've never experienced discrimination, I fall into other categories often targeted, but it's never been racially motivated. I feel the same way about f%%%%% and assorted other slurs. Everyone, or noone. \n\nLike gay, it's only offensive if actually used as an insult, otherwise it's just a descriptor. The word itself has basically lost it's power as a slur (ignoring the meanings it had before it was a slur in the first place).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Anchovica","date":"2018-10-13T20:10:10.601+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Florence Welch","date":"2018-10-15T00:35:02.239+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This game is ridiculous. \n\nI had two chat bans so I've been really careful not to swear or say anything that could be considered abusive. However, I just received a 14-day ban for refusing to support an ADC. I didn't int. I didn't AFK. I was getting frustrated because we couldn't make any plays because she never had any mana. She was playing Sivir. I suggested she use her shield to get mana. She got angry at that suggestion. So I left lane, because I felt like there was nothing I could do for her, we just kept dying and I felt I was better off roaming. I continued to play the game, just not in the bot lane. There isn't a single swear word or insult on my reform card. If you read the entire transcript, the same couldn't be said for 3 of the 4 other players on my team. I bet they're not banned or restricted, though. Everyone on my team decided our team's loss was my fault and reported me, so bam! Suspended.  \n\nThe day I was banned, I played with people called \"[REMOVED - [REPORTING OTHER PLAYERS](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules)]\" and \"[REMOVED - [REPORTING OTHER PLAYERS](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules)]\". Not that I personally care what their usernames are but the point is, where's their punishment? Is Riot too stupid to filter the usernames for such obvious misspellings? Clearly the answer is yes. \n\nYou can also basically DO anything in a game . . . steal other people's roles, int, troll build, you name it, and nothing happens. But you SAY one thing and bam. You play a game with a duo and one of the duo doesn't like you? Bam. Two reports. You threaten to report someone because they've done any of the things I've just mentioned? Bam. They report you in retaliation. And Riot gives duo and retaliatory reports the same weight as yours. Pathetic. \n\nNever spending another cent on this game considering you can just be banned on a whim. \nAnd it's just completely pointless to ban anyway, because who doesn't have a smurf?","replies":[{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-10-15T00:41:54.505+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey mate, take a look at this thread on reddit, here's the link. https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/9lyha2/riots_public_stance_on_inting_sion/\n\nand now take your case up with riot saying that it's a strategy and really theres no reason to be banned because if you werent like you say you werent being toxic at all, just being strategical, then what can they say?

That said, Riot's punishment systems are also designed around the concept of reform, and so give players several opportunities to adjust their behaviour, which generally follows the progression of chat restrictions (10-game then 25-game) *then* proceeding to bans (14-day then permanent). So even if someone isn't banned, that doesn't mean they weren't punished.\n\nIt's always recommended (and preferred) to report using the post-game report feature, however if you believe that isn't sufficient, or that isn't an option, then you also have the option of submitting a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) directly (use the \"Report cheating, phishing, or negative in-game behavior\" option).","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-10-13T09:29:26.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sound like you are trying to bait man.
