I honestly think that people spamming bring back urf are delusional. The fact of the matter is bringing urf back is just is stupid idea. Be ready for the most epic flaming of the century. Think about it, next year there will be more \"bring back urf\"-ers and it will repeat itself, until they split in half and release eggs into the wild, which will then crawl into public libraries and spam the boards. This year people will complain about their favourite champions being banned and such. Just accept the fact that if Riot is generous enough to bring it back, then you should be respectful enough to not flame about it.\n\ntl;dr - you&#039;re adopted","replies":[{"poster":"BfM DevOuR","date":"2015-03-31T07:38:58.152+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"they already confirmed it is coming back you derp.","replies":[{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2015-03-31T08:13:23.121+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"No, nurf is coming not urf.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-03-31T08:26:36.766+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"exactly New Ultra Rapid Fire (NURF)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Untamed","date":"2015-04-01T02:45:19.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:13}} \nWas never op in urf ;)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-03-31T13:12:08.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"it is 11 minutes late, disappointed riot\ndisappointed","replies":[]}]}
