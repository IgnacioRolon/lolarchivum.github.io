This I believe is a fantastic change as it creates a new way of maneuvering and makes the player think more critically on their actions.\r\n\r\n_Five Point Strike_ shouldn&#039;t be spammed, however, be cast periodically where its benefits reach a higher potential.\r\n\r\nNow, most certainly the most controversial part of her new kit is the **True** invisibility from her _Twilight Shroud_. You&#039;re not mistaken, **True Invisibility!** This is as crazy as it sounds. You have the ability to avoid turret vision, pink wards and a massive list of abilities. There needs to be some sort of timer or fade in counter so that she doesn&#039;t instantly pop in and out. Additionally, a brief linger duration so she can move a small distance whilst not be detected.\r\n\r\n(Theoretically, It should be used to turn around 1v1&#039;s and have tense extended fights)\r\n\r\nHer _Shuriken Flip_ has incredible movement and can be used alongside her W and Q, hopefully leading to some incredible moments.\r\n\r\nFinally, her ultimate _Shadow Dance_ gives her even more movement and deals theoretically incredible amounts of damage. Obviously similar to Veigar&#039;s Ult and Pyke&#039;s X in terms of mentality.\r\n\r\nDue to her insane outplay potential, damage output, and phenomenal maneuverability, this in turn, needs some sort of weakness to counteract these strengths. Health, Armour and MR should be well below average to compensate for this. Some tips in my opinion to counter her are some champions with strong cc to shut her down.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this, I am open to any further discussion :)","replies":[{"poster":"NorthMate","date":"2018-07-17T11:12:40.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just saying guys - I might be wrong but this isn't the first time that there has been \"true invisibility\" in the game. From my experience, Teemo's passive actually functions the exact same as Akali's stealth - your position can be noted however you yourself cannot be targeted - therefore, \"True stealth\". Criticize me, however her stealth will not be as broken as you think.","replies":[{"poster":"NorthMate","date":"2018-07-17T11:13:13.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And if you disagree just test teemo's stealth with a friend. You cannot be targeted but can see your position WHEN YOU ARE MOVING.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-07-17T11:40:20.688+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The distinction is that true sight, like that of towers or Oracle's, will *not* reveal Akali, but it does Teemo. Hence the distinction between Obscured and Invisible (which along with Camouflage fall under the stealth umbrella).","replies":[{"poster":"NorthMate","date":"2018-07-17T11:46:55.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is true, however, it is stated that her position is revealed. And I am also pretty sure Oracles does not reveal Teemo, just shows his position, so the only major difference between Teemo stealth and Akali stealth is that she can stealth under tower.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-07-17T12:13:57.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I know Oracle's does, but I don't play much ARAM so I couldn't say for sure, at any rate turrets do. Sweeper reveals his position but doesn't make him targetable. I *believe* from what I've seen of the Akali rework that the only thing that reveals her position is damage, in the same way that Teemo's model will flash if you hit him in invis.\n\nBasically as I understand it, Akali has that extra layer of protection against True Sight and Sweepers.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kickalantern88","date":"2018-07-17T22:27:21.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lee sins q reveals {{champion:17}}  and makes him targatable as well as other forms of cc like airbornes im pretty sure {{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kickalantern88","date":"2018-07-17T10:37:31.256+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Indeed i do feel like the Akali rework is gonna be busted but it's a very unique rework. Her w lasts for 5 seconds instead of 8 and no teleport when casting w (however ult does cover shrouds teleport). Her w is still very busted though because she is detectable but untargetable including under turret range which is quite insane but if you think about it Vladimir can do something similar.\nHowever what I really like about a disadvantage of Akali is that she has to use almost all her abilities to kill one enemy and this may stop her from 1v9 everybody there. But if this is good if she is for e.g near baron pit and e, r q the combo... w to keep her agility and hide whenever she needs to. Ever since the assasin update came its been really good and has affected Akali quite significantly. \nI feel like Akali won't be really broken but will pick up loads of hype just like the aatrox rework so dw im hyped too.{{champion:84}}","replies":[{"poster":"Scoutswell","date":"2018-07-17T11:07:06.510+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am extremely hyped for this rework, I like getting to know a new kit, especially when it looks as fun as this one : ^ )","replies":[{"poster":"Kickalantern88","date":"2018-07-17T22:28:09.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hahaha, ofc this much hype was also in the {{champion:266}}  rework :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sharpaim","date":"2018-07-18T01:58:27.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just as hype for the new Akali rework - got onto the PBE to try her out in the jungle.\nShe has the bare minimum to jungle, which I'm sad about because her pre-rework version is capable of jungling.\nIt would be great if Akali's passive applied to the large jungle monsters, would help her clear the jungle faster and much more healthier. Her clearing right now isn't all to great. \nStill, hyped af.","replies":[]}]}
