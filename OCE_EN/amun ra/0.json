You&#039;ll either stomp your opposition or get stomped. I want to know where the fun from the game has gone? Like why does everyone in normals try so hard, and why does the game have to be so imbalanced that only 12 champs are any good? Like why?\r\n\r\nIn Normals, stop being so god damn toxic and being the worst kind of degenerates by playing the game in such a way that it makes it not fun for 90% of the community. You aren&#039;t cool kids, you aren&#039;t good at the game, just stop trying so hard and play for fucking fun by doing stuff that&#039;s different.","replies":[{"poster":"alsex","date":"2017-05-27T03:30:03.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The main issue with league..
