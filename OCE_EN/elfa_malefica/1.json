I once had an aram go for around a tad over 140 minutes, it was exciting sure, the back and forth and the  turn around were extreme but if I was just intending to farm keys the 20min (+10min waiting) matches of twisted treeline or regular 30min summoners rift matches would have been much quicker.","replies":[{"poster":"Elfa Malefica","date":"2016-11-30T09:02:09.936+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"are you seriously saying that rift games are shorter than arams lol.\ni've only ever had a couple of long arams, lasting about 45 and 60 mins, but really usually they last around 25.\nrift games last around 45 mins as far as i remember.\n\nand yes you can earn chests in the rift and the treeline also, the thing is in aram is easier because most people get a champ that they don't master so it's easier to get a higher score if you or your mates get one you are good at, so if one does good everybody gets one, even if their score is awful.\n\nmy conclusion is if you want chests go for arams, if you want keys go for treeline or rift with champs you are good at, since you only get keys if you win.\n\ni finished saying add me for aram not because i think they are the best for loots, but simply because i don't play rift because i don't like to get stuck in long games with toxic people, so 99% of the times i play aram.\n\ncheers!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Elfa Malefica","date":"2016-12-10T06:56:39.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bumpity bump {{summoner:31}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"BladeOfHam","date":"2016-12-01T10:54:38.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Playing tons of arams just made me feel, umm honestly, kinda sick xDDDDD.....","replies":[{"poster":"Elfa Malefica","date":"2016-12-01T11:08:35.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"look, i don't know, buy more champs maybe? i've heard of people playing only rift always same role always same champ because they have better win rate or counterplay in the current meta. now that would be f..reaking boring and repetitive for me","replies":[{"poster":"BladeOfHam","date":"2016-12-05T04:26:33.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha dude...On another server I ever played on, I had like 1000+ arams with the win rate of around 48%, compared to rift games less than 100.\nDuring that period of time I was just horrified to play rift mode because of both the lack of confidence and champs of me, and the rapid pacing of aram mode.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2016-11-30T12:54:42.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi :D","replies":[{"poster":"Elfa Malefica","date":"2016-11-30T13:32:03.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey monkey!
