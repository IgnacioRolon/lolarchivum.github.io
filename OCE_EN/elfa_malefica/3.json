(all free stuff yeah, but next point is what annoys me the most)\r\n- started a new account on EUW just to play, only to have to deal with, pardon me for the language, retards. Flamers, afks, kiddos, people adding me as friend only to wish me my mother and all my family died of brain tumor.\r\nAll this for what? Find out transfers are gonna be disabled for longer. Kinda expected it tho since this happened before and also you screwed up with Clash too so now that has priority. Oh yeah Clash, add it to the things I&#039;m missing.\r\nDone dealing with this sh*t. I want my account. Hurry the fuck up. I really hope transfers re-enabling date won&#039;t be shifted again.\r\nEnd of rant.","replies":[]}
