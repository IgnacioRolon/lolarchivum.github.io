Idk insert cool suggestions here c_c;;\n\nI imagine her** E** dropping little parcels her team can run over  to pick up, with different boosts like attack speed, run speed, health, a bit like pick-a-card on TF but for a droppable buff item. \n\nHer **ulti** would obviously summon her massive moose..bear..thing who would stomp in like a truck without breaks and eat someone. or perhaps pick up her and one other champ and dash them to safety..\n\nidk, but I like the idea of a grandma-yordle support, if anyone knows her name that would be awesome, ty :)\n\nBest wishes,\n\nluna","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-07-11T05:08:39.306+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's a whole wiki page on her bison's lore and stuff.\nhttp://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Appa","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-07-11T14:25:45.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha.
