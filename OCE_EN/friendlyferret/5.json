Lashings of maple syrup and a few crumbs on the Cryophoenix&rsquo; plate were all that remained of her first batch of pancakes.\n \n&ldquo;WARK!&rdquo; the great frost bird responded, bobbing her head in agreement. \n\nLooking out the window across the frozen Freljord, Ashe couldn&rsquo;t help recall the many battles these two friends had fought side by side defending their homeland. She wondered if she would ever have another comrade in arms she could trust as she did Anivia.   Rolling up the sleeve of her pyjamas for the tenth time so they wouldn&rsquo;t end up in the pancakes, she turned and gestured with her spoon,\n\n&ldquo;You know Anivia, I&rsquo;m really enjoying this time of peace, just catching up and hanging out..&rdquo;\n\nAshe&rsquo;s voice faded out, along with her corporeal form as she was suddenly transported from her kitchen. The wooden spoon clattered to the slate where she had been standing moments before. \n\n&ldquo;WARK!&rdquo; said the Cryophoenix in surprise, flapping gracefully from the table to the kitchen bench and scooping the pancake out of the pan and into her belly.\n\n&ldquo;WARK!&rdquo;\n\n---\n\nTaric was washing his hair.  It was a daily ritual that he couldn&rsquo;t afford to miss. He lay back in his gloriously over-sized bath-tub, bejeweled with the finest gems found anywhere in Runeterra,  reaching for the bright pink safety razor on the edge of the bathtub he began to lather up his chest with lavender soap.  As the thick application of conditioner went to work on his lovely auburn locks, the gem knight carefully removed the stubble from his chest.\n  \n&ldquo;Ugh so itchy under armor!&rdquo; He murmured to himself, catching a brief glimpse in one of the many mirrors surrounding his tub. \n\nA gentle but firm knock at the bathroom door announced the presence of his buttler.\n\n&ldquo;One moment Fredrick, I&rsquo;m almost..&rdquo;\n\nFredrick listened through the door to the sound of water rapidly rushing into the void that a second earlier had been filled by the most handsome knight in the land. Opening the door and setting aside his tray with a sigh, Fredrick began tidying the bathroom for his master.\n\n----\n\nHeartseeker Ashe blinked and gazed around at her new environment. She was frozen in place, sitting poised gracefully on a red velvet throne, a rose in one hand and an overly decorative bow in the other.\n\n&ldquo;Argh!&rdquo; Ashe exclaimed, eyes darting around trying to determine if she had company yet. &ldquo;Every time they put me in pink. Don&rsquo;t they realise how hard it is to run in this ridiculous outfit?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Ashe? Is that you bae?&rdquo; came Taric&rsquo;s smooth and slightly cheesy voice from somewhere below her.  \n\nGreat, just what she needed, the most handsome knight in all the land as her support, well as long as he paid attention and kept her alive rather than gazing at his reflection in his own shield.. There was a reason he&rsquo;d been demoted from the Demacian guard.\n\n&ldquo;Tell me you&rsquo;re supporting me and not solo-mid like the last time we fought together Taric.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;Supporting you all day long honey bee.&rdquo; came the reply.  Ashe rolled her eyes.\n\nA loud _KER-CHUNK_ noise heralded the selection of another champion.\n\n&ldquo;Owwwwww my spine!&rdquo; cried Frostblade Irelia from somewhere below.  &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s up there? Who have I got?&rdquo;\n&ldquo;Ashe and I so far honey&rdquo; Taric replied.\n\nIrelia muttered something unintelligible under her breath. \n&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Ashe called out, still frozen on her throne.\n&ldquo;Jungle! What are these summoners doing..&rdquo;\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be fine bae, stick with bot lane, I&rsquo;ll protect you.&rdquo; Taric crooned.\n\n_KER-CHUNK_, _KER-CHUNK_, came the next two picks in quick succession, Ashe strained her ear for any hint on who it might be. \n\nIrelia called out from below, &ldquo;Susan top, and ..&rdquo;, she was interrupted by a loud\n&ldquo;CAPTAIN TEEMO REPORTING FOR DUTY!&rdquo;\n&ldquo;.. Teemo mid&rdquo; she ended with a poorly hidden note of disappointment. \n\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me Susan again, wretch.  I am a son of Shurima, Ascendent of the Sun, You would do well to remember th..&rdquo;\n\n--- \n\nTime froze and Ashe felt herself cast into the oblivion before being violently wrenched back to the loading screen.\n\n&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t we ban Blitzcrank?&rdquo; Taric asked vehemently, &ldquo;And red side again? Red clashes with my pink armor..&rdquo; If he could have moved he would have shaken his fist at the summoners peering in to their screens. \n\nAshe did some quick mental calculations.   &ldquo;Blitzcrank and Draven bot, Udyr jungle.. Hah! We won&rsquo;t be seeing him for the next 35 minutes. Annie mid lane and Garen top. Nasus looks like a farm-fest for you guys buddy, not much going to happen up there.&rdquo;\n\nIrelia chimed in from somewhere to Ashe&rsquo;s left, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to need help with Udyr in my jungle Nasus, will you come down?&rdquo;  \n\nNasus said nothing, silently waiting for the battle to commence.  \n\nA squeeky little yordle voice broke the silence after several minutes had passed by,  &ldquo;50 gold says we&rsquo;ll get a potato reference as soon as we load in..&rdquo;\n\nEveryone groaned. \n\n---\n\nAshe felt herself suddenly standing on the stone platform of Summoner&rsquo;s Rift, finally able to move again.   &lsquo;[All] xXkillGuyXx (Draven): Dude, upgrade ur potato, lel&rsquo; flashed across the sky as the Nexus barrier dropped down. \n\n&ldquo;Gromp, Irelia?&rdquo; Ashe said as she rushed out the gate, biscuit, ward and dagger in hand.  \n&ldquo;Thanks&rdquo; came the reply as the two took up position around the Gromp camp.  \n\n&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your support Ashe?&rdquo; Irelia said. \nAshe looked around and called out for her partner, &ldquo;Taric what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; \n&ldquo;Damn it my summoner is AFK bae! I can&rsquo;t move&rdquo; came the distant reply from the Nexus. \n\n&ldquo;\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*&rdquo; Ashe said, glad for the obscenity filter.  &ldquo;Ok Irelia, let&rsquo;s make the most of what we&rsquo;ve got until Taric is back.&rdquo;  \n\n&lsquo;[All] FedoraBrony (Ashe): GG, \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* support afk&rsquo; lit up the sky to Ashe&rsquo;s horror.  &ldquo;What on earth are they doing? he&rsquo;s giving away our weakness!&rdquo; she exclaimed, not a moment before she heard movement in the tribush. \n\n&ldquo;Run, it&rsquo;s a gank!&rdquo; shouted Irelia as Ashe shot a volley of arrows into the bushes. A flash of metal flew past her head, grabbed Irelia and vanished with the blade mistress out of sight. \n*Whiiiirrrr* a throwing axe spun out of the bushes, just missing Ashe as she flashed head-first into a wall. \n\n*FLASH* suddenly Irelia, bloodied and wounded was back by her side. Ashe grabbed her hand and dragged her wounded friend toward the turret's safety with Blitzcrank manically cackling HAR HAR HAR behind them followed by Udyr and Draven.\n\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll pay for that cut dearly girl!&rdquo; Draven yelled as their assailants vanished back into the jungle. *FWOOSH* Ashe&rsquo;s summoner hit heal and several of Irelia&rsquo;s wounds were gone. Panting and safe under the turret, the two women gave each other a look of relief and exasperation as in shimmering light they both teleported back to the nexus.   \n \n&ldquo;What are you two doing ??&rdquo; Irelia exclaimed when they appeared back at their base to find Taric and Teemo engaged in a casual conversation about the therapeutic properties of boiled Bandle City mushrooms. \n\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;re both AFK it seems&rdquo; squeaked Teemo while Taric just shrugged. \n&ldquo;Oh no bae, you&rsquo;re hurt, what happened out there? I&rsquo;m so sorry..&rdquo; Taric said, concern visible across his gorgeous features.\n\n&ldquo;You saved my life back there Ashe&rdquo; Irelia said, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t forget that&rdquo;.  Their conversation was cut short as the sky flashed with summoner chat over head.\n\n[All] FedoraBrony (Ashe):  gg, pls report taric &amp; teemo!\n[All] xXKillGuyXx (Draven):  \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* \\*\\*\\*\\* waste of my time\n\n\n&ldquo;NEXT TIME GIRL, I OWE YOU A SCAR&rdquo; Draven hollered across the rift as the /remake sign splashed across the sky.  \n\nIrelia looked at Ashe just before they both vanished into the ether, their eyes met with a flash of comradery that can only be forged in the heat of battle. &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; Irelia said, and then they were both gone.\n\n\n---\n\nAshe materialised back in her kitchen, returned to the pyjamas she had left in so abruptly.  The hearth was now cold, her wooden spoon lay on the chilly slate and an empty pan told tale of her friend&rsquo;s exit.  \nAshe looked out the window once more, this time wondering where her new friend had been returned too. Picking up the spoon and dropping it in the sink she grinned, &ldquo;Just an average day in Runeterra.&rdquo; \n\n-The End -  \n\nby FriendlyFerret","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-07-01T08:43:35.038+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is a crepe.","replies":[{"poster":"xWZDx","date":"2016-07-01T09:35:20.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bonjour, Monsieur Crepe-Sama... :3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"veo","date":"2016-07-21T04:26:38.265+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"10/10 would read again","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T22:40:49.506+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Totally expected a joke entry, but this is surprisingly well done.
