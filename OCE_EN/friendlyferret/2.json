If I knew I was on 120 I wouldn&#039;t have played. It can&#039;t be hard to add a ping meter somewhere in the pre game UI can it?  Seems like a pretty easy win.","replies":[{"poster":"Lexhanatin","date":"2015-12-21T13:37:52.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.speedtest.net/\nthis works too","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-20T13:47:07.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey friendlyFerret,\n\nIf you need to check your ping before a session, you can always open up a custom match! Once you've checked your ping, you can close out of the custom match and queue up if there aren't any issues!","replies":[]}]}
