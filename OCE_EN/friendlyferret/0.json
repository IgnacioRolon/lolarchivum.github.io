Why do people feel like they can tell support who to play? Why is support different from all other positions? does anyone else get this?","replies":[{"poster":"Madi","date":"2016-06-20T22:59:42.207+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh you don't have to go with what they say, its about what your comfortable with and how you can win and carry your adc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-06-20T07:27:54.157+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a long time support main I've seen time and time again that people have an **ideal support** in their mind. It might be the flavour of the month, the champ they think synergises best with the comp (Lucians ask for Braum, Yasuos ask for Ali) or it might just be the champ their duo plays most often and they are familiar with. \n\nI wouldn't worry about it too much. If _you_ think they champ they are asking for fits and is one you can play go for it. If not, I'm sure they will understand.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Corehog","date":"2016-06-18T10:02:18.871+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's good to be flexible.\n\nIf your ADC wants you to play Blitzcrank, but you have no experience with him, it's okay to say no. You could possibly play someone similar, like Nautilus, or play a champion that is the exact polar opposite. \n\nIn all honesty, it doesn't matter what champ you choose to support with, as long as you and the rest of your team can make it work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-06-18T09:43:01.697+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably because you synergise with a counterpart as opposed to other lanes which are 1 on 1","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-06-20T06:53:35.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, every player who has the desire to play rank should have mastered at least 4 champs for each lane.","replies":[]}]}
