Why are these 1350 if they&#039;re a repackaged star guardian skin? Can&#039;t these just be a chroma or something? This just seems stupid to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-07T12:48:30.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the same reason the Star Guardian skins are 1350 to begin with. SFX, VFX etc, they tick all the boxes of 1350 tier skins. However because they are checking the boxes with existing content, you get a discount if you already own the Star Guardian skins themselves. \n\nPersonally I think the discount should be higher, and that 750 would be more appropriate and bring them in line with skins that change the model only (which if you own the SG content is basically what they are).\n\nI can see though why they can't just make them Chromas, the models are new, not recoloured.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-11-07T07:25:24.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because money.","replies":[]}]}
