This was happening I estimate about 50% of patches since season 3. As of season 5, I&#039;ve been noticing that every single patch cycle comes with this issue. And it's always just as a new patch (or hotfix in one case) comes out.\n\nTo clarify, double-clicking the desktop icon to start the launcher will start the little splash screen box, but it hangs there for a minute before telling me it can&#039;t connect. It doesn&#039;t even make it to the patcher proper.\n\nI have also been submitting network logs over the last two years, but not always. (Sometimes I&#039;m not really that bothered, so I&#039;ll just go play something else.)\n\nScreenshot attached. It&#039;s what happens on the day of patch releases, and then for another 3-7 days afterwards. Using a PC with Windows 7 (classic interface, but that shouldn't impact anything).\n\nEDIT: Admin launcher has exactly the same issue, both now and in the past.\nSome patches I've done a clean re-install.\nDoesn't solve the issue though. Still have to wait out the 3-7 days.\n\nEDIT: I'm unable to connect to the Support website at the moment.\nProbably not related, as I've been able to connect to Support even while having this issue in the past.","replies":[{"poster":"LittleMidNightPo","date":"2015-07-08T03:37:24.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try opening it from the Admin Launcher","replies":[{"poster":"ongelvin","date":"2015-07-08T03:42:18.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have been doing that.
