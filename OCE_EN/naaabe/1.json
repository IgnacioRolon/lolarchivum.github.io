My team was invaded, my top and jg died, then my top laner rq and never came back. We were holding lanes okay then my adc died and said &quot;thats it, im going afk too&quot; and left, along with the rest of my team. Leaving me to wait out the end of the game and NO ONE tried to come back. it was solo/duo not flex so they weren&#039;t a 4man. It doesn&#039;t seem fair that I take this loss..","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-18T12:03:30.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It always sucks when stuff like this happens, but unfortunately there's only so much that can be done without creating something that can be abused. Remake is the start of that, but it has strict limitations for a reason. You can't create a scenario where players can leave with no penalty without people finding ways to get around taking legitimate losses. \n\nIt's unfortunate, but you can't win every game anyway. The best thing you can do is to take a break, de tilt and then try that much harder in the next game.","replies":[]}]}
