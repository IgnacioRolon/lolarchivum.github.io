My ping has gone about 10 lower than usual and my frames are fine yet every so often I get massive delays and packet loss while in game. I&#039;ll be walking to lane and the health bars will disappear, things will skate around the map and nothing will look right, then everything will catch up and I would of died and I will be in an entirely different place than what I was looking at? Please tell me that isn&#039;t just me ;-; It&#039;s really annoying. I have small reaction delays as well and I don&#039;t know how to fix it or who I should be contacting about it. Overwatch works properly, Youtube works better than before, it&#039;s only League that dicks up.  I genuinely do not know how I am meant to fix this or anything and it does me a great sadden.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-12-20T06:56:35.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Take a look at this first, if your ISP is the problem this should make it pretty clear:\nhttps://lagreport.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/\n\nFollow thorugh the steps in this post next, it fixes most issues not caused on your ISPs end:\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/LbPY3Rpr-experiencing-a-tech-problem-find-the-common-fixes-here#connection\n\nAll else fails submit as ticket to player support detailing your issue:\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
