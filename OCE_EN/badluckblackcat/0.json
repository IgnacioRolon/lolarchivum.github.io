(well for me anyway)","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So I have had this bug a total of 2 times. Where my LoL patcher is updating then just freezes at 33% and the bug where is constantly is just scanning files and doesn&#039;t seem to have an end. Well. I found a way that fixed it for me. In the update to patch 6.12. I simply closed my league. And restarted my computer. And left it for about 15min. Then opened LoL again. \r\nBecause I had quit during the update, it did the never ending file scanning. But instead of closing and uninstaling and reinstalling league I left it. I don&#039;t know for how long. Because I just went and played Overwatch ðŸ˜‘  but when I did come back (probabaly about 45-60min later) it had finished. My hypothesis is that the scanning files &#039;glitch&#039; is the game going through ALL LoL files. And looking for incomplete and corrupted ones and fixing them. I hope this works for anyone with the same problem. \r\n\r\nP.S. I&#039;m writing this because the 1st time I had this bug I couldn&#039;t find any truly helpful and detailed posts. I&#039;m not 100% sure that there is a post about this issue. But I just wanted to help a poor soul out there who just wants to play LoL (I&#039;m a poet? Probably not!)\r\n\r\nAnyway thanks for reading my post and please tell me if it helped you or not.\r\nTHANKS!!!","replies":[]}
