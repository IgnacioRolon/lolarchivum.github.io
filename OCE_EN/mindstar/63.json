We don&#039;t expect there to be any impact to normal gameplay, but we&#039;ll be taking Ranked down as a precaution.  We expect this to take around 3 hours, at which point we&#039;ll enable Ranked again.\r\n\r\nIf there are any updates, I&#039;ll post them here!\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-11T10:42:53.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's no chance this would be for Dominion would it?","replies":[{"poster":"Reported4Verbal","date":"2016-02-11T20:50:24.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cyrater","date":"2016-02-11T12:49:50.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you tell us what this is for?
