I literally play this game alot but lately I have been staying away from it because I just continue to get put in the leaver penalty group and have a 20 minute ban for alot of matchmaking which is wrong in itself, I seriously don't see the point in wasting someones life for 20 minutes, plus it auto matchmakes as soon as the 20 minutes is finished so if your not in front of the screen watching your count down you will have to wait another 20 minutes with no progress on your leaver penalty !!!\n\nI would actually find being banned for a couple days more suitable because I really just see this system as \"perfect in the idea and intentions\" but in reality with network disruptions, issues with servers and all sorts of other uncontrollable circumstances players that have done right by the community are being wronged by the system that has been put in place to try protect them in the first place from AFK players.\n\nI still see AFK's alot even with the new system and still fail to see the point because of that. You may get rid of bad players but you are also catching good players in your nets which will make them turn away from lol if it keeps going on.\n\n\nNote -  I have tried the ipconfig /release | /renew | /flushdns which worked the first couple of times but has become useless now for me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Main Yuumi","date":"2015-03-19T09:18:33.264+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm getting this right now.

We made some network changes this morning as we found a possible solution to this problem.\n\nI understand the issue may of been fixed for you over the last week with some other changes that we made, but we are aware that for other players it was not. Thus we have made another change to help alleviate the issues.\n\nIf you have not already done so, could you please complete the steps above so we can analyze your data and see what could be causing this for you. If you have (I can see some reports coming in) then I thank you and we will work to get this resolved as quickly as we can.\n\n\nThank you again for your patience.\n\n-ToxicHawk","replies":[{"poster":"8ShadoWoDeath8","date":"2015-03-01T23:31:52.252+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"None of those steps are remotely relevant.
