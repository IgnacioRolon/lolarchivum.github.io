{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2014-11-04T04:23:56.788+0000","title":"Boards - Universal Rules","subforum":"Announcements","up_votes":11,"down_votes":7,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/E0XBRUT.jpg\n\nNo one likes rules, but some are necessary for people to co-exist with one another. These rules were created to prevent total chaos, and we've made a lot of changes based on your feedback. Our moderation team, will make sure that content posted is in compliance with the rules. Please take a moment to read them, and if you find content in violation, please use the report button to help us out!\n\nPlease note that the rules below aren't going to define everything that will be moderated, but one of the goals with these rules were to reduce as much ambiguity as possible. As such, we reserve the right to moderate any content in these Boards at our discretion.  \n\n---\n**Don’t be a jerk**\n\nWe’re aiming for the most sportsmanlike gaming community in the world, in-game and out. Just because you’re anonymous doesn’t give you a license to be an arsehat. Posts that walk over the line will be deleted. Repeat offenders may be permanently kicked out.\n\nModerators will take action against the following:\n\n* Players posting content that would seen as extremely offensive to others\n* Players attacking an individual or group in a way that could be considered severe\n* Players making baseless complaints or contesting private matters that isn't relevant to an active discussion\n\n\n**No Mature Content**\n\nThis one is a no brainer and important for everyone to read carefully. We know that this community tends to be more mature, but there are kids here, too. All of us want this to be a reasonably safe environment for children, and at the same time, we won’t tolerate childish behaviour. \n\nWith that in mind, many players vary in age, and there are some things that children and young adults shouldn't see. We don’t want to see any nudity, or real life gore. Violations of this rule will be dealt with swiftly, and seriously. You could lose your in-game account if you mess up here.\n\nModerators will look for and consider the following as violations of this rule:\n\n* Pornographic materials of any kind\n* Imagery that show real life depictions of gore, death, horrifically violent acts, etc\n* Art that shows genitalia, sexually explicit acts, or depictions of such\n\nAll that being said, even content you merely see as risqué can fall under these rules, and will be dealt with accordingly. So use good judgment, and stay classy.\n\n**No Spamming**\n\nThere aren't a lot of reasons to post the same content in multiple places. Every once in a while it makes sense to cross-post, but if it’s not appropriate, the subsequent posts will be removed. Repeat offenders will be hit with restrictions. Remember, your desire to show the whole world something doesn't mean it should happen. If you want visibility on a post, post it in the right place, and make sure the content is solid.\n\n**Adhere to Board Guidelines**\n\nWe want each community to have it’s own unique culture, which makes it important for you to post content in the correct place. Each board has detailed Guidelines that should make clear what’s acceptable, and what’s not.\n\nModerators of each sub-community will evaluate your post against the Universal Rules and the customized Guidelines set for the official boards. Content that isn't appropriate for the board will be removed.\n\n**Account, Product, &amp; Service Promotion**\n\nIf you’re trying to promote or sell a product or service, there are other websites for that. If you’re trying to sell a game account or service that violates our TOS, please don’t; however, if you absolutely have to try it here, expect that you'll be losing access to the boards and possibly your game account. TL;DR: posts attempting to sell anything will be removed. Serious offenders will feel the wrath of the banhammer.\n\nModerators will be looking for the following:\n\n* Advertising for product sales of any kind\n* Advertising for services offered by individuals or companies\n* Coupons or discount information that doesn't contribute anything to the conversation\n\n**Reporting Other Players**\n\nPlease don't name names.  If you see or hear about another person breaking the rules, send us a ticket directly so we can investigate and take action if necessary.  We know that players report publicly with the best intentions, but it often leads to a witchhunt, rarely resulting in a positive discussion. We'll be taking action against players who have violated rules, so please report these players correctly.\n\nModerators will be looking for the following:\n\n* Posts that accuse others of being toxic players in-game\n* Posts accusing others of malicious activity\n* Posts that accuse others of cheating or using illegal services\n* Posts accusing others of trolling in the boards (there’s a report button for that)\n\n**Hacks &amp; illegal downloads**\n\nDo not share links or information related to obtaining illegal software. To us, this includes cheats or exploits that create an unfair advantage in-game. We’ll be removing all links and posts that give such information. Repeat offenders will lose access to the boards, and in some cases, a lot more.\n\nModerators will be looking for the following things:\n\n* Posts with links to download software that give an unfair advantage in-game\n* Posts that link to pirated movies, music, software, etc.\n\n**Illegal Activity**\n\nCriminal masterminds, or aspiring criminal masterminds: please don’t talk about your activities or plans in these boards. Posts about illegal activity will be escalated to law enforcement.\n\n**Threats**\n\nMaking threats on the Internet is just bad form. We don’t tolerate it, and neither should you. Threats of any kind will be handled differently depending on severity, but all posts of this kind will be removed.  Extreme instances will be escalated to the proper authorities. Be cool, dudes.\n\n**Phishing &amp; Scamming**\n\nTrying to get a leg up on others through scamming, or forcing an account breach is a serious no-no. This is theft. It’s stealing from your fellow players. It’s pretty shitty. We have a whole team at Riot Games dedicated to battling this crap and they take it seriously. \n\nModerators will be looking for the following things:\n\n* Posts about services claiming to be an RP generator\n* Links to cleverly disguised phishing sites\n* Posts designed to bait someone into a trap\n---\n\nNow that that's out of the way, let's all just have a good time!\n\n*Last edited on 19/11/2014*","replies":[{"poster":"Kieshwa","date":"2014-12-05T12:04:10.534+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"No mature content\"\n\nOnly immature content it is then","replies":[{"poster":"Goldendo 2","date":"2014-12-08T13:35:59.010+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This man knows whats up","replies":[]},{"poster":"JimmyJJones","date":"2019-12-01T05:56:36.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah yes, a fellow big brain.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rav","date":"2014-11-24T09:19:55.749+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"But what if being a jerk is my nature.\n\nSo racist, Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"His mum","date":"2015-01-21T20:10:10.091+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rav,realm=OCE,application-id=3fteLeTW,discussion-id=BjArMH2B,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2014-11-24T09:19:55.749+0000)\n>\n> But what if being a jerk is my nature.\n> \n> So racist, Riot.\n\nJerk is not a race....","replies":[{"poster":"Rav","date":"2015-01-26T02:23:18.593+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hikariyume,realm=OCE,application-id=3fteLeTW,discussion-id=BjArMH2B,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2015-01-21T20:10:10.091+0000)\n>\n> But just what if, what if I was joking...","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-09-29T04:44:48.761+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont assume his Race this is 2016 Goddammit","replies":[{"poster":"FROG PR1NCE","date":"2017-07-31T04:37:19.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2017 and there are 20+ genders now, still counting.","replies":[{"poster":"Termagent","date":"2017-08-27T07:27:39.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you put a 0+ there by accident there's just two man {{summoner:14}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2014-11-19T23:11:43.079+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love the use of casual language.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wiggy","date":"2014-12-12T04:22:44.318+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Come now, nobody likes rules? apparently you haven't seen how hot headmistress fioras' pixels are ;)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2014-12-04T20:12:59.963+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> **Phishing & Scamming**\n> \n> Trying to get a leg up on others through scamming, or forcing an account breach is a serious no-no.
