Very annoying.\n\nMy internet is running fine, tried repairing, this isn't my end that's acting up as I've been playing quite a while with the shop working fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-08-24T01:40:27.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Kegstar - is this still an issue for you?","replies":[{"poster":"kegstar","date":"2015-09-10T05:30:11.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the wait, it was until the last patch, thanks for getting back to me. :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"YuHX","date":"2015-08-30T20:15:29.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the login page is black when I click \"launch\" button.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erinshaw","date":"2015-08-21T05:43:50.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I remember in my gaming life of 30 years  Never download on patch day.   Well I did both I installed the game for my grandchildren.  Everything worked fine on the tutorials.  Then came the patch.  For me it downloaded fine.  IT ran and started up-----got back to tutorial----started the 2nd one---made the selections pressed play and-----black screen which minimizes to the task bar-----I can hear the music but nothing zilch nada. The minimized black screen remains and nothing happens.\n\nI googled tweeted gaming friends tried all the ?fixes suggested for similar earlier events----nothing\nI re-installed after uninstalling prev version\nDid file check\n\nIt remains the same nothing but black screen\nIs this just a tutorial bug or is it game wide---I wont let the kids login and ruin someone elses game experience\n\n\nAll ideas welcome","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-08-24T01:40:02.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Erinshaw,\n\nThank you for getting in touch - hopefully it is a simple fix.\n\nReinstall sounds like a good option - when you did this, did you go through the full steps to remove the old version? [see here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends)   \n\nI'd also suggest you make sure your system is all up to date (drivers, windows updates etc).\n\nIf you're still having problems, your best bet will be to send in a support ticket.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Doledrums","date":"2015-08-20T12:17:10.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I try to launch League I get an application error saying \"the application was unable to start correctly (0xc0000005)\"\n\nI have made sure to run as administrator and uninstalled and re-installed the LoL client. A google search brought me to a solution stating that I have hacked or infected files which has me pretty worried. I have malwarebytes doing a scan at the moment though it has yet to pick up anything. The same solution suggested using the CMD to check my BCD (I hope you understand this because at this point it's just jibberish to me) but I read that I would need my Windows 7 key as you need to reactivate windows which is a problem for me as this is a secondhand computer and I don't have that information. \n\nI should also note that prior to this issue I started up League as usual and when it started to patch I had a blue screen with a wall of text I don't remember and I had to restart my computer. \n\nSo that's where I'm at hopefully something Riot staff or friendly user can help with!","replies":[{"poster":"Doledrums","date":"2015-08-22T03:26:32.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like I must not have uninstalled correctly as it seems to be downloading the latest patch after another re-install attempt.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Doledrums","date":"2015-08-20T12:21:48.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh and before all of these issue happen when I try to open the app through lol.launcher.admin I get a message saying I have an instance of LoL currently running.
