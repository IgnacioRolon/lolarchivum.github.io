Basically, you are what rank you should be for your skill, and if you want to climb higher you'll have to focus on improving not just playing your best.\n\nScores in Silver and below tend to be quite polarising, with games being heavy one way or the other (i.e they snowball more) which results in harsher losses (but also better wins), and at the end of the season stakes and tensions are higher exacerbating this effect.\n\nThe best thing you can do is keep your cool, getting frustrated at things you can't control will only make you play worse, especially if that translates to typing all game. Better to focus on what you *can* control, which is your own gameplay.\n\nAlso if you want to have a player behaviour discussion, better to have it in the Player Behaviour sub-board, and not on a random announcement thread, further comments of this nature will be removed.","replies":[{"poster":"NORBIT1234","date":"2018-10-29T08:47:04.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Ive played 8 hours in a row and i havent even gotten anywhere causw of bloody trolls and afks and what pisses me off is there always in my fucking games its so annoying how do you guys get rid of these kunts getting really sick of this game","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-29T11:46:01.523+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Playing any game for 8 hours isn't exactly recommended, especially if it is causing frustration and you aren't enjoying yourself. It may be ranked, but it is still a *game*, and if you aren't having fun, or at least competitive satisfaction, it's definitely time to take a break. \n\nMy general policy is no more than three games in a row before taking at least a half hour, and if I lose (or sometimes just if it's a frustrating loss) I take at least a 10 minute break. Trust me your sanity and *your skill* will thank you. You'll play better when you're calm and focused that tilted off the face of the earth coming out of a bad loss. \n\nThen there's all the typical advice like remember to drink water, don't play games on a starving stomach, eat decent food, get sunshine and at least a little exercise etc etc.\n\nTrolls happen, it sucks, though sometimes what we view as trolling is just a misplay or bad decision. You can't control trolls though, and if you get frustrated and start losing games, especially games after theirs because of it, then that's a big fat victory for them. Focus on what you can control, and if it's a loss, report them, take a break, and don't let them affect you beyond that.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kamishiro","date":"2019-08-13T02:34:48.754+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also can you make it so you can look at the skins you own on the website or mobile app please? {{summoner:39}} {{summoner:31}} {{summoner:32}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"HÃ¬mari","date":"2020-02-04T18:42:45.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe it's an ad, but take a look!
