I'll be posting updates to this thread as we have them.\n\n**Update - 1105 AEDT**:  Loss Prevention has been enabled and Ranked queues disabled while we troubleshoot further.\n\n**Update - 1155 AEDT**: We've identified the cause of the issue, and are making changes at the moment to fix it.  We'll keep Loss Prevention on until we are confident that it is fully resolved.\n\n**Update - 1305 AEDT**: Connectivity has been restored to normal.  Loss prevention has been turned off again and Ranked has been re-enabled.\n\nWe're really sorry for the bumpy morning.  The League platform has quite a few moving parts that can break from time to time.   We're looking over what happened so that we can level up, and make sure this part of our systems won't fail like this in the future.\n\n\nThanks\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Solidify","date":"2015-03-04T00:02:34.836+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, so.. \n\nFor a total of 5 games i had\n\n2 games with 2 DC\n3 games with 2 DC\n\nFor a total loss of 89 League points.\n\nNow riot, we all understand that this happens and that you're currently trying to address the issue - That's great.\n\nThough the problem is.. how is it fair, for not only myself, but every other good hearted league player to lose so much LP to this DC problem, in which you haven't stopped ranked queues, nor have you hit the loss prevented button. \n\nIt is to my believe that without a rollback, you are going to have many angry and upset summoners on your hands. Which will include myself.\n\nPlease take this seriously. As i love this game, though why should it be to my detriment that you have a connection issue with your client?\n\nUpvote for Rollback, kind summoners.","replies":[{"poster":"Matutinus","date":"2015-03-04T00:10:46.380+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yep, doing ranked promos, get firewall error, lose two promo games because dc counts as two losses. and 20 minute wait time for my troubles, so good","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xelvi","date":"2015-03-03T23:42:34.223+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why haven't you pushed the big red button for loss conceded?
