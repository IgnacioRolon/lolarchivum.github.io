The clash feature has experienced similar issues in other regions as well, and we have Riot engineers working around the clock to understand the cause.\n> \n> At this stage, we're not sure whether or not we'll be in a postition to run Clash in OCE on Saturday.  If you are planning to play, please keep an eye on this thread and we'll update it with further information when it is available.\n> \n> For those that missed out on Friday, we're really sorry that it didn't go as planned, and still considering what can be done to make up for these issues, but for now the efforts are focused on getting things working.\n> \n> Mindstar\n\n-----\n\n**UPDATE 2 @ 11:15 PM (25th May)**\n\n> Hi folks\n> \n> I just wanted to add another update here, as the first couple of posts in this thread were fairly rushed while we were in the process of figuring out what was happening.\n> \n> Here's what we know now:\n> - When the first round of clash games were meant to start, they uhhh... didn't.\n> - A large number of teams were awarded losses as a result.\n> - The ticket auto-refund system has kicked in\n> - We won't be starting any more clash tournaments tonight, as we don't yet know what caused it to fail and can't guarantee it wouldn't crash again.\n> \n> We know many of you were excited to play clash tonight - many of us at Riot were too! It isn't acceptable to us that the experience tonight played out this way, and while right now we've got all hands on deck focused on solving the immediate problems with the clash system, we're also very conscious that you have taken time out of your lives tonight, and we weren't able to meet your expectations.\n> \n> We're still working on it, and there will be more info to come about what happens next when we know more.\n> \n> Mindstar\n\n\n-----\n\n**UPDATE**\n\n> When the scouting period ended and clash games were meant to start, there was a server issue which caused some games to fail as a result.  ~~The clash system has resolved those games randomly and assigned a winner/loser.
