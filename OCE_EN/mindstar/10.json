It's where you get news, talk with friends, fiddle with runes and masteries, and queue up for your next game. The launch of the alpha marks the first step on a journey.","url":"http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/client-update","image":"https://am-a.akamaihd.net/image?f=http://lolstatic-a.akamaihd.net/global-elements/0.0.29/images/oce-ratings-logo.png&resize=185:"},"up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://am-a.akamaihd.net/image?resize=646:&f=http://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/upload/lead_image.jpg\n\nWhen we announced [the 2016 Season changes](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/2016-season-update/client-update.html), we talked about plans to launch an alpha test for the League client update. Today we're opening alpha sign-ups for players interested in helping out. We're in the process of building this bad boy **right now**, so expect the alpha to be a bit of a bumpy ride. If you think you can handle it, head here to [learn more and sign up](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/client-update).\n\n**WHAT IS THIS ALPHA BUSINESS AND HOW DOES IT WORK?**\n\nhttp://am-a.akamaihd.net/image?f=http://news.cdn.leagueoflegends.com/public/images/articles/LCU/2016/april/asuo/releasecalendar.jpg\n\nPlayers deserve a better client, so we're building one. The alpha is a chance for players to help us make the client as good as it should be. It'll be released in stages, piece by piece, until it reaches beta and replaces the legacy client. Since we want to ensure stability on our live game servers, each major update will launch first on the PBE before we push it to the global alpha (which is connected to the live servers that everyone plays on). We're thinking of the PBE as our first line of defense for the client alpha&amp;mdash;although we won't be collecting feedback here, it lets us catch catastrophic bugs early so we can focus on getting the feedback that really matters from our alpha testers. \n\nThis alpha is an experiment for us; we haven't opened up our development process to players like this since the very earliest days of the League beta.\n\n**DEETS ON THE RELEASE SCHEDULE**\n\nWe'll be pushing out releases roughly every four weeks or so, with the very first release hitting about a month from now. That will include ARAM and the blind pick Summoner's Rift queue only. Later, we'll add other redesigned client features like the profile section. Ranked, draft queues, and custom matches will appear near the end of the alpha (release order may vary).\n\nhttp://am-a.akamaihd.net/image?f=http://news.cdn.leagueoflegends.com/public/images/articles/LCU/2016/april/asuo/LCUArticle_Image_Timeline2.png\n_We'll keep an updated timeline on the website that will let you know where we're focusing and what's coming up next._\n\n**QUICK NOTES ON FEEDBACK**\n\nIf you join the alpha, you're becoming part of our construction crew, so we'll need you to actively participate in the process. As releases hit the PBE, we'll share plenty of messaging about the latest stuff we're pushing out. When the updates hit the alpha, we'll ask you to focus your feedback on the area where we're focusing our development (aka the current focus area). Your engagement with us is vital to the success of the alpha - as we charge forward with subsequent releases, we'll regularly release devblogs and changelogs to highlight the things we're learning and changing based on your feedback. This is a call-and-response show, not a solo performance.\n\n**SOME EXTRA STUFF TO KEEP IN MIND**\n\nThe alpha isn't secret, so feel free to share screenshots or videos of the client with anyone. Take the alpha to a nice restaurant where people will see you together. Bring the alpha to your family reunion so you can introduce it to your parents.\n\nNot everyone who applies to the alpha will make it in. We'll start out slow, limiting acceptance to level 30 players with no history of negative in-game behavior. We're accepting PC and Mac players from all regions, but the initial alpha release will likely exclude players with super low-spec machines (it won't be optimized at first, and we don't want people to have a bad time). Once this replaces the legacy client, it'll work on any computer that can currently run League.\n\nThanks, and we look forward to having you join us! We'll be hanging out in the comments for a bit to answer any questions you have.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-04-28T04:40:45.547+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Take the alpha to a nice restaurant where people will see you together.
