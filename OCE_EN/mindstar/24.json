Especially on smartcast!\nThe old system worked just fine, why change?\n\nThe new vector casting makes it feel slower and also harder to judge the size/direction of the particle, the mouse movements on it now feel weird in combination with her other abilities.\n\nI have played Taliyah pretty much non stop since she came out, I'm lvl 7 mastery and she has passed almost all of my other champs in points, so In my opinion i know her quite well, and i believe this a step in the wrong direction for quality of play for her.\n\nAlso (on smart cast at least) its nearly impossible to make it knock up without throng in a direction, which is incredibly frustrating if youre trying to hold them in place for an ashe arrow or something of the like)\n\nIf theres enough community feedback about it, could you please at least consider looking to change it back?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-13T02:07:55.466+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">The old system worked just fine, why change?\n\nIt really didn't, it was clunky as hell, and coming from someone who has taken the time to get used to vector casting on other champions, it's a change that was basically required, and hell should have been put out on release.\n\nAs for the Ashe Arrow sort of thing, throw them into the Arrow, not straight up.\n\nIt takes time, but you will get used to it, and once you do, you will find it is way better.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-07-13T02:43:51.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A little clunky is okay when the champion's theme is 'Rocks'\n\nWell ill give it a fair try.
