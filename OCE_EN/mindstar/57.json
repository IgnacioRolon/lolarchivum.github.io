We&#039;re aware of an issue at the moment with our patching service, and we&#039;re working to fix it.  Stay tuned for updates in this thread.\n\nHopefully we&#039;ll get it fixed up nice and quickly so you can get back into game :)\n\nCheers\nMindstar\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-08-24T08:33:08.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"**UPDATE**\nWe've released a fix that should be applied when you start up League.

Whether or not you are affected depends entirely on OS version and windows updates that have been applied. We've put together a fix for the issue, and we're moving ahead to get the patch to all players ASAP.  This may take a couple of hours to get out the door as we need to do some final testing before we can release it.\n\nThe current ETA is that we should be putting the fix live at around 4pm AEST, at which time you'll hopefully be able to patch and log in.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Viagra","date":"2016-08-24T04:05:15.716+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://puu.sh/qMhcd/32edbb6861.jpg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"1 800 CARRY YOU","date":"2016-08-24T01:22:34.586+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Believe","replies":[]},{"poster":"Joccey","date":"2016-08-24T10:36:27.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have always experienced issues logging in after patching.
