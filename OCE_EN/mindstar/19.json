Please let us know if you are seeing any continued issues on your end.\n\n**UPDATE 9.00pm AEST** Thanks so much for sending in your trace routes.  It has helped us to identify that the same provider is still being used between Telstra and Riot, but at a different point in the pipeline now.  We're changing our routing again so please let us know if things improve.\n\n**UPDATE 7.55pm AEST**  Despite disabling the provider showing issues, it looks like some players are still experiencing problems.  We're looking into it, so please do keep the trace routes requested below coming in.  They are helping us immensely.\n\n**UPDATE 6.55pm AEST** We have identified an issue with a backbone provider which was causing packet loss to our platform.  We've disabled the path through them which should force a different route for affected players.  This should hopefully resolve the issue so let us know how it goes.\n\n**UPDATE 6.30pm AEST** We're after some info from affected players.  Read the [pinned post](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/n9F6RgnQ-client-issues-8th-apr-2016?comment=0009) below for instructions on what you can do to help us find the source of the issues.\n\n**UPDATE 6:18pm AEST** We're seeing symptoms of elevated disconnects & logins coming from players on Telstra and Optus networks (possibly resellers too).  We're digging further but it might be related to a localised outage affecting those ISPs.\n\n\n**Original Post**\nWe&#039;re aware of issues with the client behaving strangely and issues of lag/disconnects during champ select.  Our team are looking into the problem now and will keep you up to date as we know more.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-04-08T08:29:12.494+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're working to find out where the root cause is for the issue, so If you are still unable to connect to games can you please do the following:\n\n* Run a [trace route](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq2) to **prod.oc1.lol.riotgames.com**  (do **NOT **trace to 103.240.227.5 in this case)\n* Note your local IP address (you can find out by visiting http://www.whatismyip.com/)\n* Note your ISP and Location (city)\n* Send this info to our collection email address - ocelivereports@riotgames.com\n\nThis will hopefully give us the necessary information to find out where the source of the problems are.","replies":[{"poster":"TrashBad","date":"2016-04-08T10:27:59.638+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"will there be any form of compensation for players lost LP due to dodges with this glitch, queue timers and the like due to hitting accept but not processing, also an rough ETA on a hotfix?, i cant queue\n\n I have followed and send the info and trace in.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-04-08T10:31:54.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for sending this in.
