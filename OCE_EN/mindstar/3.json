We estimate the battlegrounds will be unavailable for approximately 4 hours.\n\n\n** UPDATE: 10/9/2015 @ 0930am AEST** The second part of the maintenance is now complete.  We're going to keep Ranked offline for another 30 mins while we ensure everything is running smoothly.  Thanks for your patience folks!\n\n\n** UPDATE: 9/9/2015 @ 1545pm AEST** TPG peering is back online, so everything should be back to normal for TPG players.\n\n** UPDATE: 9/9/2015 @ 0900am AEST** The first part of the maintenance has been successfully completed and the server is back online.  We're on schedule for tomorrow for the second part.  \nDuring the maintenance, we encountered an issue with our peering link to TPG - as a result, players on TPG may experience some issues with sub-optimal routing while we work with them to bring it back online.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions you might have here.\n\n\nBest Regards\nAgent Mindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-09-09T23:29:55.580+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi folks,\n\nWe're back online now, but we'll keep Ranked offline for another 30 minutes while we make sure everything is running smoothly.\n\nThanks for your patience this last couple of mornings.\n\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Kyu","date":"2015-09-10T00:05:24.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yo ranked queues aren't up, where they at?
