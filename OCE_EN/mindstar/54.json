At this time, games in progress will end in a draw and stats will not be recorded.  To ensure Ranked games are finished in time, we will be turning off ranked 30 minutes earlier than normal, at 0330 AEDT, which allows time for up to 90 minute games to finish.\n\nKeep an eye on the [service status](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#oce) page and this thread for updated messaging during the maintenance.\n\nAgent Mindstar","replies":[{"poster":"poostabbinz","date":"2015-03-10T19:29:53.162+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"any updates on when the server will be back up?","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2015-03-10T20:15:28.010+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's up.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xRageamok","date":"2015-03-10T01:06:17.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are we getting Patch 5.5 this week? \n\nWould be a shame to see the server go down twice in such a short period.\nUnless you can't do this maintenance and a patch at the same time. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-03-10T01:17:25.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We haven't finalized the patch timing yet for 5.5, but will let you know as soon as we do.\n\nThis kind of maintenance actually affects our ability to deploy patches, so can't be done at the same time as a patch (it would result in potentially a very long outage).\n\nAdditionally, we generally look to avoid doing too many changes at once during an outage, to reduce the troubleshooting time and impact of potential issues.","replies":[{"poster":"xRageamok","date":"2015-03-10T02:23:00.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair enough!
