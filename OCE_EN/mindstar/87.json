Ranked will be turned off at 0430 ahead of the reboot, to ensure no games are being played when we shut down.  Players in normal games at that time will be disconnected.\r\n\r\nKeep an eye on the [Service Status](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#oce) page for any updates to the plan!\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nMindstar","replies":[]}
