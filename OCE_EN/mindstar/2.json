Starting with the next patch, Oceania will be moving up from Thursdays to Wednesdays. We&rsquo;re also taking the opportunity to shift downtime a bit to better match when most of you are offline. (Neat side-note: this means Oceania will be the first region in the world to receive future patches)\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ll provide more timing updates as we get closer to enacting this change.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this let us know in the comments below!\r\n\r\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"MightyBlackJesus","date":"2015-08-11T05:17:02.346+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":53,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Space Pirate","date":"2015-08-11T05:39:14.107+0000","up_votes":104,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey look!
