Suffice to say it was quite a doozy, but it looks like our servers are recovering now.    I'd expect that some of you still stuck in Ghost games might be in that state for a little while to come, but it looks like we're not seeing new ones being created.   If you have recently finished a game and are stuck (18:15 AEST or later), I'd love to know.\n\nOnce we verify everything is tip-top, we'll get Ranked turned back on.\n\nThanks so much for your patience today - it really sucks for all of us when things aren't going smooth :'(\n\n\n-------------------------------------\n**UPDATE @ 1730**\nAnother update for you all - Our engineers have made some progress, and are starting to hone in on the root cause.  Unfortunately we're still not fixed up yet, but I'll hopefully have something a bit more concrete soon.\n--------------------------\n\n**UPDATE @ 1615 AEST**\nJust a quick update - we're still trying to find the cause of this. At this point we're still not any closer to finding the cause, but we are 100% on the case and throwing everything we can at it. I'll post another update in an hour, or if we have more progress to share.\n\n\n-----------------------------------\n**Original Post**\n\n\nContinuing on from this mornings messaging with a fresh thread here.   We&#039;ve been seeing an issue today that is causing players to see the Reconnect screen after finishing games.   This can persist for some time and prevent players from starting new games.\n\n**Where are we at now? (1500 AEST)**\n\n* We have restarted the OCE servers, but the issue is persisting.\n* Ranked Queues have been disabled for now, as some players have been reporting inconsistency in LP rewards and promo games.\n* Our engineering team is on the case and investigating all possible causes\n* We don&#039;t have an ETA on a fix yet, but will keep you posted in this thread.\n\nThanks for your patience folks, we want to get you back in game ASAP!  Any questions, hit me up here ;)\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2017-09-26T09:19:54.566+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hi all\n\nJust a further clarification to the 1830 update.  For those of you who are still stuck in Ghost games (aka. seeing the reconnect screen for an old game), this can take some time to clear on each account.   We're confident that as of 18.30 no **new** ghost games were being created though, which is what was being referred to when I mentioned the cause of the issue was fixed.\n\nI'd expect that over the course of the next couple of hours the remaining ghost games should clear, and we can get back to what we do best (in my case, feeding :rip: )\n\nThanks again for your patience.  We're getting there...!\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"NakedWhiteBoy","date":"2017-09-26T09:34:13.065+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"Those of us that are still affected deserve compensation we spend money on this game and should be able to use the product that we pay for","replies":[{"poster":"rv joy","date":"2017-09-26T09:57:20.408+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You chose to spend money of your own free will so stfu","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ã¦on","date":"2017-09-26T09:52:47.223+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NakedWhiteBoy,realm=OCE,application-id=3fteLeTW,discussion-id=q5p0cT8H,comment-id=00270002,timestamp=2017-09-26T09:34:13.065+0000)\n>\n> Those of us that are still affected deserve compensation we spend money on this game and should be able to use the product that we pay for\n\nIt's a free game, money you choose to spend means nothing to that.
