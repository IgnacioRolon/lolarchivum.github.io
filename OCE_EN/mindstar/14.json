I don't know why but when ever you press right shift it activates the glitch but then if you press it again it de activates it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IS19be36f0783cadc7383de","date":"2015-03-24T11:23:09.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like it's Mac Client based issue.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cat of Kanagawa","date":"2015-03-25T03:13:56.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(Mac client only) Ok, I have the solution to this bug where you cant open stuff up, what you have to do is either; quit the game (takes forever to load back up) or you can spam Control+shift or Control+enter and then spam Escape within each one.

So my issue is, sometimes when i die (which is quite often) there is a chance that my game bugs out and instead of the right click being blue, it goes red/orange. I also cant access the store, options or character info and I can't level up my abilities. When I am near an enemy or an enemy minion, it prioritises attacking the minion/enemy over moving. I play on a MacBook, so I'm not sure if this issue is popular.\n\nThanks for taking time to consider my issue and remember to stay frosty :P.\n-Moreton","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lumer","date":"2015-03-13T14:40:18.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In twisted tree line, the item Ludens Echo is available to buy, however, it requires a needlessly large rod which you are unable to buy.
