During this time it won&#039;t be possible to perform store transactions - eg. purchasing skins &amp; champions.  We anticipate that the store will be unavailable for approximately 2 hours.   \r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Aish","date":"2015-09-24T10:47:45.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure if there is a problem with today's shop maintenance but you can't buy anything at the moment. I've created a thread and many people are also experiencing the same issue. We have enough IP to buy a champion but the store says we don't, as if we are missing IP. \n\nThe thread explains more.
