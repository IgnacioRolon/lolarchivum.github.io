I have tried all the settings \"low spec mode\" \"close client while in game\" My CPU fan makes a loud noise, fps has dropped from \"200 - 300 fps\" to like 100 but it fluctuates so much making it harder to play. Ping has risen up by 11 :S \nReally should of kept legacy version until this was 100% completely done ! and don't say its done.","replies":[{"poster":"Dungeon Warlord","date":"2017-04-11T21:55:09.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"200-300 fps????? You are wasting CPU usage on Graphics enhancement that are not necessary for this game. \n\nThe human eye sees motion from films at 24 fps and cannot tell the difference , anything over that is just overkill (unless you are playing fps type games).  If you are getting fluctuations, the frame rate of 100 fps would not be the cause. \n\nYour ping rate could be an issue. I use a LAN cable as it gives a more steady and consistent stream than WI-FI does(way less spikes from dropped packets).\nIn Ulladulla I have a steady 37ms with a 100 Mbps connetion (this is quite reasonable to play this game), in Sydney this drops to 18ms with a 1 Gbps connection using the same computer. \n\n\nHope this helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Trickster","date":"2017-04-12T04:04:24.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I was just mentioning that My FPS was much Higher and that Alpha is not optimized. \nPing has been fine from When OCE had fixed all there problems till Yesterday which is probably 2 years Now. All of a sudden ping has increased. As I said my normal ping was 21, and now it's 35 its definitely different. I have played this game way too long enough to know lolz (7 years) I am using Ethernet. Nothing of mine has changed for the past 2 years besides changing to Alpha Client which i'm beginning to suspect that they run on two different servers. This is probably going to take them very long time to deal with unless they bring back legacy.\n\nSpeed test gives 17 latency and use to get 21 ping normally in game,\nAlso 37 is your normal ping, I'd be use to it as well.  using abilities has a slight rubber band effect which indicates packet loss or server side issue to which I Have already checked.\n\n\nThanks for trying to help.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-12T04:20:05.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game client and the splash client are not the same.

Either by next patch it will get fixed or this is going to take ages and might need to have a long break sadly.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-12T14:56:05.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These problems are native to your client not to Riot, i.e the problem is on your end (that doesn't mean it's your fault of course, there's a lot of things that can cause it).
