This will likely result in you getting stuck in some form if you are trying to play right now.\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re aware of the issue and it should be fixed up shortly, but worst case will be sorted after the patch is deployed.  That release is scheduled to start in approximately 1 hour from the time of this post (6:00am AEDT).\r\n\r\nReally sorry if this has messed up your early morning LoL fix!\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2019-01-23T19:04:56.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"UPDATE @ 0600 AEDT\nThe oce servers are down now for the 9.2 patch, and will be available to play on again once the update is complete.
