This was following on from yesterday morning, where a number of players were experiencing connection issues.\n\n*Rito plz!?  What is going on?*\n\nIn short, this is not the kind of player experience we are aiming for.  We want to provide you with a stable service, and we are constantly working make sure it stays that way.\n\n**Here's a quick rundown of what has happened:**\n\nYesterday, we received quite a few reports of players experiencing all kinds of connection issues.  When we investigated this, we found that there was a piece of network hardware having issues that needed to be addressed.  We were able to mitigate these hardware issues and restore our service, ensuring that yesterday afternoon & evening there was a stable game experience.\n\nOvernight, we experienced a different issue.  Shortly after 3AM AEDT, one of our internet connections went offline due to a major equipment failure at our provider's end.  While we have multiple internet connections in place, this failure caused some knock-on effects to our game servers, and seriously disrupted our network.  This was actually quite similar to the issue experienced last week - see [here](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/NJth0tul-follow-up-on-the-server-issues-25022015). Our network engineers were able to identify & bypass the failed link, bringing the game servers back online.  \n\nWe aren't 100% out of the woods yet, as the failed connection is still down (our provider is waiting for parts arrive to their datacentre), but we are in a place where games should be running smoothly using our other connections.\n\n**Next steps:**\n\nThese issues seen over the last week have highlighted a couple of areas that we definitely need to work on regarding the stability of our network.  This is something we are taking very seriously and working to address in the near future.  That said, changes of this nature aren't instant and require careful planning, but we are working to address the root cause of these issues as soon as we can.\n\nThanks for your patience.\n\nAgent Mindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-05T02:50:49.165+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for taking the time to explain what the issues were, and I'm glad to hear that Riot are working to implement more secure servers for future.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-03-05T02:39:43.298+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am a happy chappy","replies":[]},{"poster":"AweClaw","date":"2015-03-06T09:55:15.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for that insight I am absolutely delighted to see this post as I have been wondering what was going on lately thanks again","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hi Aunti","date":"2015-03-06T00:19:01.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"still unable to connect...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bongo Bongo","date":"2015-03-05T12:29:10.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unable to connect -_-","replies":[]},{"poster":"Christolaki","date":"2015-03-05T12:21:17.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's very odd how when I played yesterday, I had a ping of 45-50... now this isn't what I usually get and I was really surprised that it 'went back' to this ping. A couple months ago (I think it was when the new summoners rift was put in) My ping jumped from my average 40-50 ping, all the way to 79-90 ping. Now for me, that was quite stressing because I casually lag here and it put me on tilt for quite awhile because it was practically twice the amount I usually played on. The only reason my ping spikes is because of the exchange in our area needs to be fixed, and for some reason whenever someone uploads/uses too much of the bandwidth up, the ping spikes up.\n\nSo when I played a game today, I was sadly surprised to see my ping back to 79-90.. so whatever you guys did last night, it was good.. make it go back to how it was... ; ;\n\nIf there's anyone who knows how they could fix my problem and somehow make it go back to what it was doing yesterday, then please help me!
