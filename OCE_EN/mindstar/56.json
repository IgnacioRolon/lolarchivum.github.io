How do you reallocate traffic in the event of one of them failing?","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2018-01-11T22:12:15.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Essentially it is all pretty automatic, because the internet in general is pretty good at routing around a link failure.  Routers all over the world use [BGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol) to advertise their existence, and collectively build out a map of how to get around the world.   When a link goes dead, a router can use this map to figure out the next best way to send traffic.\n\nWhat happens in a case like last night is that a link might \"flap\" - going up and down repeatedly, and this can cause instability (because traffic keeps changing directions).  In this case we go in and manually turn off that link - at least until we've spoken to whoever is on the other end of it (usually an ISP or Peering Exchange), and we're confident that any problems have been solved.\n\nCheers!\nMindstar","replies":[]}]}]}]}
