While we are working on this, League of Legends will be unavailable for up to two hours.\n\nPlease accept our apologies for the short notice.\n\nEDIT: As of 10:30 AEDT, we completed the maintenance.  All systems should be back to normal.\n\n-Mindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Nekonatic","date":"2014-12-17T23:09:00.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what happened to the hardware?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-17T23:47:46.102+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the depths of the pitch-black night, a spectre from the Shadow Isles decided to give Rito Waddaheadbroquarters a visit. It ventured its way through the abandoned corridors, tendrils of it's striking figure wrapping around the floor behind it. The hardware room is what it seeked, and that is exactly what it found.\n\nThe spectre moved closer to the vital piece of hardware, reaching out with its severed limb to touch it. The hardware shivered under the spectre's touch, yet it remained strong. Then, the spectre gave it a soothing stroke of passion, and the hardware combusted into ten trillion pieces! Aghast, the spectre shrieked back and hollered \"OH, WHAT A TRAVESTY I HATH COMMITED; A PUNISHMENT SUITABLE FOR THIS CRIME HATH NOT EVEN BEEN INVENTED YET!\" and then quickly slithered away back into the blackness of the night.\n\nRito employee Agent Mindstar detected a disturbance in the League waves. Rising up from meditating in his mansion, he swiftly grabbed his uniform and ran to the Rito Waddaheadbroquarters. Upon his arrival, he found that the corridors were strewn with dark tendrils of unspeakable horror, leading him towards a specific room. Follow the trails he did, until he found the scene. In the hardware room, where the machines created the magic to sustain twelve thousand instances of Summoner's Drift (Beta) at the same time were held, had asploded.\n\nIn every corner of the room, parts of the hardware were tossed everywhere. A bit of metal twisted here, some screws lying about over there; it was truly an upsetting thing to observe. Agent Mindstar immediately called this to the attention of our Lord and Saviour, Rito Phreak, and on this terrible occurrence of he deemed that \"None shall play League on this faithful morning, so that respects shall be paid to the hardware which served us well.\" With his commands set out, Rito staff from across the Waddaheadbroquarters set about disabling the availability of the sport country-wide.\n\nAnd thus is the tale of Snowdown.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2014-12-18T01:49:46.183+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow...
