Right now, our engineers are on the case and looking at possible causes.\n\nWe&#039;ve taken the precaution of disabling ranked until we&#039;re confident everything is running smoothly again.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2018-03-07T02:19:31.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update: We've narrowed the cause down to a particularly grumpy network device, and given it a small vacation from its duties.\n\nSorry for the bumpy ride this morning, we really hate it when stuff messes with the LP systems :(\n\nSee you on the rift!","replies":[{"poster":"Six Paths","date":"2018-03-07T02:28:00.725+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there another fix coming shortly?
