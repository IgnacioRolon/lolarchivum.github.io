We’ve noticed that most of the time, these channels are not being used as originally intended - often for advertising services or spamming.\r\n\r\nWhile we don’t want to remove anything for players who enjoy participating in these channels, we feel that we should not be directing new players there by listing the channels publicly.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, we’ve disabled the public channel listings for “Strategy”, “Looking For Group”, “Noob”, “Public Chat”.\r\n\r\nPlease ask below if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nAgent Mindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Noosaman","date":"2014-12-10T21:40:58.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so can i lfg on chat and how?","replies":[]},{"poster":"FASHIONISTA","date":"2014-12-03T09:48:45.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO LFG WAS MY LIFE","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2014-12-03T07:16:06.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is that spam bot still in GD chat I blocked it so I don't know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teemo Turner","date":"2014-12-03T00:29:23.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What are your plans now for the channels?","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2014-12-03T00:31:12.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The channels themselves remain - the only change is that we are removing the \"Public Channels\" listing for them.","replies":[{"poster":"Teemo Turner","date":"2014-12-03T01:44:42.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there a way to have a system in place to auto block spammers?

I have seen rioters ban people in those chats for breaching rules like elo boosting and selling accounts and some pretty inappropriate comments (which i think are the main topics of conversation/spam in the channels). It would be pretty hard to implement a auto block for this kind of thing.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Last GuardiaN","date":"2014-12-03T02:42:31.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmmm will riot remove all the channels and we only can use the Private Chat room D;","replies":[]}]}
