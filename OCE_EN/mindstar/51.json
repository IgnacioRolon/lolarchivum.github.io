This maintenance is not expected to cause any dramas, but we will disable Ranked games at the time, just to be certain.\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s what you need to know:\r\n\r\n * Ranked Queues will go down at 10:30pm AEST (3rd Oct)\r\n * Maintenance will start at approximately midnight\r\n * We expect it to last approximately 5 hours.\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ll bring Ranked back online as soon as maintenance is complete and we&#039;ve verified everything is stable.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Puz","date":"2018-10-03T12:34:36.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Are you guys thick?

Unfortunately for this particular work, the regions affected spanned everything from Australia to New York, and we have to take into account players from so many places.\n\nEG in this case we had:\n\n * AEST / SYDNEY: 10:30pm ranked off, for maintenance until ***5am***\n * EST / New York: 8:30am ranked off, for maintenance lasting until ***3pm***\n\nNow, while you could say that its worse to have it start at 10:30pm, what is also factored in is the duration of the maintenance, and the possibility for ongoing problems as a result.  Because of this, moving it any later could put the afternoon in NA at risk.\n\nI hope this helps explain it a little.  If you have any questions let me know!\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Samueljlim18","date":"2018-10-03T14:28:47.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What Kind?
