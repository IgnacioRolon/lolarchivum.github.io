We've disabled loss prevention and enabled ranked once more.   Good luck out there!\n\n**Update - 10:15am AEST**\nIt looks like the cause of this is a network link that failed between our datacentres, preventing game servers from talking to our platform.  We're working on restoring connectivity and we should have everything up and running again shortly.\n\n**Original Post**\n\nWe&#039;re aware of some server issues that may be impacting your ability to start / connect to games. We&#039;ve disabled ranked as a precaution, and we are looking into it. I&#039;ll post updates as soon as I have them.\n\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"lordofrage","date":"2016-01-28T01:21:24.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol  [RESOLVED] Server Issues - 28th Jan 2015 its 2015 boys","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-01-28T01:26:00.864+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have no idea what you're talking about...\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Me Dig Stank","date":"2016-01-27T23:23:29.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having probs logging in . .. are people sure this is fixed??","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-01-27T23:31:29.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What kind of problems are you having logging in?
