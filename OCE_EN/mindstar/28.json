I want to clarify that this email was sent by Riot Games, and there is no reason to suspect your personal information has been passed on to an unauthorised third party.\r\n\r\nWe&rsquo;ve had a number of questions about this email via support and the boards from players concerned about their privacy, and that the email might have come from scammers.  It is really good to see that you are so vigilant about emails that seem strange, so thank you to everyone who reported it.\r\n\r\nThe email is actually a notice of a change in Privacy Policy, and is intended for players in the Brazilian region only.  Unfortunately in the process of creating and sending the email, we accidentally included the Oceania region in the process.\r\n\r\nPlease accept our apologies for any confusion or worry this caused, and thank you to those who got in touch to notify us of your concerns.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions about this.\r\n\r\nAgent Mindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Zenko Kitsune","date":"2015-10-14T07:44:08.854+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Clearly a clever ruse to swindle my personal information...
