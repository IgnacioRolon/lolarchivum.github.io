If anyone is still missing their RP, please submit a player support ticket and we will make sure you get your RP as fast as possible.\n\n**UPDATE 22/04 @ 2:00pm AEST**\n> While many players have successfully received their RP, it looks like we did miss some.  Our engineers are working to identify why this happened and fix it for everyone.\n\n\n**UPDATE 22/04 @ 9:00am AEST**\n> We've completed the rollback on the store visual update, and we've also given out RP for the missed transactions.\n> Please take a look and confirm you have received your RP now.\n\n\n\n\n\n**UPDATE 21/04 @ 4:00pm AEST**  \n> We've identified the cause of the issue, and will be rolling back the visual update tomorrow once we have fully verified the fix.   Redeeming pre-purchased/gift cards for RP will remain disabled until then.\n> \n> We'll also be finalizing all missed transactions at that stage, so if you have redeemed a code in the last 24 hours and not received RP, it will be delivered shortly afterwards.\n\n**ORIGINAL POST**\n> Hi folks,\n> \n> We&#039;re aware of a problem that is causing players to be unable to successfully redeem RP gift cards.
