During this outage players will be unable to access the updated client alpha. At this time we do not have an estimate for when the client will be available but we&#039;ll be sure to keep you all updated as the issue develops.\r\n\r\nThanks for testing!\r\n\r\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-08-26T00:06:27.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LCU is back online!\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]}]}
