We&#039;re looking into it at present and will update here when we have more information.\n\n\n**Final Update** - 7th Nov @ 8am\nIt looks like the actions mentioned in the previous update did resolve the issue and we're back into smooth sailing. I'll post up a bit more detail next week, once we've had a chance to go over the timeline of what happened in full.\n\nPlease accept my apologies for the bumpy Friday night!\n\nBest  Regards\nMindstar\n\n\n**Previous Updates // Timeline**\n\n**Update 7th Nov @ 1:15am**\nMigrating the service mentioned earlier did not work, but it helped us identify a network device, which was causing intermittent network disruptions on some key internal traffic.\n\nWe've been monitoring things for around 30 minutes now and are not seeing any signs of the original connection issue occurring.  We'll keep watching closely for the next few hours in case of further issues.\n\n**Update 7th Nov @ 12:15am**\nWe think we've isolated a service within the LoL platform that is not performing 100% correctly, and preventing a small number of games from starting/finishing correctly. Right now we're working to take it offline and migrate its job over to a back server. Once this is done we'll be monitoring to see if it addresses the issue.\n\n**Update @ 10:15pm**\nWe're still troubleshooting the issue.  We're going through a process of elimination as we narrow down possible causes for this issue, but we're not there just yet.  Please bear with us and we'll have everything back up and running as soon as we can.\n\n**Update @ 8:15pm**\nWe're still seeing the issues and have a team of engineers working to identify root cause.  We haven't yet got an ETA on a fix but will keep you updated with more info when we have it.\n\n\n\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-11-06T20:59:08.138+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Update 7th Nov @ 8am**\nIt looks like the actions mentioned in the previous update did resolve the issue and we're back into smooth sailing.
