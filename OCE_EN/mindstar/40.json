Loss prevented was enabled as a precaution during the change window, and has since been disabled again.\n\n\n~~~\n\nHi all,\n\nTonight we&#039;ll be performing a brief network maintenance to remove one of our peering partners at 1am AEDT.  Players on iiNet, Spark, Dodo, iPrimus and potentially other ISPs are likely to experience a brief disconnect from games in progress around that time.\n\nThis is a follow-up from last nights issues, and will allow the partner to perform maintenance to their network to prevent it happening in the future.\n\nPlease keep an eye on this thread and the server status page for any updates.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Saythes","date":"2016-04-01T10:12:59.856+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Urf confirmed","replies":[{"poster":"Horizonn","date":"2016-04-01T11:53:14.408+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Please","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tysius","date":"2016-04-01T13:28:23.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It better be.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"meeoow","date":"2016-04-01T14:07:59.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah any idea how long ranked will be disabled for?","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-04-01T14:21:19.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Should be back online now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vüla","date":"2016-04-01T13:27:11.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If one is in game will players experience lag?\n{{summoner:3}}","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-04-01T13:53:09.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might get briefly disconnected from game when the changes are made.","replies":[{"poster":"BreeZy2EaSy","date":"2016-04-01T14:16:02.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just played  a game and only got 8lp","replies":[{"poster":"MoNtell","date":"2016-04-01T14:18:32.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same goes 9lp for a win got anything to do with this?\n{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-04-01T14:20:20.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does.
