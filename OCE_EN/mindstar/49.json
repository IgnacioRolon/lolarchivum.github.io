This shouldn't have caused a huge issue (we have multiple connections in place), but for some reason it caused some knock-on problems to our game server networking while that link was down.  As a result, games in progress were affected and new games did not start for around 20 minutes (the duration of the outage).  Loss forgiven was enabled while this was all happening.  \r\n\r\nOnce the affected link came back online, we were able to get the game servers up and running and everything working normally again.\r\n\r\nWhile this was related to a third-party outage, we'll be spending time this week looking over exactly what happened and why it affected our network so heavily.  We'll be looking to make improvements to our set-up to prevent against this in the future.\r\n\r\nSee you on the rift!\r\n\r\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Shyama","date":"2015-02-25T00:02:36.285+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the *update*!","replies":[]},{"poster":"francisco2016","date":"2016-02-25T23:10:38.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm still having problems. Today when i started the game he starts patching. I start the game and played a nice one game. Then all games start getting crazy. I was playing against bots with garen and for example (i used garen's ulti twice in a row - no cooldown) and then after that i give commands and the time of response was very low. I give a command and takes like 60sec. to actually do it and sometimes it doesn't at all.
