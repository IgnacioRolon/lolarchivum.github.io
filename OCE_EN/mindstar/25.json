This is intended to make it a bit more reliable in the time it takes to appear, but we'd love to know if, starting from now, you see a delay (eg. 15 - 30 seconds) waiting for this information.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Viagra","date":"2016-08-30T11:27:54.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sometime my stat not show :( sad pepe","replies":[]},{"poster":"Madly Outplayed","date":"2015-02-12T04:52:25.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks works fine{{item:2050}}","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Cochese","date":"2015-02-12T13:20:47.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great to hear, thanks for reporting back to us.
