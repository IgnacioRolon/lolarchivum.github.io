Lack of communication with non-english speaking team mates in an english server","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lately I have noticed a large increase in non-english speaking team mates, (in-particular seems to be asian orientented team mates).\r\n\r\nNow this shouldn&#039;t be a problem usually due to the ping system in the game, but sometimes you need to communicate with your team mates via the chat. For example, you make a call saying you&#039;re going to split push top and type in the chat for your team to not engage as you won&#039;t be there, but, they don&#039;t understand a single thing you&#039;ve said ending up in them fighting a 4v5 and you losing multiple objectives off of this.\r\n\r\nThese players who don&#039;t speak/understand english are not able to communicate their thoughts, and in some cases I&#039;ve been on the opposite end of this in which my whole team has been speaking in another language and I end up not knowing their calls and get flamed due to that.\r\n\r\nNow I&#039;m not saying they shouldn&#039;t be allowed on this server purely because of this fact (everyone should have the right to play on whatever  server they wish), but maybe there should be a post and encouragement for these people to join a server in which they will be able to communicate effectively with their team, in their home native language, and therefore increase the teams chance for success.\r\n\r\nPlease no flaming :) (this is in no way shape or form a hate/racist discussion).","replies":[{"poster":"Oman2","date":"2015-09-18T09:19:42.240+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why doesn't Riot make a translation for the team chat? It can't be that hard right? However hard it is, it would solve all problems people are talking about, you could play on any server and even if the translations were dodgy, you could still have basic communication.","replies":[{"poster":"Mark of Kindred","date":"2015-09-18T09:28:20.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love that idea!

That's why you almost always see those who simply either doesn't know or care about typing English and/or pinging at late night, because they most likely are not playing here regionally but from overseas for whatever reason.\n\nThe players from overseas can get a bit obnoxious sometimes, because some of them think we can't read what he is typing and goes around insulting people, when a great deal of us can perfectly read and understand wtf he is talking about, leading to a flame war.\n\nI don't think OCE should get a region lock because the poor souls in SEA, Japan, India or middle east still wanna play games too, yet they don't really have anywhere to go so some of them would end up here.\n\nDunno how we can get people stay in their region though, it's a better experience for them anyway why go play on another server hundreds of miles away?","replies":[{"poster":"Mark of Kindred","date":"2015-09-18T08:08:31.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand completely what you are saying and agree 100% with that. I too agree that there shouldn't be a region lock, although I think Riot should possibly look into doing a bit more to either create new servers for these people (obviously the more expensive option!) or encourage them more towards other servers where the possibility of communication is more likely. \n\nAbout 5 minutes before writing this comment I was in a normals game with a party who were obviously from an asian location, and boy I tell you it was not a pleasant experience!\n\n10 minutes into the game the insulting commenced and I was astounded at the racial abuse i was receiving! I find this occurs far too often for my liking and has began to turn me away from this server/game all together!\n\nTook a screenshot of the chat and will be sending in a ticket.

The Support seems to be dealing more with technical aspect of the game now, and less on behaviours as far as I know.","replies":[{"poster":"Mark of Kindred","date":"2015-09-18T08:46:34.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can attest to that too!

If you're playing on say the OCE server while you actually live somewhere else like say China or Germany. You are deliberately handicapping yourself. You have your OWN regional server. You have no reason at all to play on a server on the other side of the world.\nYou know you're screwing yourself and your team mates over if you deliberately play on another server like that.\n\nFor this we need a region lock out system.\nI know there are instances where like a Youtuber will play with another Youtuber from say NA and EU. But they are quite the minority compared to people who just don't give two shits.","replies":[{"poster":"Mark of Kindred","date":"2015-09-18T06:05:49.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely agree with the first part said there. Have had multiple instances that look similar to the ones listed. \n\nHowever instead of a lockout, perhaps more of an incentive from Riot to promote people to play in the server closest to their location, which would solve the communication issue to a certain extent and also eliminate that handicap you talked about.\n\nThanks for your input! :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-09-19T05:14:06.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"A serious problem is having a leg fall off.
