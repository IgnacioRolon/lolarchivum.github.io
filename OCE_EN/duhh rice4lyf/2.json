I have around 75 wins but then, going against players with 100-200+ wins is quite unfair to me. I just hate the fact that I&#039;m being placed with high Elo players and also ranked. I&#039;m also getting blamed for feeding and how horrible I am which caused the team to lose. Has anything like this happened to anyone else?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-05-15T00:15:13.052+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being placed with High Elo players is SO SO SO much better than being placed with Low Elo ones..... trust me on this..\n\nAt least in your situation, all you need to do is worry about your own playing You don't have to do well, just work on not feeding, pick high CC champs/tanks and just be a meat-shield/CC-Machine for your team.\n\nBeing placed with Low Elo players, you have to worry about not only your own playing, but 4 other people as well! and thats a lot harder to fix! EVERYONE wants to be Zed/Fizz etc etc. so your team ends up with no tanks and 3 AD assassins... and feeds... AND still rages you even though you are the one actually doing something. \n\nSo yea... what i wouldn't give to be placed with High Elo players..","replies":[{"poster":"xLightRFT","date":"2016-05-15T03:46:09.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nailed it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2016-05-15T04:42:31.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone that spent all of season 5 in b5 and currently in promos to b3 i wouldn't be complaining bro!","replies":[]}]}
