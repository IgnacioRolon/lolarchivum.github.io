I can't speak to the actual reasons why it's not an explicit option when submitting a ticket; however, I imagine that Riot wants players to predominantly utilise the in-game report system, allowing for the automated systems to function more efficiently and reduce the load on the Player Support Specialists.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-06-18T17:01:27.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can tell you why, and it's because riot don't give a fuck.\n\nSeriously the fact that it needs to be redirected to people who actually do player behaviour due to their not being an option shows this.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2016-06-18T21:24:57.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot hasn't given a single fk about what the community thinks since the game came out!\n\nThe only way to make these fkers listn is to stop playing the game!\n\nBy then it will be too late! \n\nGG to stupid companies!","replies":[{"poster":"Sasataf","date":"2016-06-20T01:15:02.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well you can just find another free game to play man.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"octa kill","date":"2016-06-18T15:03:14.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol... lucians first game as adc, and eves first evelynn game haha! \ni hope riot ban them...\n\nirelion sol with the 19/20 winrate running that comp... abit sus dont you think RIOT?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-06-18T15:04:54.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They won't, because they don't care, and hell they enabled this shit.\n\nAll to try and make room for the casuals, because there is more money to be had from the casuals, and honestly, those casuals are probably the one buying boosts.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-06-18T23:50:33.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dynamic que, playing with \"friends\".","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"i am flawless","date":"2016-06-18T15:04:49.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't get more obvious then that... all the accounts associated with that ip should just get perma banned","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-06-18T15:08:19.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh hey!
