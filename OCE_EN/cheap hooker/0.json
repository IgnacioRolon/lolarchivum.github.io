I played a ranked game and won and i was still unable to see my LP/rank on my profile. I then played another game straight afterwards and lost that game, I can now see my LP/rank on my profile but i lost the LP and did not gain any from the game i played before. Hard enough to climb with the community on here let alone when you can&#039;t even reward a player for winning a game but you can deduct points for losing one. Sort it out.\n\n\nWill we be given back the league points we deserve? demoted because your servers aren't actually registering wether or not we win a game is pretty stupid in my oppinion.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-30T06:19:52.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Agent Mindstar,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=IZhaZ5cs,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-03-30T03:41:28.427+0000)\n>\n> Hey,\n> \n> We had an [issue after the maintenance](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/VKveAt3y-complete-scheduled-maintenance-30032016?comment=0007) where LP was not being recorded.
