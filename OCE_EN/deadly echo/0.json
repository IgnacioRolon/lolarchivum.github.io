Please visit support.leagueoflegends.com for more information.\"_\r\n\r\nSo to my initial confusion I tried to log in thinking well maybe I acted negative towards someone and received a suspension due to the in game chat logs. I tried to log in and couldn't do so, I was simply shown the same pop up message as before. Even more confused than before I thought hmm maybe I have an email from Riot. Alas I did have an email, though... it said this:\r\n\r\n_\"Greetings deadlyecho,\r\n\r\nActions that have been performed on your account are in violation of the League of Legends Terms of Use. You can review these terms at *link*\r\n\r\nDue to the severity of this violation your League of Legends account has been banned until Mon Oct 23 00:00:00 UTC 2017\r\n\r\nIf you have any question, contact our Player Support team at *link*\r\n\r\nRiot Games Player Support\"_\r\n\r\nNow I have 2 different points of contact from Riot both with no information whatsoever. I have submitted a ticket to see what's going on but what I'm curious about are things such as:\r\n\r\n- Has anyone else been through something similar?\r\n- Why is there no \"reason\" or given evidence.\r\n- Why send me an email saying I've violated the LoL ToU but not say what the violation is?\r\n- Do I now lose out on rewards? \r\n- Is it possible to have this suspension lifted?\r\n- What possible causes are there to warrant a suspension in this manner?\r\n\r\nI played 2 games today, both with 0 toxicity, 0 flame, 0 negativity, 0 salt. 1 4v5 flex game that we won and 1 solo queue game where I had another awesome team and we won... haven't played in 2 or 3 days and suddenly i'm suspended :3\r\n\r\nThank for reading","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2017-10-10T07:05:39.053+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've been working on a system that involves looking through champ select and post-game chats looking for instances of verbal abuse or unsportsmanlike behaviour.\n\nWe've been trialing this system during the last week.
