I'm quite calm, I have a really mellow personality and I don't like raging or negativity in communication.   If you can laugh about the misplays and opening admit to fucking up then we'll get along well.  I'm really open to constructive criticism as I see LoL skill as a craft and I enjoy developing my abilities.  \n\nI haven't really mained a lane.  I duo'd my Gold 5 placements with my high plat roomate.  We alternated playing mid/top and won 9/10.  Then I started Uni and never touched that account for months.  My silver has been going since s3 and I played from B4 to S1 in a month, just filled any position.  This was after Uni finished then again quit playing.   I'm a bit irregular with playing the game, i'd go hard for a couple months then focus on shit IRL for a bit.  But I'm keen to knuckle down for S6 as I want platinum by March.\n\nIf I find a decent duo partner I want to grow in my consistency with Top and Jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"OzRoy","date":"2015-11-28T11:40:27.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"we can play a few and see how it goes if you want , if our personality clash well not much you can do but will never know till we try","replies":[]}]}]}
