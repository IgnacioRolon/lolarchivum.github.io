The other way is think how op you will look when you carry this guy to victory. Easier said then done i know. I have have been rewarded by riot a few times now. have gotten skins and icons from them oh and free rp and ip so. just think of that. It's really hard I know with all the trolls out there. tearing off someones head is not going to make them a better player. It's just going to make them rage at you and then they play worse then you rage and round it goes.  You would be surprised how close i have come to loosing but didn't because I didn't rage. Doing the same thing and expecting a different outcome is just silly. As all lanes top bot and mid I wander around every now and then and gank that lane that is having a bit of trouble it makes life easier for you and the lane you ganked. All fed champs have a weakness and if you get on it early you can avoid the rage. Just be mindful of your other players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Istehz","date":"2015-01-30T03:24:02.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mute everyone in-game so even if you do be toxic you can't see what they're saying and you won't need to keep replying to them.","replies":[{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-01-31T06:02:56.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Istezz,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=k37vXETK,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-30T03:24:02.083+0000)\n>\n> Mute everyone in-game so even if you do be toxic you can't see what they're saying and you won't need to keep replying to them.\n\nyup\n\n\nat the start of the game \n\n/mute all","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-01-30T04:42:39.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just remember it is one game, that is, it is not indicative of a persons total capabilities. \n\nOne person may go 1/13/1 and flame all game even at his teammates that are not responding to him and who are 7/4/6.\n\nHe may just be having a bad time or he misplayed that lane and has gone on tilt. In the Previous games he has gone 22/8/17 and carried his team (or was carried to the point where he had impact, as most vayne players are)\n\n\n\n* Muting is a good thing i agree.\n\n* Just dont tell that person that he is bad, if he is 1/9 he probably knows he isnt playing good, would you want him to play worse by telling him hes bad?\n\n* Just learn to ignore people, if you are spending time in chat/all chat berating someone, you obviously arnt doing enough carrying. Instead of wasting time on flaming, say to yourself, \"Ok, my teammate is doing REALLY BAD, i need to play REALLY GOOD, to balance it out\", at which point you put all thought and dedication into farming hard and getting ahead. \n* Think about making SMART plays. Tell your laner thats going bad to only engage when he knows its 100% Guaranteed a kill or smart play.  (None of this, \"im 0/5 but this guy whos farmed better than me and on 1/2HP is free gold, DESPITE not seeing the rest of his team on the map i will still go in.\" only to be jumped as you go 1v1 into a 1v3 ambush.)\n* THINK ABOUT THINKING WHAT PLAYS THE ENEMY WILL MAKE. Relay this to your team instead of relaying Flame. If the person going bad knows that a play is going to be made, they will think differently and play safer resulting in less deaths and hopefully making a comeback.\n* Remember, you are Toxic if your intentions are to belittle others REGARDLESS of how they are being flamed. You can stop being toxic by not talking down on someone. Try putting \"STOP %%%%ING FEEDING\" into more friendly words such as \"Vayne, please stop trying to fight when you only have vision of one person, the rest of the enemy team could be waiting to bait you. We should buy wards so that we can play safe in our Vision.\"\n\nIf there is one thing i would say to you that would help you stop being \"Toxic\", is that just dont respond to negativity that is not genuine critique. And Negativity is not just words.","replies":[{"poster":"OzRoy","date":"2015-01-30T05:54:44.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You last dot point i think will be the most usefull","replies":[]}]}]}
