If someone wants to gift you something they cn just look a tyour wishlist and see what things you want. Maybe have a maximum if 5 things on it and have the 1st thing show up when you hover over a summoner on the friends list on the side. If this could be added that would be great and would also serve as a place to quickly buy something you want instead of having to go into the store to buy it.
