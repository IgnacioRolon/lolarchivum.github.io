My client seems to freeze and I cannot do anything for anywhere between 5- 1 min. It really disrupts the flow of the client and is really annoying when it is happening every few seconds. I&#039;ve tried a repair of the client and a re-install however neither worked.\r\n\r\n2. My boards profile picture doesn&#039;t update when I change my summoner icon in the game client. Currently I have the Cloud9 LCS summoner icon (although I want the Fnatic one) but for some reason the PROJECT: Lucian summoner icon shows up on the boards which is the one I had previously. It&#039;s been like this for 3 weeks and it&#039;s starting to get annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-06-04T00:57:54.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\n1) When you say your client is \"Freezing\" for a period of time, do you mean in-game or are you referring to the actual pvp.net client?\n\n2) Would you look at that, it seems your summoner icon has updated :) Did you ever end up submitting that ticket [I suggested](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/26yUZRvT-profile-picture-on-boards-profile-bugged?comment=000000000000) in your other thread?","replies":[{"poster":"BurningAvalanche","date":"2016-06-04T02:03:05.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Time to spice things up\n\n2.
