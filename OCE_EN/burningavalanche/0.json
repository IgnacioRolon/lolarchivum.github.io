I just played a game with someone who created an extremely negative environment in my game so I reported him but I don&#039;t know if the rest of my team did. I feel like this player deserves to get atleast a suspension from the game because his/her actions would still be present with a chat ban and he needs to get the message that every other champion is another human being. So I want to know how the tribunal thing works like if it goes through a list of reported players and goes through them or if it ranks people based on how many reports they got.

So naturally there's always confusion around this.\n\nAnyway, here's a simple explanation of how the Instant Feedback system works: (Adapted from [this](https://lol.garena.com/news/general/improving-player-behaviour-2-%E2%80%93-instant-feedback). ))\n\n> When you report someone, the Instant Feedback system will check their chat logs for evidence of toxic behaviour. \n> \n>  Then either 2 things will happen:\n> \n> \n> +     _If there's no evidence of them being toxic, then nothing happens._ \n> \n>  If the evidence isn't there, then more reports will lead to the same outcome. The system needs evidence to punish.\n> \n> \n> +     _If they were toxic, then they'll be punished._ \n> \n>  More reports after this won't trigger extra punishment. But they're used by the system in [other ways](http://pages.citebite.com/k5h5o9v7k1eun).\n> \n\nWe can't really predict how the system will judge your specific case, but from what you've said it looks like he'll be punished.\n\nHowever, if it is someone's first minor offence and they had a positive history up to then, the system might give them a pass. **Lyte** talks a bit about this[ here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/yFLxpAcV-qa-about-player-behavior-systems-chat-log-reviews-and-feedback?comment=005d0000).\n\nI hope that helps :D","replies":[{"poster":"Revelstoke","date":"2016-12-10T05:25:04.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Right, so reading the OP, as this person says \n\n\"his/her actions would still be present with a chat ban \"\n\nIE, this person was ACTING Poorly, aka  troll, so \n\" Instant Feedback system will check their chat logs \" \nand wont find any so called evidence.\n\nBasically, there is no detection in place for trolling, riot has\ndone nothing on the problem of people with toxic in-game play (vs chat)\ndon't acknowledge it beyond saying its hard to fix (cough cough, 4 years ago)\n\nYou could try lodging a ticket, however I don't believe they look at them\nanymore from what I've read on the forums.\n\nWelcome to the cesspool, dont expect it to get any better.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-10T11:22:51.603+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh thanks for pointing this out. I didn't notice this was actually about gameplay toxicity not chat toxicity. Sorry about that ahah :D\n\n__*\n\nI think you've misunderstood quite a bit about the gameplay toxicity stuff though. I'll try clear that up now: \n\n+ There is a system in place for [intentional feeding](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/oH6zB1eg-detecting-and-banning-extreme-intentional-feeders?show=flat), and people who get detected by it are punished through the Instant Feedback system. \n\n It works really well for standard intentional feeding, especially if the behaviour is consistent. For example, 2/18/4 Jinx or 0/12/1 Ezreal.\n\nBut you are correct that the intentional feeding detection system isn't so good at detecting **subtle** feeding/trolling. For example, 'playing normally most of the game and then randomly running it down mid twice'. **Lyte** talks a bit about this [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/yFLxpAcV-qa-about-player-behavior-systems-chat-log-reviews-and-feedback?comment=00080000).\n\n**_That doesn't mean that these players will not be banned though_,** these players will still be caught in manual reviews. The only downside is that it may take a lot of reports before they get punished. [Here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/sU5wOfFJ-proof-that-the-automated-system-is-broken)'s an example of someone being caught by a manual review.\n\nAlso where did you read that Riot doesn't look at report tickets anymore? All my Riot Support contacts say they do look at report tickets if they are legible and have evidence/information.\n\nI hope that helped :)","replies":[{"poster":"Revelstoke","date":"2016-12-10T12:04:31.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh yes, IF Detection is legit, its not very good... but it exists and is automated.\n\nTrolling though, the \"manual\" process, yeah, lets be real, \n\n\"The only downside is that it may take a lot of reports before they get punished. \"\n\nThere is no may in that sentence. - http://prnt.sc/96oiu8\n\nThis is my favorite, 70 games of full tilt, tahm kench, eat your team mates and spit them to their death\ntrolling.

But the system's been [upgraded](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/i5yNt3I5-upgrading-the-intentional-feeder-detection-system?show=flat) and tweaked a few times since then. Also a report sent to Riot Support of feeding even 1/4 of that would undoubtedly result in a perma-ban. I would be extremely surprised if there was a more recent case of this happening to the same scale.\n\nEither way, as with any system there will always be mistakes and things that slip through. No one here is claiming the system is perfect, but things like _\"its not very good\"_ or _\"riot has done nothing on the problem of people with toxic in-game play\"_ is simply not true. \n\nRiot has the most advanced feeding detection system out of any video game ever.

Instead I can explain why I think that way with a few examples:\n\n+ The DoTA 2 detection system is simply based off the **number of reports you receive**. While League's system has automated systems to check the validity of reports. And in our case just one report is enough for the system to investigate someone and ban them (if they are guilty), but in DoTA 2 this is not possible.\n\n Here's a few quotes and sources for that; _\"When one recives the high number of Intentional feeding or Ability abuse reports he will be sent to lPQ (Low Priority Queue) due to [Excessive number of reports](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/581323629913308207/6B01925FEB6674C2F80F534B8CD56D339D6992E4/)\"_. [Source for quote.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/54gfqi/report_system_account_flagging_and_its_flaws/)\n\n The punishment system is also severely flawed. Intentionally feeding will not land you a permanent ban ever, just many LPQ matches. [Source](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Report) and [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5he55h/intentional_feeding_needs_to_have_a_stronger/).\n\n\n+ CS:GO's [Overwatch punishment system](http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/overwatch/) is really awesome, but in many ways our system does the same thing + more.\n\n CS:GO does not have a automatic detection system for feeding (or as they call it \"griefing\"). This means detection must always be done by a real person in the Overwatch system, which is slow. Also since there are more reports than Overwatch participants, the only [players reviewed](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7562-IPJN-1009#review) are those which have received many reports. \n\n On the other hand our Instant Feedback system (which handles feeding and chat bans) works [within 15 minutes](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-#h1q2) of a game ending and reviews EVERY report.\n\n The Overwatch system can also detect 'nuanced' feeding, because it's reviewed by real humans. Our automated system can't do this, **but our manual review system can**. \n\n Our manual review system seems very similar to the Overwatch system, but to be fair I think the Overwatch system is probably a little better and faster, in nuanced feeding cases (as it has more people reviewing reports). But don't forget we would far outpace it in standard non-nuanced cases that are handled by the automatic system.\n\nSuper long explanation, but that's why I think we've got the best system out. To this day I haven't seen a better overall behaviour system for a large multiplayer game. \n\nNo other game has something this advanced. It's especially impressive when you consider our disadvantages too. For example, CS:GO has shorter matches so the [Overwatch system's cases only take 10 minutes to review](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7562-IPJN-1009#howwork). But our matches have an average length of 20 - 45 minutes.\n\n__*\n\n> Just FYI, your chronology is off, Lyte posted about the upgrade 6/11/2015\nthe first game in the trolls history is 10/11/2015\n\nYour dates are correct, but this system was live ONLY on NA the day it was posted (6/11/2015), if you read the post carefully you'll see **Lyte** mentions this. Then I believe around 3 days later it was added on EUW and even later still on EUNE (where the Tahm incident occurred) and other servers. \n\nSadly **Lyte** forgot to update us on those other times, but having a gap of over a month between the testing and live release is very reasonable and has occurred with almost all other systems in the past.\n\nEven if the new system was operational on EUNE when the Tahm was feeding, I think it's fair to allow for some issues within the first few weeks while they make adjustments. And as I said before, stuff does slip by, no system is perfect.\n\n__*\n\n> There's no system to detect the guy who follows\nme around as a jungler doing his best to steal my jungle farm and not covering\nhis lane.\n\nYou keep saying this, but I've told you multiple times that a **manual review system** is in place for these behaviors. If evidence is the problem I can link plenty.\n\n**Lyte** says _\"These more nuanced behaviors will require more research and advanced machine learning to tease apart, and **are being punished by Rioter manual reviews today.**\"_\n\nOR [this](http://support.lol.garena.com/en_SG/articles/442) Garena support article specifically about their manual review system.\n\nOR **Riot Tantram** telling people they were punished by a manual review on multiple occasions [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/MIBGEN1J-the-issue-with-the-behaviour-system-is-that-it-is-too-black-and-white?comment=000500020000), [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/axT0mNKk-riot-admitted-to-inappropriately-suspending-my-account?comment=000000000000000000000000000000000000) and [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/axT0mNKk-riot-admitted-to-inappropriately-suspending-my-account?comment=0002).\n\n___*\n\nAlso I'm not sure who's disliking your posts but please stop ahah XD \n\nHe's making a real effort to learn more about the system, I would be overjoyed if most players cared even half as much.","replies":[{"poster":"Revelstoke","date":"2016-12-13T02:35:45.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TLDR; Thank you for your responses, its been a good conversation!\n            Looks like I'll have some reading material for the next few days :)\n\n\nI've personally got a very up and down relationship with league, based off \nplaying for a while, running into a series of clever or \"subtle\" trolls in game\nand then throwing in the towel, most recently I came back because of\nenjoying watching worlds. \n\nI have been notified of automated ban's and I have seen people punished \nusing the manual process.
