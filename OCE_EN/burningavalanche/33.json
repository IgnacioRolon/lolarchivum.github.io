I find that I am an emotional player meaning that if i&#039;m winning i&#039;m really happy and if i&#039;m losing I&#039;m annoyed, angry or sad. It&#039;s high highs and low lows and this tends to happen in any competitive thing I partake in that I care about a lot. So i need a way to try and not be so much of a nuisance to my team when I am losing. Any help will be appreciated. Especially detailed responses. :)","replies":[{"poster":"BurningAvalanche","date":"2017-04-28T06:46:54.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will try out both things in my next few games, thank you guys for helping. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-27T11:54:34.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tele pretty much nailed it.\nIt can help to say those decisions out loud _(it makes it less weird if you're playing with some else of course)_ as hearing the command can solidify it in your own mind.\n\nBut what is also important is actually breathing!\nMedium length, steady breaths, through your nose. \nFeel the air come into your stomach area _(lower lungs)_ rather than just in your mouth and out again. \nToo shallow and it can make you anxious, too deep and you start sounding like Darth Vader and too much of your attention goes to forcing your breathing. Just breathe steadily and feel your diaphram pushing down gently on your stomach _(thats how you know the right amount)_.\nThis regulates you, it calms you down when you're too exited, and it focuses you when you are down in the dumps.\n\nSighing can help, its a way the body releases tension. _(I mean an exhale sigh, not a sigh of annoyance. sigh with your lungs, not your mouth,)_\nIf a teamfight goes bad, stop, sigh, take a second to imagine the tension leaving. Analyse what went wrong, figure out how to fix it, then put the fight out of your mind.\n\nRemember that getting a pentakill or other extremely awesome event can screw you up just as much as a teamfight gone wrong.\nTake a second, enjoy the feeling, then let it go. Breathe.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-04-27T10:19:20.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right, it's not not good to be \"sad\", but being \"happy\" isn't great either IMO. That's usually when players get cocky and throw games. \n\nI find I the best mentality to be in is a _focused_ one. When you get in a focused mentality it's not about _\"will we win or loose?\"_, it's about _\"what is the best course of action right now?\"_ right up until when the nexus explodes.\n\nWhat really helps me get into a focused mindset is to pretend I'm streaming or shot-calling for a team. For example, I'll run through every decision mentally:\n\n+ _\"Ashe is one level up on me, I'll wait for Thresh before I trade\"_\n+ _\"Drag in 140, I'll ping Thresh to ward there now, and I need a Control Ward on this back\"_\n+ _\"Yi is my biggest threat ATM. I'll let Thresh know he has keep an eye on my position and hook him in the next fight\"_\n\nThe other thing that can help a bit is playing some light music and/or taking the game less seriously than usual. Maybe test out a new pick or play something really really easy that doesn't require much focus.\n\nI hope that helps a bit. At the end of the day, there's no quick fix for getting overly emotional about games. It's something that you can get better at, but will probably never go away.","replies":[]}]}
