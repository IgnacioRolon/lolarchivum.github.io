Who scales better, who hits a powerspike next, and just generally being really positive and encouraging in games. Even when your teammates start tilting, doesn't mean you have to as well. By keeping a positive attitude constantly and displaying good leadership + game knowledge you will eventually get better at spreading the hype and can bring teams back from bad situations.

If you've only been playing for a month you'd be more open to comebacks as you don't fully understand the mentality low elo people have yet. Thanks a lot bro. Helps a lot :D","replies":[]}]}]}
