What is the Triforce build. From what i know it&#039;s the same as blue build; Muramana, Iceborn, ionian boots, bork, lord domonicks or mortal reminder and a defensive item but instead of iceborn it has triforce but i don&#039;t think that that is right so some clarification would be nice on that.\r\n\r\n2. What situations do you use Blue build and what situation do you use triforce build?\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-09-11T03:39:16.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Check out this site: http://www.probuilds.net/champions/details/Ezreal\n\nYou can get a good sense of the exact build path, runes and masteries that the pro players have theory crafted. It also confirms that blue build ezreal is not dead. I don't know the exact details of when you would choose one over the other but I'm sure you can figure that out after browsing the matches for a bit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-09-09T17:32:19.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bluebuild should be dead now that Iceborn has been nerfed to only be useful to Tanks/Brawlers.\nEzreal's damage suffers a lot if he takes Iceborn over Triforce too.\n\nMy typical build goes {{item:3042}} {{item:3508}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3009}} \nAnd the last item is situational depending on the needs. I rather like {{item:3033}} usually, but find that depending on enemy comp a {{item:3139}} might be needed more.\n\nMasteries I got for Thunderlords with the 45% CDR.\nRunes I play around with a fair bit depending on my mood.","replies":[{"poster":"atroquinine","date":"2016-09-11T02:53:54.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"this is an interesting build path... as for any other champ just watch what koreans build (almost always blue with fervor)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-09-09T12:04:43.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are the same, just different sheen item.
