I know the Ida isn&#039;t outstanding but it&#039;s definetly better than an A-, atleast an A+ I&#039;m sure. So I was just wondering how supports get graded.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-06-19T09:12:20.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just take kills and you will get an S+\n\nEven pros have realized that the system is fucked that way, though riot have said that it will be modified to not be based off kills so much in a coming patch","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jann√°","date":"2016-06-19T07:27:43.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In addition, less obvious things like positioning and also wards count! :) It's also compared to other thresh players, so if you did better than the average thresh in terms of KDA but not in therms of kill participation, positioning etc, then your grade will go down","replies":[]},{"poster":"traloop","date":"2016-06-19T07:19:12.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kill participation is a massive factor in your score. Yes, your KDA is great but you might have had 50 kills on your team giving you a mere kill participation score of about 30%. This shows that you weren't with your team and helping them. 1/0 is a great score with an infinite KDA but is considered bad by the system because it (again) shows you aren't helping your team.","replies":[]}]}
