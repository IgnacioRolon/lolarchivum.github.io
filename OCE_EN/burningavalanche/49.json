I know Riot said they would delay the skins to make them better and add an Azir skin for Easyhoon but it&#039;s been about 3 months since they announced them and I&#039;m really excited for them as I&#039;m a fairly big SKT fan. Just a rough release date would be appreciated. If it was from a Rioter that would be even more amazing.","replies":[{"poster":"smooth69e","date":"2016-07-20T07:10:28.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"BurningAvalanche","date":"2016-07-20T07:37:45.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's the point of saying that lmao","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2016-07-18T10:31:36.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They aren't out for the Live servers don't know when BUT saying that the pro scene has them unlocked as G2 Perkz played with the SKT Ryze skin in the mid season thing this year so soon i guess","replies":[]}]}
