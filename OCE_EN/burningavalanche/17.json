It&#039;s getting really annoying and i don&#039;t know why it&#039;s happening. It was fine last week at a constant 46-48 which is normal for me.  I&#039;m thinking it might be something to do with the update 6.19 but i&#039;m not sure. Help please.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-09-25T00:02:28.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you do the following for me;\n\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP.
