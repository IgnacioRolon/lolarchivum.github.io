She's weak because her item path isn't as flexible as many of the other adcs meaning that she has to prioritise attack speed, which isn't necessarily a good thing with the cost vs power, and the fact that shes been nerfed heavily to keep her mobility from going insane doesn't help her survive most things, especially given the huge amount of champions with dashes. A Frozen heart is all well and good to counter her with, but it shouldn't really negate her as hard as it does compared to everyone else. Even vayne still shreds people while against a frozen heart because she isn't getting doubly negated with armor and its aura.","replies":[]}]}
