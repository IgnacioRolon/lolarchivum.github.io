I know I haven&#039;t been punished in any means but I feel guilty for ruining other peoples experience of your wonderful game and I want to get this of my chest. What I said in those 2 ARAM and 1 Normal game was completely and utterly inappropriate. It was downright offensive, immature and uncalled for. I ruined the games of around 27 summoners through my own actions. I&#039;m sorry for what I have done and I hope this never happens again. Thank you for reading this Riot employees. \r\n\r\nP.S. Thanks for making Replays, Sandbox Mode, Doom Boots, the assassin rework and Mechs vs Minions. I&#039;ve had many good memories playing that game already :D.\r\n\r\nSincerely, BurningAvalanche","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-10-15T11:15:40.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It cant have been just three games, there are tons of warning before that","replies":[{"poster":"BurningAvalanche","date":"2016-10-15T11:31:57.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dragon poo,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=kgQdnTxQ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-10-15T11:15:40.319+0000)\n>\n> It cant have been just three games, there are tons of warning before that\n\nI know but those 3 games were specifically  rude and unacceptable.

You think it's all about being good and if you're not then you get stomped on and abused. A vast majority of the players who play this game play for fun. Even if they do take it seriously and intend on climbing, they still don't have a toxic attitude as bad as you'res and there hundreds of times better than you ever could be.
