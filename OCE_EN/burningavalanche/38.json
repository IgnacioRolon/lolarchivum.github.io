I think I will try out Vayne in a norm and see if I feel like I could get better at her. Thanks for letting me know what the legacy client is as well. :)\n\nP.S I played my first game of Vayne just then and went 25/7/9. I enjoyed the late game a lot and enjoyed demolishing the fed tanks. I got full build and it was really good although I made a lot of mistakes. Only an A+ though. Riot, I have my eyes on you -_-. Jokes aside thanks for letting me know what to do and I think I will continue playing Vayne :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2016-06-25T01:22:43.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the key to playing vayne is having the right mindset, you need to believe that everyone on your team is trash and that they cant help you in a team fight, you need to create your own advantages, you need to be aggressive through out the hole game. but dont go full on ape shit and feed","replies":[]}]}
