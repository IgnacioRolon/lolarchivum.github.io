Seeing as it&#039;s a 2 week suspension it&#039;s my final chance to try and reform until i get perma&#039;d. A lot of the toxicity I have is when i get really, REALLY tilted from nothing going right in the game. I hadn&#039;t had a punishment for a while then suddenly i got a 2 week suspension so I&#039;m guessing it was something big that I did from the chat logs. People say that &quot;Just follow the summoners code&quot; is the right way to go. And while in some ways true, it&#039;s a pain to read through it all, it&#039;s hard to remember those things in a heated argument or when extremely tilted. I got my ban on the first game i played today at around 5:30 (when it ended) and so it was quite a shock to see the suspension. I&#039;m sad now but I&#039;m looking to see what I can do while i wait for the agonizing 14 day wait to play league again. It&#039;s gonna be hard. :( Tell me strats i could use to not get tilted so much I think is what I need. It&#039;s not so much that I&#039;m toxic from the get go as can be seen by my chat logs (recently) where i&#039;m generally supportive and trying to create a healthy enviroment. It&#039;s rather that when nothing is going well and it&#039;s really aggravating. Send help. Also send games I can play in the meantime while I wait.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-03T14:12:49.210+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey, \n\nSorry to hear about the suspension.\nIm not exactly sure on the best ways to reform (I imagine its different for everyone), but ill can give you insight into what helps me from being toxic.\n\nIt helps to put everything into perspective.

I feel the same where you coming from that people are only emotionally attached to it because they enjoy playing it even if it's not the current game. Il try just playing norms for a bit once I get un-banned. I might find it hard to not fight back the first few days I get back so I might /mute all. Pings should be enough communication I think.

That being said, i suggest you just take a longer break from League and sort yourself out. It worked for a friend of mine who used to be toxic af. He stopped playing for over a month and shortly after he started again, he was awarded an honor badge and didn't flame in game. \n\n Also, don't bring all your s**t into the game. If you're having a bad day, don't take it out on your team or if you know you're in a bad mood just leave the computer alone.\n\nAnd try listening instead of talking so much. Just coz someone says something in chat DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE TO REACT!!! Just focus on your game even if your team is doing bad and be content with how well you played.\n\nPlaying league on a daily basis also means being exposed to all it's negativity and some people just can't help but carry into their next game, and the next and on and on which by the time they realize it, they're one of those a**holes. \n\nIf you really are on the path to being reformed, none of what i've just said should offend you at all, rather, you should be thankful in which case you're welcome. \n\nPeace.","replies":[]},{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2017-05-04T18:06:45.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Watch Tyler1 if you want to reform :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Warrior","date":"2017-05-04T02:31:24.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My Account is been reform, although it took a while i got 2 weeks ban in Nov-Dec can't remember which month exactly, But now i don't see any messages saying due to previous behaviour you are not eligible for the rewards and its been a month\n\n\nI think it will take quiet some time but also its better just not to talk anything in game else you will get banned as you know, if i need to talk something i just say in a good way <3 but deep inside i am like Fk ya bbitch kunt stop feeding \"In chat\" hey Ahri play safe under tower i will gank you and we will get revenge ^.^\n\n10 sec later ally has been slain \n\n\nFML noobs everywhere lol\n\nbut still i say in chat, guess its just a bad game all good next time Dw just a game and people honour you\n\n\nThe more honour you will get the faster you will reform\n\n\nPs: Banned 3 times in past  #experienced #must #follow #my #advice {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]}
