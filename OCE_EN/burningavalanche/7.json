I don&#039;t want to go over the price of $2000. Any help would be great. I want it to run smoothly and be able to put high or very high graphics on it in game. I will mainly only use it for League and some smaller games like csgo or other small steam games.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-09-18T12:25:22.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Build your own. You can build a beast of a machine for around $1300 that the stores would try to sell you for about $3000.\n\nI too had never done it before but luckily have a few friends who have and they helped me. It was surprisingly easy and anyone who isn't a monkey can 100% make their own.\n\nYou can look up good \"parts lists\" on PC forums and stuff. Don't know where you live, but i ordered most my parts from MSY.com. You can buy online or go to a store which is nice.\n\nIf you are 100% adamant about buying prebuilt.. http://www.msy.com.au/viconline/content/31-system-packages\n\nCheck out the \"Gaming PC 3\". Pretty good for the price. If you bought the components separately prob cost you about $1000, so they making 500 for just putting it together. Good thing about buying from a PC parts seller is you can talk to them and ask to change parts and stuff for better ones.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-18T08:19:30.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Surely you could run LoL at max specs for around half that?\nOr are you buying from a shop, rather than components online and assembling it yourself?\nCoz if you are, you're paying double.","replies":[{"poster":"BurningAvalanche","date":"2016-09-18T08:35:02.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=QAPLA,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=vOXfqGQF,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-09-18T08:19:30.668+0000)\n>\n> Surely you could run LoL at max specs for around half that?\n> Or are you buying from a shop, rather than components online and assembling it yourself?\n> Coz if you are, you&#x27;re paying double.\n\nDon't really know how to build my own PC so :/ and I don't know what parts I would need.","replies":[{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-09-18T11:09:31.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should go on youtube and search up how to build your own PC, although it might be a little expensive it is worth it as you can optimise your specs and graphics card, etc.\n\nLeague shouldn't require a lot of spacing from your computer, but hey the better the specs the better the game or maybe it is a bad saying xD","replies":[]}]}]}]}
