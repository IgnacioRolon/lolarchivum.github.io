When will the 2016 Worlds song be released? If it&#039;s anything near Worlds Collide I&#039;m hyped for it. Please make it soon as I love these songs. \r\n\r\n- BurningAvalanche, OCE, Silver 3, Marksman main.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-09-20T11:27:45.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love them so much as well, and I can't see any reason they wouldn't release one this year. They already have the pre finals song on PBE so I think we can expect something soon :D Of course it may be an instrumental only (as I believe it was pre 2014) but time will tell!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/gXqbcRWDYPI","replies":[]}]}
