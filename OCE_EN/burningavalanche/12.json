In PhyLoL&#039;s recent Lucian video on his Unranked2Diamond series he stated why he thinks the adc role is sh*t this season and it got me thinking whether it would be better to play a supportive style ad carry like sivir and Ashe instead of carries aka Lucian, ezreal, vayne in this current meta. \r\n\r\nThanks for anyone who answered any of these 4 questions :D","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-12-12T03:27:03.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm assuming the winters rift should be coming around next patch which should be near Christmas which makes senese","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-12-11T15:48:44.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">In PhyLoL's recent Lucian video on his Unranked2Diamond series he stated why he thinks the adc role is sh*t this season and it got me thinking whether it would be better to play a supportive style ad carry like sivir and Ashe instead of carries aka Lucian, ezreal, vayne in this current meta.\n\nI'll tackle this one for you.\n\nBasically Utility style ADC's, (Jhin, Ashe) Safe ADC's, (Trist, Caitlyn, Ezreal) and stupid ADC's (Vayne, Twitch, and what i mean by this is that they are both OP for different reasons, this will probably change) are likely to be strong this season UNTIL ADC's aren't suffering the one shot issues they are currently.\n\nATM ADC's suffer from the fact that \"Kill the ADC\" is just so damn easy with so many different champions/lanes, that picking out of the first 2 blocks is basically required to live as your either not in the fight (utility) or you can self peel extremely hard (Safe)\n\nThe Stupid list of ADC's are just ADC's that have a reason they are broken at this point, in Vayne and Twitch.\n\nVayne has uncounterable stealth, so a good vayne can rip a team to shreds without taking much damage.\n\nTwitch enters the fight stealthed and can rip apart a team's health really easily, and the 1-2 seconds you get to live for basically guarantee that your team can win the fight.\n\nThe lane bully ADC's (Lucian) and the Hypercarry ADC's (Jinx, Kog'maw) will come into meta when the ADC's have less issues, and can be strong against teams that lack dive/damage/assassination power.","replies":[{"poster":"BurningAvalanche","date":"2016-12-12T03:25:43.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Valor Carrys,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Tf13KvcA,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-12-11T15:48:44.726+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;ll tackle this one for you.\n> \n> Basically Utility style ADC&#x27;s, (Jhin, Ashe) Safe ADC&#x27;s, (Trist, Caitlyn, Ezreal) and stupid ADC&#x27;s (Vayne, Twitch, and what i mean by this is that they are both OP for different reasons, this will probably change) are likely to be strong this season UNTIL ADC&#x27;s aren&#x27;t suffering the one shot issues they are currently.\n> \n> ATM ADC&#x27;s suffer from the fact that &quot;Kill the ADC&quot; is just so damn easy with so many different champions/lanes, that picking out of the first 2 blocks is basically required to live as your either not in the fight (utility) or you can self peel extremely hard (Safe)\n> \n> The Stupid list of ADC&#x27;s are just ADC&#x27;s that have a reason they are broken at this point, in Vayne and Twitch.\n> \n> Vayne has uncounterable stealth, so a good vayne can rip a team to shreds without taking much damage.\n> \n> Twitch enters the fight stealthed and can rip apart a team&#x27;s health really easily, and the 1-2 seconds you get to live for basically guarantee that your team can win the fight.\n> \n> The lane bully ADC&#x27;s (Lucian) and the Hypercarry ADC&#x27;s (Jinx, Kog&#x27;maw) will come into meta when the ADC&#x27;s have less issues, and can be strong against teams that lack dive/damage/assassination power.\n\nThanks for going in-depth with that, and thanks for answering my question aswell. :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Glow","date":"2016-12-11T19:15:25.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I've seen a lot of people in twitch and YouTube just completely get rid of what they are saying in the chat with 1 button and I want to know how to do that, will stop me from sending embrassing remarks or angering my teammates.\n\nI think I know what you mean here, after you type something you can press Esc and it will just delete what you typed instead of having to send/backspace it.
