It'd be a limit far too high to ever worry about reaching in a real game, but if you felt like messing around with bots for a REALLY long time you could probably hit it. I imagine it'd be at least up in the 100s, that or it'd just get so high something would break and the game would crash.\n\nShort answer: No.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-06-12T05:59:03.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Programatically the limit would be 255 assuming riot stores the passive stacks in an Integer based variable.\n\nTake thresh stacks, they have the same limit where you reach 255 souls and in order to break that limitation they just start a new stack and roll the previous stack into a secondary stacks counting how many 255 stacks you have.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-06-15T01:07:31.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe so, but it would be effectively capped at 80 stacks, as that would provide 100% of the targets health as damage, meaning 1-hit kills all around (anything more would be redundant).","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-06-15T01:31:57.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Omgosh I didn't think of that, that's insane!
