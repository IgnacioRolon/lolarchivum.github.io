It's performed by individuals who are capable of reaching higher levels of rank (generally Platinum or Diamond). There are several factors that can indicate a person is being boosted in this manner including, but not limited to; a temporary change in IP address (as a player, you wont be able to see this), changes in the way summoner spells are \"bound\" (for example, changing Flash from D to F or vice versa), an \"unnatural\" boost in K/D/A and a sudden increase in MMR.\n\nIt also occurs that players may boost others by queuing with them rather than using their account, which is generally harder to detect but still incurs serious punishments if/when the players get caught.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-07T03:13:34.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much bang on, though \"duo boosting\" is a bit more of a grey area, and it's pretty unclear how harshly it's judged.

Seras? I know you went through this a bit. But what process would you go through to ban someone due to duo boosting? I know you said it is a bit of a grey area but what would be some other pointers for Duo boosting or perhaps a reason to ban someone for suspicion of duo boosting. See i have dynamic pref meaning i lobby a lot, being b5 ofc im not being boosted but if i were suddenly to get to platinum, and you could see a player that i had consistently been playing ranked with, would that give a reason to ban?\nFInal question, sorry if it feels like im wasting your time Dx, if there is proof of two players (one boosting another), do both players get a ban? (or same punishment if not a ban?) Or is it only the booster who gets a ban?\nThanks for reading :D","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-11T07:15:54.372+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll answer your last question first, just because it's easiest.\n\n> if there is proof of two players (one boosting another), do both players get a ban?\n\nYes. The punishment for boosting (or being boosted) is typically a two week suspension with loss of ranked rewards for that season.\n\n>  But what process would you go through to ban someone due to duo boosting?\n\nOn Riot's side, not a clue, but it's likely handled case by case. Player side, same way as anything else, report it in post lobby, or failing that for whatever reason, submit a support ticket.\n\n> a reason to ban someone for suspicion of duo boosting\n\nAs far as I know it's handled case by case, but if they're playing with someone who they can legally queue with, even if the skill disparity is high, they aren't going to be punished (i.e S5 playing with a G1, even if said G1 belongs in Plat).\n\n> but if i were suddenly to get to platinum, and you could see a player that i had consistently been playing ranked with, would that give a reason to ban?\n\nHonestly, I couldn't say for sure. If you got to Plat within a couple weeks, I'd probably say yes, otherwise difficult to say. I'm afraid even us volunteers aren't privy to much detailed information here.\n\nHopefully I helped a little, I know I couldn't give you clear answers on everything you wanted but hopefully it clarified a few things at least.","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-11-13T22:41:46.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, cool thanks for taking the time to answer.
