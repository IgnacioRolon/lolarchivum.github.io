I know alot of people learning new champs use it so they don&#039;t have to worry about remembering their build. And it&#039;s just convenient to have it there. I have a situational area that allows me to choose a defensive item on adc and a Misc. tab for potions, wards, elixirs and sweepers. Please Riot I really think they are a great addition and I don&#039;t want to see them go.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-11-16T00:12:45.256+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"_\"Barely anyone used it, so lets take it away!\"_\n\nSooooo, shall we take away all the fire escapes too?","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-11-21T14:23:45.743+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's even funnier because every uses item sets, especially all the pros and those are the only people they care about anyway.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"pypski","date":"2016-11-21T12:39:52.751+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah.. bummed to see no item sets in the new client... </3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Somebody not you","date":"2016-11-15T13:31:04.313+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play mainly Support/ADC with a little AP top or mid so I have one Item Set that has 5 blocks and covers all champs I play and all situations.
