Then I picked up Pantheon and kind of had to change the camera to unlock. I also had a few friends telling me it would be better for me to play with an unlocked camera. For a few months my camera control was awful (I'd lose sight of my champion regularly), but over time it did become easier. Practice is the key, now I always play with an unlocked camera :) \n\nYou may find it useful decreasing the sensitivity of your mouse, this helped me. I also used to sometimes lock my camera for team fights. \n\nBest of luck","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-01-21T23:57:50.856+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spacebar baby.

Just try using it without locked and if you ever need to lock on to your player, hold the space bar. I would also try doing bots first to feel more comfortable with it. It takes time for some, others it's quick. Took me a while but now I can't use locked camera without it feeling limited.","replies":[{"poster":"BurningAvalanche","date":"2016-01-21T15:28:14.577+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a ton!

I started playing League with a locked camera and then managed to shift off to free camera. Then, sometime over the past season, I think I shifted into just holding space bar to keep the camera on my champion but also having the freedom to move my camera around. Everyone has their own personal preference, though. I'd stick with holding space bar until you can naturally shift into keeping everything in a frame.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sailor Jupiter","date":"2016-01-22T09:40:00.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try playing some mechanically easy champs like Garen while learning unlocked camera.
