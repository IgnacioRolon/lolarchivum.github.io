If Draven doesn't drop his axes he can beat pretty much any other ADC if things are equal.\n\nThe thing you can do is play around him when he's cs'ing and trying to catch his axes, you know roughly where he will be and can Q or something in that direction to get him.\n\nLucian being short range and Jhin being immobile, Draven can certainly be a pain in the ass. I can see if you can manage to root the draven, force him to drop and axe and take the fight from there as Jhin it might go well, but again, you need a support who can either CC Draven or protect you (or both, like a Braum).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2016-08-28T04:30:06.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just poke from afar since both those champions have way more skill shot harass potential than Draven without being hit, and if he chases you just lead him into your creeps, wait for him to hit you once with one auto to attract the minions then run away while shooting skill shots at him when your out of range or your jumping away, leading him onto a trap and especially if he's retreating from realizing his mistake too late. Lol I've even made tank Vaynes for support that seem harmless at first but if my team kites around me properly the  hurt from auto attacks and blocking enemy skill shots really starts stacking up over time or turning ad champions into ad casters and taking more than 4/5 hp if I'm uber fed. But I stopped Vayne tanking much now since some people cringe and chat all game about it and saying I'm trolling until they end up trolling on purpose, feeding, rage quitting, afk griefing or just flaming with no evidence of bad plays yet-.- There are too many oracles in this game lol. #buttheyarentoracles http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment/y3y9Hcgn-aram-team-serious-aram-players-only?comment=0009","replies":[]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-08-28T04:20:55.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same as any other champion. Take as lil poke as possible and try to poke particularly with you're crit shot when he gets out of position. You're both strong at farming though and have strong early game damage. As Barrybutcher suggest the supports play a big role but tell you're support to just wait till you get a free hit then engage or wait till someone is clearly out of position. Depending on the support he has things can go really wrong really quick against Draven,\nAs for Lucian he just pokes and farms at the same time so you can play aggressive or passive either way just be good at Lucian and you should win that match up.","replies":[]}]}
