Like what are you guys trying to fucking do? Did yous want Ranked to be like normal&#039;s? but with the Auto fill there is no point in selecting 2 fucking roles because your never gonna get the one you select. Normal Game are toxic enough we don&#039;t need this shit in ranked Fix it or you are going to start losing players to dota 2. Its beyond a joke right now what were you guys thinking by putting it in ? to reduce queue times? Well that didn&#039;t work at all so time to Take it off and try a different method. so many dumb ideas and so many broken champs doesn&#039;t even look or feel like you care about the people that plays YOUR GAME.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-08-03T09:06:27.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People often forget that you can trade roles in champion select. Even if it gives you a random role, you can talk to other players and maybe swap for one of your main roles. In theory it's just like the old champion select.\n\nOnly [0.06% of players in Bronze get autofill](https://am-a.akamaihd.net/image?f=https://news-a.akamaihd.net/public/images/articles/2016/june/DQU/graph-autofilling.jpg?v=1), so it shouldn't be a very common occurrence for you anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Star","date":"2016-08-03T14:05:56.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ What this guy/girl said. \n\nI have to deal with autofill in every game. You still get your role like 80% of the time, so it doesn't bother me.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-03T09:38:57.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have yet to do ranked on this account but I know I'm bronze 5. But autofill sounds fun even though that generally, fill = support. I don't even mind support since it's my main role but I can fill. I feel autofill isn't going to fix queue times because most people have a specific role but having people pick that option is still ok.\nI don't see how autofill is an improvement over the people that pick sup/fill already though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-08-03T06:58:28.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't auto fill like diamond + ?","replies":[{"poster":"TheBrizzle","date":"2016-08-03T07:27:28.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope It goes throught all ranks im in bronze and i have to fucking do it.","replies":[]}]}]}
