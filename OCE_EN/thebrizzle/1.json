Like I said its a decent add to league but it has no limits which is what is needed because you could be and a search time for 20+ minutes then you finally get in a game and they remake.......... how is that fair... they need to make it first blood within 3 minutes off the game means no remake I have spoken to a lot of people and they agree with what I am saying. what do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-08-15T23:40:28.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You actually aren't supposed to be able to remake if there has been a first blood. I've been told it's a glitch at the moment though where you can remake even if there has been one.\n\nIn my opinion the remake system is totally flawed and should just be removed or changed so it's more fair. Yes, being in a 4v5 sucks, but having to wait in a queue longer than the actual game sucks even more.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-27T03:20:07.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can remake after first blood, so long as the afk is flagged before first blood. It's basically so someone can't just afk after first blood because they don't want to play the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GooddayMate","date":"2016-11-27T02:22:30.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the 3 min remake rule is not that useful though lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-08-16T01:56:51.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They changed the first blood rule, people were 5 man diving bot lane and forcing them to remain in the 4v5, I agree the system isn't perfect, and I'm sure you would agree the other 3 team members shouldn't be punished because someone had a lapse of judgement and gave away first blood","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vexus","date":"2016-08-15T17:32:58.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"meh, you'd be crying if you couldn't remake if you were on the 4v5 team as opposed to the the 5v4 team","replies":[]}]}
