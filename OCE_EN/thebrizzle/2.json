RP system is a very dangerous and risky codings as they need to get every code correct. By calling them ''useless'' just makes it very hard for them to actually complete them. So please wait patiently and as always, send a ticket to riot\n\nNOTE: This may take at least 48 hours for them to reply as they are backed up with other request from other players. Please wait patiently!","replies":[{"poster":"MeiBei","date":"2016-04-21T01:58:51.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with **KaSing**, Just give it time and surely they will fix the problem. Just send a ticket and wait for a reply. Don't become a total brat and go spamming around other posts about how crappy Riot is atm **@DeathSoulja**. Yes mate im talking specifically on you because every post I click on (relating to the RP issue) I see your name with either a rude comment to riot or simply complaining non-stop about your RP not going to your account. Please, have the decency to wait patiently and let the professional team work on the issue. Clearly if more posts are popping about this issue, it will pop onto riots ''concern'' list and they will try their best to fix it. As for now just sit and wait patiently just like the rest of us.\n\nYours sincerely\n-Diamond IV","replies":[{"poster":"Kill Paradise","date":"2016-04-21T03:55:47.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It should be on the \"concern\" list regardless, its people's money. I agree we should be patient but its hard when the ticket i sent didn't even get read they just saw the Subject line and assumed it was the generic problem they have a general fix for. no one has given any reason as to why the System isn't working, which is why people are getting annoyed.","replies":[{"poster":"MeiBei","date":"2016-04-21T05:24:22.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I sent mine yesterday and got a reply today. I was pretty much the first person to send a ticket about this problem and so now more people are sending tickets to riot. Dont forget they have to also read other peoples tickets like banned accounts, computer issues, client issues etc. Im pretty sure they are trying to get to your request. Make sure to ready your #number on your request as it tells you how many people have requested something. Im pretty sure that if you were in their shoes, it would be difficult to go to everyone. Some issues are bigger than just this RP system. Thats why SephirothSG is going to everyones forum, concerning with the RP issue to send a ticket. If you go to my forum post and my ticket, they replied saying that they will refer me to someone in the ''billing'' industry. I too am waiting for them to reply. \n\nAs what KaSing said, they will take atleast 2 days to get to your request. Also im sure the team is working on fixing it which is shown on the yellow icon next to your name on the top right corner. Keep waiting patiently and you will get your RP.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"c1osed","date":"2016-04-20T09:30:33.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just want to get the rp, because i want to paly hex annie...because i need yellow piece","replies":[{"poster":"TheBrizzle","date":"2016-04-20T09:40:21.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wanna buy Jhin and a few hextech chest but it doesnt look like we going to get a resolve anytime soon","replies":[{"poster":"c1osed","date":"2016-04-20T09:50:36.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":".ffs, i don't like the skin or anything they give to me, the skin they give to me is not worth than hex annie, i just want my rp, and ffs, why only oceania rp system is not working","replies":[{"poster":"TheBrizzle","date":"2016-04-20T11:35:01.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You got a skin ? lucky you I havent got anything from them","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"iMr OpTiMiSm","date":"2016-04-20T08:08:28.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Waiting for a response Riot","replies":[{"poster":"TheBrizzle","date":"2016-04-20T09:02:41.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We all are but they wont reply to us they will make us wait a week or 2 and do it all by ticketing and i promise you that we wont get RP it has happened to me before they gifted me a skin worth 10 bucks when I put 30 on so expect no RP","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-20T08:44:44.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nYou'll have to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) to Player Support to have them check out the situation and add the RP to your account manually.\n\nPlease note, support is currently backlogged and requests could take up to 48 hours for an initial response.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheBrizzle","date":"2016-04-20T07:02:12.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So guessing This isnt going to be sorted for fair time..........
