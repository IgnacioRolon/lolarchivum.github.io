You can apply for an account here: https://pbesignup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/pbe\n\nIt doesn't look like OCE is one of the supported regions but if you have an NA account (or if you make one) you can sign up there. EU and a few others are also supported but you'll need to replace the NA with x region in the link.\n\nPBE accounts are limited and you aren't guaranteed to get one, but being in NZ doesn't stop you applying for one.","replies":[{"poster":"Tempered in Salt","date":"2016-07-31T10:15:08.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually i have an OCE account and was able to obtain one the Alpha Client site actually says they want people from different regions of the world so they can better play test it.\n\n... i think.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-07-31T15:08:26.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Alpha Client and the PBE are very different.
