I didn't really rank them but the first one in each line is probably my top pick in terms of carrying with the least skill.\nGaren is really hard to kill and very strong, Fizz is really hard to kill if you build tank and is really strong. Malphite is a pretty simply hard to kill tank (or full AP) jungler who has most of his potential loaded in an amazing teamfight ability. Soraka is pretty simple and learning how to kite and poke as her makes her really strong without too much mechanical investment. Sivir has a spellshield and very good waveclear, farming, she has high mana costs but she can also put out alot of earlygame burst damage and poke and she has an extremely strong lategame and teamfight through her w, passive and her ult, allowing her to kite for days. Her passive makes her one of the easiest adcs to kite with and her ult keeps her relevant no matter how behind.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-10-26T03:00:35.320+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Since when is Yasuo an easy champ?","replies":[{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-10-26T03:06:19.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since always, hes easy for me atleastt","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ErÃ¸se","date":"2016-10-26T10:35:08.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Buy a Xp boost because it doubles the Xp you earn.
