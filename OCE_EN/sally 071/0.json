Is it possible to leave just dynamic queue or even just have a plain solo queue because otherwise wait times on this server are going to be unbearable.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-03-07T07:24:31.363+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"NO!\n\nHave you ever been in Bronze?\n\nIn the higher ranks whoever has the better premade wins, down in the depths of hell it is whoever has the worst premade loses. You get 2-4 man premades on each team and guaranteed you are either going to have donkeys in one of those premades, or a smurf.\n\nFrom almost 60 ranked games this season, I have had like 4 that were close, the rest were so one sided, they shouldn't have even been games.\n\n2 games come to mind, one game I went 9/1 as Nasus and ended it in like 17 minutes, no one else had anymore than 2 kills. The other game the enemy Graves was something like 6/0 5 minutes and from there we collapsed like a deck of cards.\n\nI don't premade like I used to, I don't at all anymore in fact, so I either go against the shit premade and have a field day, or get smashed 10 minutes in, there is almost no in between.\n\nAnd the rage you get, those premades who suck ass, they can never admit it was them or their friends who are bad, they have to pick on the other players and blame them regardless of anything. I've even had games as the only player without a negative KDA on my team and doing all the work to carry them, but they still rage at me and blame me for the loss, couldn't possibly be them or their friends fault, it never is.","replies":[{"poster":"Sally 071","date":"2016-03-08T00:11:33.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have accounts in bronze.
