What was your first skin? Doesn't matter if it was gifted or bought. If you want, put a little history behind it :)\r\nMine was Battlecast {{champion:161}} \r\n\r\nI started playing when Vel'Koz was released, and contemplated buying him for about a week or so (was feeling nervous about it because he looked complicated and I think I was level 13 or something), then I just yolo'd it and spent the first amount of rp I bought on him. A second week later I got his skin because I loved playing him so much. Still play him to this day :D","replies":[{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-02-14T22:52:41.268+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought it was customary for all new players to spend the rp you get from leveling up on a master yi skin xd","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-02-17T03:30:52.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I remember correctly, it was Phoenix {{champion:133}}.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2015-02-17T00:49:34.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eternum Nocturne, once my fave champ always my fave champ, and now through mystery gifts i have all but ravager","replies":[]},{"poster":"Coolbluey","date":"2015-02-16T11:11:39.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My first skin was Sewn Chaos Orianna, because she used to be my main at the time.
