The ults sound pretty amazing, though!\n\nI'm actually pretty excited about playing AP Evelyn with that item - she seems to be the best able to take advantage of that passive. As it's charging both when you're moving and casting spells, she has a lower-cooldown spell that she's able to cast while running, and take full advantage of the Movement Speed.  The other champion that comes to mind is Cassiopeia - once she's chasing you and resetting her E, she's going to charge it up crazy fast. :D","replies":[{"poster":"susanooh0","date":"2015-03-08T19:51:00.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel the same way man","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-06T03:53:50.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh god no, why would you have to put these thoughts in my mind.","replies":[]}]}]}
