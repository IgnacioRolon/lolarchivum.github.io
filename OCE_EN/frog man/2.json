If that does not work, try to run the client as administrator. If that does not work, then please disable fullscreen optimize as this function is still in beta for Windows.\n\nIf above does not work try this: \n\nPlease disable both Game DVR and Game Bar.\n\nTo disable Game DVR, head to Settings > Gaming > Game DVR. Ensure the “Record in the background while I’m playing a game” option here is set to “Off”.\n\nTo disable the Game Bar, head to Settings > Gaming > Game Bar.
