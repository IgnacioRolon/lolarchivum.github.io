The top lane Nasus was the same, sat in top lane most of the game.\n\nIn team select they said they will duo bot lane, but I chose a jungler, so I could easily assume they were duo. They didn't roam, they didn't ping, the usual, but of course I was being blamed for having a bad attitude and all that jazz.\n\nI'm so used to it I just let it go, nothing much you can do.","replies":[]}]}
