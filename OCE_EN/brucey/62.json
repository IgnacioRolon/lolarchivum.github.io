What i basically what to ask is what goal should i be aiming for what&#039;s too big?? I was sadly 106kg to start off with now I&#039;m around 103.5kg or something and wanting to start really getting into some diets or really healthy eating and i know there are heaps of different diets around. My basic day consists of \nBreakfast/Lunch: Omelette with mushrooms and tomatoes (Sometimes do gym for an hour - hour 1/2 )\nDinner i have what my family is having which is always some sort of either Meat/Fish with Veg/Salad. We have take away maybe every 3rd week so not that often.\nGym for an hour 1/2 - 2 hours \nWhen I&#039;m feeling like a snack i have nuts (Almonds, Mixed Nuts, Cranberries) and i always have 2 Fruits a day mainly Bananas and Strawberries.\nIs anything in my daily eating wrong or is it on track now its just waiting for the kgs to go down? I&#039;m not too sporty or have knowledge and have searched up but I&#039;m just so confused each website I go to :( thank you","replies":[{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2016-09-03T02:39:36.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"DISCLAIMER - this is the internet, and you can't trust people on the internet. Especially when it comes to exercise.\n\nHaving said that, I'm a qualified PT (Cert III & IV in Fitness from AIF) and the simple answer to your question is that there's no simple answer. No one training program is perfect for everybody, and the same theory needs to be applied for food.\n\nThe most basic way to break it down is that if you consume less calories than you burn off exercising, you'll lose weight. It really is that simple. \n\nSounds like you're on the right track with what you're eating and just want to fine-tune it. Try having a look at the Zone Diet - it can be a little complicated to understand at first but it's one of the few that really breaks it down on an individual level - essentially the amount of \"blocks\" you consume of the three macronutrients (carbs, protein, fat) are based on your body weight, and if you want to vary your results, you vary your blocks. Simples.\n\nOne last thing I'd say is don't get caught up on the number on your scale. Three years ago I was completely inactive and in terrible shape, and weighed 91kg. Today I weigh 92kg and I've never been in better shape. If you want to track your progress, take measurements of your biceps, thighs, butt, waistline at your bellybutton and chest at your nipple line. Retake the measurements every month and it's a much more reliable way to see results.\n\nGood luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2016-09-03T15:39:34.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Arkangyle,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=3BFEELvJ,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-09-03T02:39:36.805+0000)\n>\n\nHaha yeah i guess.\n\nThank you so much all that help'd especially about measurements i've been worrying so much about the numbers, but i know it won't change suddenly aha just have to keep on track for months and keep motivating myself. \nI've looked at about 10 different diets since i posted this but haven't come across this one. I'll check it out :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2016-09-01T22:18:29.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, good on you for getting into healthy stuff! \n\nLike you said, the hardest thing is dealing with all the conflicting information out there in regards to diet and exercise.  It's best to get information from the pros, rather than a bunch of randoms on the internet who could be giving the the completely wrong information. If you have the money, I would suggest going to a nutritionist (even just for an initial consultation), to discuss your goals and lifestyle to find out what would work for you. \n\nIf you are a lil shy, online personal trainers (make sure they are legit) are a great way to go. I would def recommend gamer2trainer {[twitter](https://twitter.com/gamer2trainer), [website](http://www.gamer2trainer.com))} who offers personalised plans and encouragement. \n\nThere are quite a few tracking apps and and communities around encouragement out there for you to try:\n\n* [Myfitnesspal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com) - calorie and macro-nutrient tracker\n* [Tribesports](http://community.tribesports.com) - take challenges and track exercise (my current obsession)\n* [Weightloss reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/) - read stories and encourage each other","replies":[{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2016-09-01T23:46:54.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yaiamone,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=3BFEELvJ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-09-01T22:18:29.364+0000)\n>\n\nThank you! i wanting to ask on here as there might be some people that be personal trainers or have done some diet and lost weight.
