Would like to know if there is a way so i can make it smaller maybe a way to get rid of the new client stick with legacy or will riot ever delete folders that aren&#039;t needed if there are any to make it as small as they can. most of my other games take hardly anything like CSGO or Rocket League and many more\n","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-12-09T08:27:18.060+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the game is roughly 7GB. But every time you update, it downloads 400-800 MB and doesnt delete the unnecessary stuff. Its good to just do a clean install every 4-5 months if you worries about saving space.\n\nRight now there is a lot more because the new client and other things, so i'd wait until they faze out the legacy client (sometime soon) and then do a clean install.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Montiness","date":"2016-12-10T15:28:36.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"22 gig seems excessive, I'm sitting on 10 with almost 2g worth of logs.... check your log folder. feel free to delete it. It will re-write what it needs and you'll have all those previous games stored in there gone.","replies":[]}]}
