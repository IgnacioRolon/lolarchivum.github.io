Atleast i feel really good about myself that I&#039;ve gotten to Platinum i knew my goal this season was Gold 5 but i some how got to finish at Platinum 2 and got to finish in a Diamond 5 rank team :)","replies":[{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2015-12-23T07:55:20.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you have 600-700 games in ranked and you have climbed to plat then there is no problem. congrats on plat man\n\nbut imo 600-700 games stuck in silver is an issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2015-12-23T08:09:59.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bento Box,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=IOmTBeNV,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-12-23T07:55:20.046+0000)\n>\n> if you have 600-700 games in ranked and you have climbed to plat then there is no problem. congrats on plat man\n> \n> but imo 600-700 games stuck in silver is an issue.\n\nThanks :) yeah being stuck in silver was a problem last season and i hated it but now I'm stuck in platinum for about 6 months now xD but I'm glad where I've finished not even angry","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2015-12-23T02:13:59.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AHHH my title is wrong :< Flamers*","replies":[]}]}
