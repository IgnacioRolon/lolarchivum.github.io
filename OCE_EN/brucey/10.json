Plus how do you come to the conclusion what is a troll or a normal pick just because it&#039;s not played in your pro scene doesn&#039;t make it a troll pick.\nEvery champion can be played in different roles what&#039;s the point on making champions and just saying this champion is just made for jungle and if you go support and main it in that position you&#039;re going to get banned for trolling. \n\nFor example Ivern sup ?? he was made for jungle yet i see people playing him support and being able to win me being one of them.\n\nSo riot please tell me what is your thinking behind all these bans on the Singed sup main and now the Nunu sup main. This is honestly a joke thank you for yet again ruining something people like doing.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-03-03T16:28:16.619+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Do you ward and provide vision control for your team (preferably with a SS)?\n\nDo you stay with your ADC through laning phase with the exception of the occasional roam if an appropriate opportunity presents itself?\n\nDo you support your team and not ditch them in favour of dicking with the enemy team or doing your own thing?\n\nDo you fulfill some variation of the role of support as understood by the majority playerbase?\n\nThe reason those players were banned (and mind, they likely won't be perma'd for it, the precedence Riot has set is for them to just keep receiving 14 day bans for as long as the behaviour continues) isn't that they were playing off meta, but rather that were shafting their teammates in avast number of games. So long as you are receptive to your teams wishes and talk to them rather than at them, you don't have anything to worry about.\n\nThe Singed and the Nunu were being reported in a truly massive number of games. I'd still recommend sticking to more traditional picks in ranked but even there, if your team is ok with it and isn't hating life the whole game because of you, there is no problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-03-04T00:50:26.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"those people weren't banned for champion choice but rather playstyle.\n\nas long as you lane bottom, help your adc, buy a sightstone and generally play like a supp should, everything is fine.\n\nThose bans came from when supports would \"counter jungle\" rather than lane and leave the adc to 2v1. Although an arguement can be made that Riot shouldn't be allowed to dictate how we play, as long as you stick the \"rules of supporting\" its doesnt matter that much who you play.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-03-04T09:23:28.008+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Although an arguement can be made that Riot shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to dictate how we play, as long as you stick the &quot;rules of supporting&quot; its doesnt matter that much who you play.\n\nIt's not so black and white as that, though. If it's a situation where the team agrees to go with an off-META strategy, such as a counter-jungle \"support\", then there's no reason for Riot to do anything (and generally, they wouldn't, since there'd likely be no viable reports from that). Conversely, if the team disagrees on using an off-META strategy, such as the aforementioned counter-jungle \"support\", then Riot *should* intervene, because the player is engaging in intentional acts that are ruining the experience for several other players in a given game (which Riot has said, time and again, is a major reason for the punishment systems).\n\nIt doesn't even come down to the rules of supporting, it comes down to the team configuration the majority of the team chooses to use (which is usually the META of top, mid, bot [ADC and Sup] and jungle). As long as the player is performing to the position as the team understands it, whether it's an on-META or off-META position, then there's no viable reason for a punishment.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-03-04T10:30:26.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a hot topic really, since Riot actually offended their own rules in some respects by banning those 2 players especially the Nunu one. As much as Riot wants to dress the cases as purely behavioural ones saying that they were only banned because they didn't bother to communicate and/or negotiate with the team in any way or something like that, they actually did provide some communication (most so than most players in fact, since most players play a lane using picks that are often associated with that particular lane and so most people don't question nor explain picks because there is no need to; meanwhile the Singed and Nunu players more or less did go through the trouble defending their picks in champ select), and they were really reported and banned on the basis of strategical/pick disagreement rather than a simply being an ass themselves.\n\nCombined with Riots stating that, a different choice of champion or playstyle can not be a reason to punish nor should other players dedicate another's pick, and so the next thing you get is a PR storm.\n\nBut really, most people wouldn't report you for playing Galio or Ivern supp, and even if they do it's highly unlikely that a ban would pass. Reason being, Nunu and Singed are fundamentally different than almost any other champion in the game where, there is almost no other champ besides maybe the sole exception of Teemo that are THIS often associated with trolls and troll-wannabes, which was the core of the reason why they were even reported so much leading to their ban in the first place, because people just assumed them to be trolls due to their champ choice and unpopular lane decision, and for whatever reason Riot also agreed to ban mostly based on that.\n\nIt's just a mess there, if you ask me. I'd be interested to see how Riot would resolve that. But what do I know, maybe I have it wrong, it's entirely possible.\n\n**But in short, no, Galio or Ivern won't have trouble going bot, not at all. Go for it, man.**","replies":[]}]}
