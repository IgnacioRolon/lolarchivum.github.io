I do have to say the amount of trolls, feeders, people that don&#039;t know how to team fight was just too high to explain i went from Silver 3 to Silver 1 like 4 times But i got into my promos for Gold at least 4 times as well which was painful to play i go 2/2 in everyone then the last one theres just this one person thats like oh he&#039;s on his promo lets feed/ troll.  like a jayce top and i was jungle he fed 4 early kills to a riven and NO way am i going to gank that lane and give riven a free double so he decided to sell all his items and just stack tears -.-. But after all that did my promos last night and just playing ap shaco. Im currently on a 6 win streak in ranks playing ap shaco top its just so fun and it got me to my GOAL GOLD I&#039;m so ****ing happy but a pain to try and stay in.\n\n( Saying this i know trolls, feeders, people that get mad are in every rank so i don&#039;t expect it to stop all of a sudden) SO if you&#039;re new make a goal try and strive the best you can i know i did and I&#039;ve got my goal finally if i can so can you. :) {{champion:35}} {{item:3285}}\nPS i know i spelt the title wrong :,(","replies":[{"poster":"Essy","date":"2015-04-15T11:36:44.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":":) good job","replies":[{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2015-04-15T12:08:06.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Essy,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=r8MfTWE2,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-04-15T11:36:44.389+0000)\n>\n> :) good job\n\nThank you :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Holland","date":"2015-04-15T09:36:41.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow nice made to gold from bronze could you tell me the about of time it took for you to reach gold?

TELL ME WHAT YOU DID YOU REACH SILVER!\n\nwell Last season around july i started doing ranks around the time i hit level 30 and placed in b2 which then i didn't play until around september where i wanted to get higher and focused which i was just climbing the ranks in about a week or 2 i reached s3 then got a little hard for me but i made to s2 by the end ( I played a lot of Darius, Vi, Sion, Yasuo in bronze btw). \n\nThen this season went 8/2  placed in Silver 2 been going though getting demoted along the way but reached Gold last night with a 6 win streak of AP Shaco top. \n\nI would say like other Youtubers, popular steamers say MAIN champions its the best way to climb ranks is to main a few get to know the match ups and how to beat them so you can climb with the champion. Like when the new sion came out i mained him and ended up going 18-6 by the end of Season 4 knowing what match ups i can beat and how if i got countered.\n\nEdit: The most important rule for me when i want to climb is to respect each other play as a team and not get angry if you don't get the role you want I'm currently like 22 games with thresh and 18 games with sona at Support but i main jungle, Top but i was nice and let others that say they can't support let them have their roles. Even when i was first pick i would go support ","replies":[{"poster":"Holland","date":"2015-04-15T11:28:51.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry I rarely rage at my team I am usually am supportive but I what I wanted to know how long it took you thats all.
