For a chat restriction, probably not very long (someone on 10 game got their rewards back in a week).\n\nThe deets of it is basically, there is no set time, but you're on a low punishment tier so it shouldn't take too long. Show positive behaviour and you'll get em back real quick, neutral behaviour it'll take a little longer and negative behaviour not until you stop said behaviour.\n\nYou can read more about the restrictions here: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209939463","replies":[{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2016-11-03T09:05:03.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=EBRu8NGN,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-11-03T08:38:55.687+0000)\n>\n\nThank you! knew they said something about it but wasn't sure where exactly they said :)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-03T09:44:25.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries that's what we're here for :P","replies":[]}]}]}]}
