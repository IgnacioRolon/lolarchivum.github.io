I&#039;ve been playing the game since Season 4, I&#039;ve always loved the game and also love learning new skills / champions along the way. As i&#039;ve started a smurf, i&#039;ve noticed quite a few people not understanding the game as much or they are still yet to learn some things. \nI&#039;m not the best myself but i&#039;ve peaked so far high d1 (Sadly d5 now -.- ). I&#039;ve been a coach and analyst for some challenger teams and diamond teams. \nSo to stop trying to sugar coat myself or anything i&#039;ll just be straight up\n\nI&#039;m putting this post here so I can come check every day / few days and answer any questions any one has for league. Even if you think it&#039;s a weird question or a question that is really hard to answer, don&#039;t worry i&#039;ll try to answer it as best as i possibly can. \n\n(Can look at your op.gg if you think that&#039;s easy for you)","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2017-07-09T21:51:09.908+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who is your favorite Anivia 1trick and why","replies":[{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2017-07-10T03:31:35.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm.

BUT if i had to choose one out of them all it has to be Black Phoenix, the father of all Anivia mains :^)\n\nHe is the kindest and respectful person i've met so far that mains anivia ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PhishnCrits","date":"2017-07-10T12:27:20.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What would you recommend to me if I wanted to climb? This is in solo q because most of my friends are either unwillingly to play it or already have done their placements and have gotten much higher then I likely will","replies":[{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2017-07-10T13:35:01.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay common question. The climbing of solo queue isn't champions itself but in some cases yes you can spam Syndra or Malz to get some freelo but in order to learn things and get better watch yourself on replays, see what you can do better maybe you can roam or something i've learnt a lot that way. What ever you main watch other pros or known players that play those champions and learn what they do and apply them into your gameplay","replies":[]}]}]}
