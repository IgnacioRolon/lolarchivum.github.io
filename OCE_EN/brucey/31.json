Yeh e might be a click to win but hay at least I&#039;ve seen your match history and all you play is zed and kat sorry but don&#039;t call someone unskilled when you play those champions heaps XD Makes me laugh every time \n13/2 with shaco having a 7 win steak and currently on a 5 win streak.","replies":[{"poster":"Ekrah","date":"2015-04-20T18:13:57.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played AP shaco support here and there when I was Bronze, I would get flamed during champion select and at the start of the game.

I would always place several boxes than walk up to their tower to make my hp low...they would follow me into brush and I would kill them with box damage, e + ignite. Also another thing I loved doing was sitting in enemy jungle (mostly raptor brush) with a pink ward in a brush that had several boxes and wait for someone to facecheck, as soon as they walk in they go 100 - 0 instantly. AP shaco is fun to play and very strong, although I do recommend playing it in norms for fun. :P","replies":[{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2015-04-21T03:26:55.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ekrah,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=1Q6kE7Gl,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-04-20T18:13:57.525+0000)\n>\n> I played AP shaco support here and there when I was Bronze, I would get flamed during champion select and at the start of the game.

But some of the loses are from playing ad jungle think i will stick to ap xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-04-17T15:27:17.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only play viable champs or i'll report u","replies":[{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2015-04-17T16:26:30.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WEETBIX 4 BREKKI,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=1Q6kE7Gl,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-04-17T15:27:17.470+0000)\n>\n> Only play viable champs or i'll report u\n\nDo that then xD won't stop me","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-17T03:26:06.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">you need to correctly place boxes\n\nBox in a path the enemy will walk\n\nMuch skill.","replies":[{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2015-04-17T03:40:34.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=1Q6kE7Gl,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-04-17T03:26:06.093+0000)\n>\n> Box in a path the enemy will walk\n> \n> Much skill.\n\nNo thats the easy way there is heaps of ways you can place it. Illuminati shaco, Put boxes in river like teemo shrooms, The easy way just place it in front of the enemy. Yes people that don't play shaco say its easy and no skill when actually it does each champions takes a little skill and understanding of the champion before you can start winning. \nBut hay haters gonna hate","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2015-04-16T23:24:48.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"DW about the haters bra, just play who ya love, and u appear to love shaco.
