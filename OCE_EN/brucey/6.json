If you want to get a gold income item and you can't cs worth a damn then ancient coin would serve you better since it again gives you more sustain and a useful combat stat (cdr) and it's not entirely a dead item since it can situational but ok when finished. \nIf you need more gold as an adc Cull is great item to snowball but only if you are really good as csing and 100cs during a 15min laning phase shouldn't really be hard for an adc (I'm a support/jg main so my csing is horrible but even I can get ~120cs during laning phase as the adc, so if you can get 100cs by 10min you'll probably win lane). Spellthiefs isn't actually gold efficient for an adc and if you just went doran's blade, you would have better combat stats and more ad which makes it easier to cs. Early combat stats are important for adc's. Spellthief is just not a good item on an adc unless you are atrocious at csing since spellthief can't earn you gold if you got a cs in the last 12s ( i think that's how long).\n\nBasically, Cull = sustain through laning phase and snowball through cs gold lead, Doran's blade = Duel through laning phase, Spellthief = don't get cs and poke with mana which won't really work, since a good adc will just zone you since you can't out sustain them with hp and you can't duel them.\n\nAs a support main If I see an adc try to build spellthiefs, I swear to god I'll lose it. I don't care if my adc can't fight worth a damn, I can handle that, I'll fight and zone and they just farm and we can survive the laning phase and come out even. But if you build spellthiefs and don't get any cs, and can't get any gold and can't kill towers and objectives fast, what is the point of having you. ADC is a carry role and the support is there to protect you and make it easier for you get cs, so that lategame you can melt towers and dish out damage during a teamfight. Also if I see an enemy adc building spelltheifs it makes zoning them soo much easier, since they can't trade with me and so sure they might get a little gold from spellthiefs but they will have no cs and will be forced to back since I outsustain them and then they fall behind in levels and then I can 1v1 and kill them. Supports are gold efficent, adcs are not. ADCs needs as much gold as possible and a kill is only worth about 15cs, so if the enemy adc has 60 more cs than you. They have 4 more kills worth of gold. That's the difference between being fed and feeding in terms of pure gold and levels.\n\nIf you need csing practice, make a custom game, with nobody in it, and try to hit 10cs per minute with no interference and don't use abilities, only aa's and try to move around while doing it. Then do it with an intermediate bot, then 2. Try to get 10cs per minute and kill them when you can (but don't die and if you do miss cs to get a kill remember 1 kill = 15cs plus forcing them back so they miss cs), by trading with the bots with abilities and hitting them with aas when they try to get cs whilst not missing any of your cs. Even if this not as good as real laning; I promise you will be alot better as an adc. Do this every few weeks, and your csing, positioning, trading, lane control, forcing backs and getting a level advantage and generally winning any lane (aside from jg) will be remarkably better, allowing you to stomp enemy lanes that you might have lost to in the past.","replies":[{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2016-08-06T01:17:04.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why I don't push and harass between last hits...

You have ult for surpRYZE ganks, can rush Runic Echoes for early damage and MS, stacking tear becomes very easy against jungle camps and a Catalyst gives some good sustain.\n\nBut it doesn't stop there.
