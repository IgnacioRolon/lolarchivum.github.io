She had a different skin in production at the time and this meant adding a completely new skin (in addition to Azir) at a time we hadn’t planned for one (let alone two).** But after listening to all of you (and Bang)** we knew we had an opportunity to really get this right. So, we added the Kalista skin and we hope you’re as happy as we are with it! \n\nhttp://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-pbe-feedback/92fqQk0e-speaking-of-skt-skins-its-time-for-an-update","replies":[{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2016-07-26T09:23:01.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BarryButcher,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=PF7yE07z,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-07-26T08:57:31.190+0000)\n>\n> its not about who is good right now.
