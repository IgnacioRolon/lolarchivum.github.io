You have tuned the system so we can get more s&#039;s with the introduction of mastery 6/7 but I&#039;ve done like 10 leona games I&#039;ve got really good kda but still get an S- ????

The more deaths you have the more kills/assists you'll need and depending on how many you end up having there's a point where an S rank becomes impossible. I think the change has made it so the value of assists equals that of kills but this still means low deaths and whatever else it tracks are still important.","replies":[{"poster":"JohnnyMunchkin","date":"2016-07-15T08:33:07.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a Ryze sup get an S- just now going 5/9/21.
