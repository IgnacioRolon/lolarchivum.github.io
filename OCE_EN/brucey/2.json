But she cant even benefit from that in the early laning phase like she used to have on her old passive. She now has to get in melee range of creeps to even proc her heal in lane, which leaves her open to poke, pretty much mitigating all heal she would get from the auto in the first place.\n\n>Im a Big Dummy\n\nYou're not wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Toxic Shaco","date":"2016-11-25T01:12:31.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PeasentCominThru,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=aqfGAEwE,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-11-24T05:17:46.122+0000)\n>\n> AoE CC, Gragas Body Slam and Ult, Ahri Charm, Ao Shin Ult, Azir  Ult, Blitz Hook, Darius Hook, Draven CC, Galeo Ult, Gnar Ult, Hecarim Ult, Janna Ult, Kled Hook, Ori Ult, Poppy Ult, Shen Taunt, Shyvanna Ult, Syndra Knockback, Taliya Ult, T H R E S H, Xin Ult, Z A C, Ziggs Satchel\n> \nSo Counterpick, not counterplay.\n\n\n\n> Flash is 425 Unit Blink\n> Akali gets a 250 Unit Blink\n\n> 425=/=250\n\n\nCan she cross through terrain?

Plus it's enough to go over walls or dodge a spell a major spell like Aurelion sol ult or jump over Azir wall. Plus all of these are easily either escapable or can be dodged saying these won't make them an instant counter to her shroud. \n\nHer in built healing if you have not seen she can easily when completed gun blade gets 150-200 hp back just with her healing part of the passive every like 4 seconds which is around level 6 i think not sure.\n\nAnd you play her as a lane bully not a farming champion. You need to get ahead in order to get something done late game sitting their farming just makes your opponents harder to kill.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-11-24T05:34:18.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*insertSteveCarrellslamingdesksayingTHANKYOUhere*","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-11-24T05:32:37.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, you played her in Twisted Treeline with your team has higher rank than your opponent.\nEven if you play Urgot or ADC soraka there you would be OP.\n\nStalker reference: http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=FS%20Bruce","replies":[{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2016-11-24T06:03:52.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RonyStark,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=aqfGAEwE,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-11-24T05:32:37.833+0000)\n>\n> Well, you played her in Twisted Treeline with your team has higher rank than your opponent.\n> Even if you play Urgot or ADC soraka there you would be OP.\n> \n> Stalker reference: http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=FS%20Bruce\n\nThank you for looking up my match history if you really wanted that info i had no problem telling you and what is the difference between both. \n\nSaying even if you play urgot or adc soraka clearly makes it sound like you have no clue how or even playing Twisted Treeline. so before you go and judge where I'm saying she feels I'm not saying she is op I'm only saying that she feels stronger then she was since season 4 which was the last time i played her. \n\nPlus people like you don't understand when these reworks come out they ALWAYS have such a low win rate with \"Skill caps\" like these champions. Look Ivern came out with like 48% win rate now people understand him more he is the highest win rate so far and is being played so much in challenger/master games on NA. Also another example with ryze being the lowest win rate when he got a dramatic change to all of his spells.\n\nPlus you're in gold that is where she thrives lul ","replies":[{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-11-24T06:14:37.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"from a normal healthy discussion to \"people like you\" discussion.\nok then\n/mute","replies":[{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2016-11-24T10:04:13.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RonyStark,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=aqfGAEwE,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2016-11-24T06:14:37.846+0000)\n>\n> from a normal healthy discussion to &quot;people like you&quot; discussion.\n> ok then\n> /mute\n\nSorry coming from someone who looked up my match history to point out something that people might find funny. \nBye /block","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
