WHO takes mid and doesn't know how to play the  champ now my promos are ruined because someone wanted to try out a champion in ranks…..   But hay i guess ill now get stuck with more silver trollers. So I deserve gold but no all these people have a cry because either 1. we don't gank… as people say gank winning lane is better then they can carry. 2. KNOW YOUR LANE before you come to ranks yes i know people get stuck in support but not when your 2nd pick. 3. FOLLOW your enemy if she roams if not push don't stand there having a go at us because we didn't ward (which we did) 4 MOST IMPORTANT RULE THAT SILVERS DONT UNDERSTAND PING THE GOD DAM MAP WHEN THEY LEAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nSorry for this being so long I'm just so pissed right now need to get it off my shoulders too all you Silvers and Bronze players… \r\n hope you have fun  and have a wonderful day ;D\r\n{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:2044}} {{item:2043}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2015-03-18T06:11:05.011+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are trolls in all of the tiers.

No everyone has to ward its the way to win games for example. Look at silver/bronze/Gold vs akali no one gets pink wards or upgraded sweeper i know because I've had to ask people in at least 10 ranks so far to get pinks or sweeper and its getting annoying to do so because they should know by now.. i don't know feeling like deleting this post due to everyone having a cry about what I've said. i was  aiming to actually get to people how things affect games like wards, choosing lane, and picks..","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2015-03-18T09:42:05.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OMG……………. \nIm not stupid i know I'm going to get close to the same but its higher up so you get mostly better people I've played in gold on a friends account for a few games and it feels a lot better then silver but YES I KNOW………… \nAnd Golden Acorn yes i might. I'm not going to say that I'm demanding i go to gold or I'm the best and should go to gold. I still have things to get better with but  i think I've earned gold I've carried almost every promo and that 1 promo just that 1 i got a troll and made me go back so yes everyone gets mad but what got me madder was that it was either Go to Gold or stay in silver. Which my goal was to get to gold by the end of the season so finishing it this early it just feels good and then bam!!! a troll on my last promo just makes me sad :,( But yeh sorry I'm meant to be in bronze 5….","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-03-18T06:59:29.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ImDuhN00B,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=EQlPZAGo,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-03-18T06:00:04.952+0000)\n> 4 MOST IMPORTANT RULE THAT SILVERS DONT UNDERSTAND PING THE GOD DAM MAP WHEN THEY LEAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nso that's just going to magically change when you get to gold? you're still matched with the same players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2015-03-18T06:19:15.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I laughed...
