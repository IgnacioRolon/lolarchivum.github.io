If you took the passive approach they may of given up (Or not). Now they have probably got what they wanted from you. (No doubt it wasn't their main account they care about as well). \nLesson learnt I hope. You cant vent your frustration at all on chat, because you will be held accountable for what you have done regardless of what they may have done to you.\n\nIn saying that, if you feel a neutral party being Riot would see your side, you can send in a support ticket with your version and evidence of that game. They may lift your last ban etc. (As its an automated system ban).","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-19T23:24:00.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Though it's worth noting they cannot lift perma bans.

And i have to put in  i asked the other team and my other 2 team mates if they could please report nunu and lucain and near the end of the game nunu and lucian called me toxic after the whole game swearing and saying that he has done nothing when he ruined the game and made us lose and then they cry about how i was being so toxic which i find funny cause everyone would a little salty i got so angry that i just muted them the whole game from 15 mins till 45 mins where we lost and in the end game lobby they all reported me for verbal abuse.  (He didn't get his role he wanted cause he was last pick so he went trolling) But hay everyone likes it when riot sticks up for trollers in League……  Right??","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-20T22:58:42.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well they could have very well been punished too, I wouldn't know. What I can say is you should have been emailed a reform card, if you got it it should theoretically demonstrate why you were punished (I believe the system is more aware of people on repeat offences so that could be part of it) and theoretically you'll know what you did wrong. If you didn't get one then send in a ticket cause you should have.
