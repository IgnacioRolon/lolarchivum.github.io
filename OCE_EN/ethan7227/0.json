What I have come up with will blow your minds.\nStar-Lord- A champion with dual guns, obviously {{champion:236}} comes to mind. Homeguard effect- Star-Lord flies via Jet Boots[](https://www.google.com/search?q=star+lord+jet+boots&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-xYmBuIrVAhUX4mMKHcSNAEwQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=662#imgrc=QvJOS2_nx7-l4M:) so that could be the homeguard animation      Also, there could be the infamous Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.1 and Vol.2 like a DJ Sona type of skin. Once you put the Star-Lord mask on {{champion:236}} He&#039;ll look pretty good\n\nGamora- An assassin, {{champion:55}} will do. Make her green and give {{champion:55}} the dagger[](https://www.google.com/search?q=Guardians+of+the+galaxy+vol.2+gamora&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmk-fFuYrVAhVeHGMKHUrTD4cQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=662#imgrc=l5oaP0ErwZ0MEM:) and she&#039;ll be armed and ready.\n\nDrax, the Destroyer:A tank, either {{champion:2}} or {{champion:14}}. Probably {{champion:2}} since he is more auto attack based and his abilities are more \"Drax\"\n\nGroot: obviously {{champion:57}} I mean, trees, Who else. His \"E\" could be Baby Groots in the pot as seen at the end of Guardians of the galaxy Vol.1 then, when they're running it could be Baby Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 when he runs.[](https://www.google.com/search?q=baby+groot+running&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiG8NqOvIrVAhVS-mMKHWubBp4Q_AUICygC&biw=1366&bih=662#imgrc=_05PdgeBvG0K1M:)\n\nAnd Finally, Rocket Racoon: Sadly the closest ADC there is to Rocket is {{champion:18}} But, that wouldn't work for obvious reasons so he would have to be {{champion:17}} with a gun. Maybe {{champion:18}} would work though.\n\nSo, the dream team would be: {{champion:236}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:2}} and{{champion:18}} \n\nLet me know what you think!","replies":[{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-07-19T00:25:54.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice thinking !\n\nI don't think Riot can 'rip off' the marvel comics tho?\n\nHowever, I find it funny you think Tristana would be the racoon. Like tris is a yordle??\n\nUnless these are april fool skins 'not rocket' haha!\n\nGood ideas tho {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-07-15T05:45:03.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For Peter, yeah, it does seem to be restricted to Lucian. Probably the only other semi-viable candidate would be Draaaaven! As long as Lucian retained his skin colour, it's all good. He already has a \"white\" skin.\n\nGamora, definitely go with Katarina. Akali *might* work, but Kat certainly seems to fit the character better.\n\nDrax would *definitely* have to be Olaf. Drax is often depicted as dual wielding, daggers for the movies, \"laser axes\" in the animated series, etc. Also would fit the character quite well.\n\nGroot. Gee, I don't know... Zac would probably be a better Groot, man... Just saying...\n\nHave to disagree with you, Rocket would *definitely* have to be Rumble. I mean, come on. Small, furry, mechsuit, ROCKETS! It fits *perfectly*. (pretty sure Rocket did actually create a mechsuit in the animated series).\n\nAll that said, it wouldn't happen (and if it did the differences would have to be distinct enough so as not to trigger a court case over copyright infringement). It's extremely unlikely that whoever would need to sign off on it would actually sign off on it. Unfortunate but true.","replies":[]}]}
