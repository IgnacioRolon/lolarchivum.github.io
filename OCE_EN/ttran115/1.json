This built up to me ending up with the 20m leavebuster penalties, i understood why i had 20m so i lived with it. Now i haven&#039;t left a game for ages and ive kept receiving messages saying &quot;you have left fewer games...&quot; from riot but then yesterday i had a problem where my game wouldnt launch after champ select. My team remade and now im back to 20m leavebuster.\r\n\r\nSo im  just asking if the timer for leavebuster actually goes down or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-12-27T01:29:25.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does, but it takes a long time. We don't have any exact timeframe, but it's in the realm of months. I think last I heard it was about 3, but don't quote me on that.","replies":[{"poster":"ttran115","date":"2017-12-27T11:23:38.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought they said it goes down by number of games","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-12-28T01:19:39.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"An approximate number might have been given in the past, I couldn't find anything with a quick look. As far as I know it is game based, but I believe it's an individual number (as in specific to you). Any timeframe given would be an average for that reason.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
