My question is why is it using so much internet and how could i stop it from consuming so much internet. And no, there are no updates needed so that cant be one of the reasons.","replies":[{"poster":"Rok","date":"2018-12-09T10:36:58.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"0.1Mbps is fuck all in the grand scheme of things. Its like, 100KBps\nBut i know what you mean, i caught about 400KBps Upload on my Net monitor at the end of a game where i was having a lot of packet loss (has happened 2 games out of like 40+ in last 3 days, both games had neeko in them)\n\nRiot has League uploading something at the end of the game, though, its really questionable as to why? the game has ended, it shouldn't spike up the upload so much if there are no packets being sent to the server from your machine.\n\nRiot is obviously doing something sneaky and should tell us what it is before they get into some trouble.","replies":[]}]}
