I reached b2, but suddenly my performance dropped like mad. I usually go adc and im finding nowadays im not doing as much dmg and just my over performance has worsened. Ive been watching a whole bunch of videos about how to improve gameplay but its not doing any good (or im just not understanding properly). So i was wondering if anyone could give and tips or even watch one of my games and tell me what i did wrong (dont look at the trist game where my kda was 0/5/3 it started raining and internet just died)\r\nthx in advance","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-10-06T11:48:54.621+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because you're not playing darius?","replies":[{"poster":"ttran115","date":"2017-10-06T11:49:25.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lmao want me to go darius adc?","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-10-07T02:01:12.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah man","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2017-10-09T08:56:25.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try to get really good on a champion pool.

Just ask yourself what do you think you're doing wrong and what can you do to improve skills you are more on the soft side for example map awareness, creep score, mechanics or are you engaging in team fights or not, when to back off and when to not back off. Im sure you can climb higher elo by watching your replays especially to tackle the current problems and skills you need to improve for getting that elo you want.\n\nP.S Watching YouTube videos won't make you improve they just give you possible problems you might have (You have to identify them yourself){{item:3187}} {{item:3348}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"xReverie","date":"2017-10-07T04:47:45.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been able to make it to silver this season, and will aim for gold next season.\n\n* Have a small pool of (good / in meta) champions an spam them. 2 champs if possible, 1 that can be played in your off role (for me that's Corki and Ekko). Focus on 2 roles. Champs that are less team reliant, don't depend so much on good positioning are useful. That makes adc difficult somewhat. Also important that you enjoy playing them.\n* You're going to have teams and players, particularly in bronze 2 and 1, that go off by themselves without vision, play aggressively, and get caught out. Always check what your team's doing and be nearby to make terrible plays work\n* Learning to win lane, make early advantages, and snowball them, and doing this often can be really effective\n* Need to get better at last hitting. This will come with time, but you can actively practise it too.\n* Spam ranked. Good chance you'll finish bronze this season. Yes you care about your rank, however you need experience playing ranked to improve. Ranked is very different, and you get punished a lot more for your mistakes. Flex isn't too bad and you can play there if you have to.\n* Learn mindfulness / third space - resilience to tilt, and the ability to focus on the game and your next play\n* /mute all. Be friendly in chat. Ping when summoners are used. Comms your next play. Use pings.\n\nLike me you're playing catch up by the looks. I started late season 5 and have had to acquire the game knowledge and skills to be able to climb. There are a lot of people who have been playing for longer than you and you need to surpass / improve more than they have in the time they've been / are playing.\n\nFocusing on a few champs that aren't team reliant can get you good at some mechanics, and allow you to focus more on your next play, awareness, vision, and being useful to your team.\n\nYou improve MUCH faster when you play ranked.\n\nMain thing I see is that you play WAY too many champions and roles (something I've done in the past too).\n\nAlso watch the 'chase your legend' vids: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=lol+chase+your+legend\n\nSummary of these:\n- What's your goal / ambition when you play? Get to high elo? Use it as a tool\n- It's going to take a lot of work to reach your goal. Practise and get good\n- Learn to become tilt proof, and have the resilience to shrug of the tilt and focus on your goal\n\nProbs more stuff but this is getting long.","replies":[{"poster":"ttran115","date":"2017-10-07T10:29:36.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen all those chase your legend episodes.

This is mainly because Bronze V is the lowest you can go and, like Challenger, means that even though it's only a single division, it's like there are loads of divisions within that division. You have the Bronze V 0 LP players who are Bronze V, and you have the Bronze V 0 LP players that are Cardboard Tier (but are Bronze V because they technically can't go lower). When I first played Ranked and ended up in Bronze V, I wasn't a Bronze V player; I was probably a Cardboard V player. I didn't even know what CS was! At best I was getting 1 CS/min *as a Mid Laner*.\n\nAt the moment, you are used to stomping the garbage in Bronze V because lots of them (myself included) are lower than Bronze V, and so the skill gap is huge. Now that you've evened out the skill gap, you are at the stage where there are other players that can also stomp Bronze V (and lower) in your games, and hence are at the same level as you.\n\nTL;DR - Even though all of Bronze is garbage, Bronze V players are even more garbage than Bronze II players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Battlerz","date":"2017-10-06T12:26:51.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well could be that the adc roll its self doesn't suit you for instance. there would be a few factors like what your play-style is and wether you play with heaps of champions which honestly isn't a good idea, stick with just a few champions once you have decided (for other champs that you dont main, only play the champion enough to know about how they work so when you face them in lane so u know what to expect)","replies":[]}]}
