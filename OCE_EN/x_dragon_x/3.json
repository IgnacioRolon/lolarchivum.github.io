Im currently have including myself 3 challenger players who are exceedingly capable and an extremely knowledgeable manager/coach from eu who has wokred with teams and players in the eu series. Instead of forming a new team a thinning the talent pool and making it easier for the people in the opl i was wondering if a super team can be formed? Challenger series teams have put a lot of effort into branding ect... and yet to have been rewarded. The 3 challenger players are exceedingly good and would be extremely competitive against the best in the opl. I can vouch this from personal experience. \r\n\r\nWould simply like to have a discussion if possible","replies":[]}
