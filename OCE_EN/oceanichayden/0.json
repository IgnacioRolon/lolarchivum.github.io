You can surely go up 1 division in 162 if you are good enough.\n\nA little harsh truth, take it as you will: Riot will NEVER say this, but honestly, if you look at the ranking system, the actual ranking Pyramid starts with Silver. If you are Bronze, its basically saying you shouldn't have started ranked yet because you aren't good enough (also a reason why Bronze don't get borders since its not an achievement).\n\nTips for you friend.\n\nYour cs'ing with Le Blanc is aboslutely horrendous. Like awful. You average 2.8 - 3 per 10 minutes when you should at MINIMUM be getting 6. Increasing your CS to that standard alone will get you into Silver on average since its basically doubling your gold from minions.\nYou get more CS as jungle Rengar than you do as Mid le blanc. Kinda bad. Dude, even if you have to take the extra damage to minions mastery and take AD marks just to last hit better, do it. Its worth it.\n\nYour builds seem ok. You never build Zhonyas which is weird to me but its fine. Also, Lich Bane is not a good item on her.\nRunes are ok too. A little greedy with the scaling HP rather than flat, but whatever, its fine.\n\nLooking purely at your match history the only bad thing is your CS'ing, most other things Bronze people fail at you seem to be ok.","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-05-23T02:36:09.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your point about the pyramid is absolute nonsense and makes no sense.

You are 1 out of 5 of your team and you cannot win a game without your team unless the enemy team is just that bad. So win or loss, from faker to a bronzie, they are never the sole reason for a win or loss. Since that is all riot currently dictates as your level of ability, it is literally impossible for a player to achieve their true rank systematically. No one should be judged by their rank.\n\nRiot have even announced that they are under serving those who wish to communicate their individual performance. This needs more global recognition though because everyone still seems to be completely oblivious to it.","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-05-23T22:17:32.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=whitePumah,realm=OCE,application-id=mR0UmRrp,discussion-id=gpJEdYtu,comment-id=00070000000000000000,timestamp=2016-05-23T12:46:42.327+0000)\n>\n> People wouldn&#x27;t being arguing with it if that were true, but you see there are also smurfs.\n\n\nIt literally is true though. Like, there is no argument. There is no possible way for anyone to disprove it. Its just one of those facts.\nYeh, there's smurfs too. And they will be on the enemy team 20% more too. So let's be conservative and assume there are equal amounts of smurfs and baddies. Obviously you're gonna win the games vs baddies and lose the games vs smurfs. So in those games, you can't influence the result. Unfortunate but true.\nBUT. (Why the fuck does everyone ALWAYS forget this) there are games with no baddies and.no smurfs! There are games that are well matched. The problem with peoples' mindset though is that they are unable to recognise those games. If they lose a well matched game they blame someone on their team despite that someone proving 20% of the influence of your team, just like everyone else. If they win a well matched game, they assume that they and their team just out skilled the enemy team.\nDo you not see a problem with this pattern? People create trolls and baddies and their minds. \n\n\nYou also touched on how one individual cannot influence this game. But you are advocating for how much a single person on your team can make you lose.

Work on your cs. Also, if you wanna climb, don't play support, it's too reliant on noob teammates to carry. If you do play support, remember your two most important roles: vision control, and peeling for your carries. In the games in your history, you are not getting a sweeping lens to deny the enemy vision around objectives. You'll still lose a lot of games as support, even when you do your best though, it's best to play mid lane, or jungle in my opinion. Because then at least you can get one lane of your noob team ahead, it gives you some winning conditions.\n\nAll of these mathematical arguments about which team has afk/feeders/trolls/noobs are irrelevant in the long term at low elo. After a while you will start to climb if you are better than the average noob in a carry role. This season I was placed in Bronze 2, and went straight to Silver 5 without much effort (playing support btw). And I was Silver 4 last season. In your teams you'll get heaps of shitters that don't watch pro games, or try to improve, and only play for winning, even when they don't know how to win. Of course they will remain shitters. So just work on your play, and find some niche champions that suit your style. Also if dickheads in your team try to make you do something you don't want to do (e.g. you are a split pushing Tryndamere and they tell you to group for some stupid fight in the jungle over no objective whatsoever), think what's best and if that is just doing your own thing (e.g. getting the next tower), then do that. Don't be swayed by a pack of noobs. They will never learn, they will always blame, and they will always be low elo. Don't fall into their trap. Mute them and move on to winning ways.\n\nAfter a while you will be able to smash noobs with ease.\n\n[Check out this game where I duoed with a Bronze 3 Zed in the bot lane](http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/133129463/200912352?tab=overview).

Also you do not improve and climb by blaming your teams.\nI was literally falling between Bronze III and IV the first 40 or so games this season. My win rate was horrendous. Then in the next 60 games, I climbed from Bronze IV 80LP to Silver V at about 60-65% win rate. It was the fastest and most consistent I have ever climbed (and I spent 550 games in Bronze last season). What did I do? I went into nearly every game with a strong mindset, set on the art of winning, set on taking down objectives, taking down every part of the enemy's base and not caring about KDA. There are also a few other things, such as not getting caught and dying. Improving your map awareness and decision making will help with this.\n\nAnother thing is not tilting from your losses, but accepting them and moving on. I used to tilt so bad after certain games it would cause a significant loss streak. Some losses are beyond your control, but what is in your control is how much you tilt after those losses.
