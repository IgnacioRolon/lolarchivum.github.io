However, mid last year I came back and more predominately this year I have been very active playing a lot.\n\nUnfortunately, all my friends that I used to play with have since either stopped playing or moved on to other games and I am left alone. I personally find this game a hell of a lot more enjoyable when I play with others so if there&#039;s anyone that would like to play urf/arams/normals/ranked (maybe, eventually..) or just hang out and chat about pro league or just league in general, feel free to add me and lets have a chat or play. Make sure you comment here so I know who you are.\n\nI play jungle/support and I am very active on varying times of the day/night.\n\nHope you all have a great weekend!","replies":[{"poster":"YukiHikado","date":"2018-07-03T05:27:31.261+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"added","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devi","date":"2018-07-01T14:18:22.882+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll play if you want (added you){{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Graves Bot","date":"2018-07-16T11:29:49.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"added you!! &lt;3- \n\n\nIGN: Graves Bot{{champion:104}}","replies":[]}]}
