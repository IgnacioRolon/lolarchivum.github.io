I went positive, stole baron, stole drag, kept the game going ten minutes longer than it should have to finally suffer my first defeat on Sej ever. I&#039;m now 8-1 on her which is upsetting but what aggravated me was the end screen and finding I had lost 24 LP. Now I had won a few in a row and was at 65 LP but every time I lose one game, I lose over 20 LP while I gain 8-13 LP on most occasions. I&#039;m sorry RIOT but this is most unfair, I love the game but am very disappointed that your players are punished for someone else leaving, yes you punish them but we do we also deserve to be punished? Please if you could either explain to me or link me to how the LP system works so I understand if it is fair and just or if like this game I deserve to be losing less than 10 LP for doing more than most can of a very difficult situation. Thank you\r\n-Ashplague","replies":[]}
