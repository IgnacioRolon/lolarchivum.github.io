You lost your jungle and ours now has no pressure. If 2 players are gonna go at it verbally and the others end up having enough of it then why do we get banned defending ourselves? 6 of the 7 other players still in the game lost their cool in post game, all 5 of my team and 1 of his 3 which was the fiddle, only one who didn&#039;t was his premade... Riot please explain because I have not violated anything other than been afk in a game years ago...

The system is pretty on top of punishments for such language, and while they don't always result in an instant 14 day ban, they usually do. It's worth noting however that support can't give you any information about another player's account, implicitly or explicitly, so you likely won't hear anything beyond that it's being/been looked into.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-09-20T08:29:26.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First things first, if you believe you got falsely punished, you should appeal the ban by submitting a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Account suspensions or restrictions\" option). They will review the case and make a decision on whether the punishment was appropriate.\n\nStraight up, I can see why this ban was triggered. Regardless of when it occurred, or the circumstances it occurred in, things like suicide encouragement, sexism/racism/homophobia etc are taken *very* seriously, and can result in escalation of punishments in some circumstances, and while not taken as seriously things like insults and a generally negative attitude can also contribute to punishments. It's important to note that these punishments are issued as a result of *your* behaviour, not the behaviour of others. It is *your* responsibility (not that of Riot's or other players) to control your own actions, and if you lack such control you should be striving to fix that, rather than simply blaming the situation on others (as you seem so ready to do).\n\nJust to be clear, here's a few exerts from your chat logs that support the ban:\n> Ashplague: be salty kid\n> ...\n> Ashplague: keep sucking ire dick\n> ...\n> Ashplague: moron\n> Ashplague: you're actually so salty and retarded\n> Ashplague: you would lose to intro bots\n> Ashplague: yeah cause you got under my skin %%%%\n> Ashplague: kys\n> ...\n> Ashplague: report nunu but not afks im that annoyed gj retard","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-09-20T13:14:14.005+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spot on :)\n\nTo add to this, defending yourself and firing back are not the same. Telling someone to kill themselves isn't a defence. Riot's stance on retaliation is that two wrongs just make double the negativity, and each player will be held responsible for their own offences, regardless of who 'started it'.\n\n>[WHY WAS I PUNISHED WHEN THE OTHER PERSON WAS WORSE OR STARTED IT!](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-#h1q7)\n\n>Simply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other playerâ€™s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game.If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ashplague","date":"2018-09-21T05:10:00.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I understand this and I shouldn't have questioned my ban rather question why he didn't get banned and was issued a warning for saying things worse that hit all the criteria you have mentioned, I accept the 14 days as I did make this mistake but the Nunu and the Kayn to not receive a ban and the Kayn not even to receive a warning make this completely unjust, I should have just muted him but that's hindsight for you","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CNFAAGFKU","date":"2018-09-20T13:58:54.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah ill go dc for a kid picking nunu mid.
