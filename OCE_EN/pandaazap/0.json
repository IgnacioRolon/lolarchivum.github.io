The reports are busted someone can duo with another person and double report you and you can report someone but they wont get banned but you will due to the reports no matter if the other person actually was flaming or trolling.

I have been reported in games where I played very good, and broke no community rules. But because I complained about my bot and mid lane inting, they reported me, and I got a ban from it. The system is automatic. No one looks at your report. All it takes is people to report you.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-09-23T06:52:19.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BV 4 Lyfe,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=EgP5Vq33,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-09-23T02:59:59.554+0000)\n>\n> broke no community rules. \n> ...\n> I complained about my bot and mid lane\n\nI'd just like to point out that these two are practically always mutually exclusive. Complaining about individuals, in and of itself, is fairly negative, and often leads to insults. Given your general attitude in all of your posts thus far, the reasonable conclusion is that you explicitly did the wrong thing when complaining about your team mates and that is what resulted in your punishment (not having it be due to some flaw in the system).","replies":[{"poster":"BV 4 Lyfe","date":"2018-09-24T08:04:56.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=EgP5Vq33,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2018-09-23T06:52:19.034+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;d just like to point out that these two are practically always mutually exclusive.

I was not abusive, all I said was please report these players for inting.

I've seen your chat logs, and it's basically all negative, with some insults thrown in for \"good measure\". Most players wouldn't care to be in a game with someone who has an attitude like that.

They will manually review the case and come to a decision as to whether the punishment was in error. Keep in mind, their decision is final.\n\nAs for the chat logs you've provided, yes, it is toxic. It's certainly not among the most serious of offences, but there are plenty of players who wouldn't like to be matched with someone who has your attitude. You've exhibited a consistently negative attitude throughout the match, which is never going to help, and doing things like insulting team mates (such as calling them \"spastics\") and threatening not to help and even actively disrupting team mates (regardless of whether you follow through) is not acceptable behaviour. I would also like to take a moment to say that how well you play is *completely* irrelevant to whether you've broken the rules (the chat logs make it seem like you don't understand that).\n\nAs far as whether you deserved the tier of punishment you received, that depends on a few factors, such as what punishment you have received and what punishments you have previously received. If you wish to discuss that here, you'll need to provide more information. For reference, the standard progression for chat-offences is 10-game chat restriction *then* 25-game chat restriction *then* 14-day ban *then* permanent ban (if you haven't been through the standard progression, I'd say you *might* have a case for reduction).","replies":[]},{"poster":"CNFAAGFKU","date":"2018-09-17T14:14:53.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot ban can even you for swearing using non-English words.
