Also, some roles are less popular than others (i.e. support in particular). IMO they should remove normal blind pick in preference for TB. I'm against ranked TB (which is coming to NA this year) on our server though it's just a bad idea because we have such a low population.\n\nIf you want faster queue times on TB, queue up for support.","replies":[{"poster":"AugustNightmares","date":"2015-02-26T06:02:14.202+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's funny cause I'm a support main and always pick that xD.

In general TB is pretty deserted on OCE because people realise the queues are long so they don't bother queuing up, leading to even longer queues. It's a vicious cycle that Riot has failed to address adequately. They need to remove blind pick, even if they replace it with draft.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-26T06:04:40.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yes lets remove choice by making days that are team builder and ranked only.\n\n*facepalm*\n\nIf anything just making it be TB and draft, drop Blind.","replies":[{"poster":"Strat","date":"2015-02-26T06:12:52.748+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Removing choice means shorter queues in the remaining choices. Blind pick is a flawed system and there's no reason for it to exist any longer. I agree that they could replace it with draft, I'd support either one as long as blind pick is removed. I actually prefer draft to TB personally, but that's because I'm a ranked addict.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-02-26T05:56:18.174+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Totally agree with this. We should remove blind pick and replace it with  team builder (get the role you want and champ you want) **and** draft pick (bans, counter picks, team comps)","replies":[{"poster":"Strat","date":"2015-02-26T06:00:00.944+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can get behind this. The concept of blind pick is stupid and since we now have options to replace it I don't know why Riot's taking so long to remove it from the smaller servers like ours. I guess the main issue they're afraid of is that people will stop playing if TB ends up having long queues even without blind pick, which is definitely a possibility. Having draft normals as an alternative would prevent this issue from happening.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-26T05:54:22.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"My issue with teambuilder?\n\nIt isn't draft pick.","replies":[]}]}
