To be fair it&#039;s THAT important in Norms, but does the system think it&#039;s alright to pair Unranked/Bronze/Silver players with Plats and Diamonds? I&#039;ve included a picture showing some of my recent matches but this happens all the time. I know Oce has less players but... come on... you telling me there&#039;s no other Silver players looking for a match?","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-04-05T17:41:15.530+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Here we go again with the same post for the millionth time, two things one normal matchmaking is different from ranked and secondly there is almost always a premade in normals which will will obviously make the teams unbalanced.\n\nWhy is google.com so hard for people to use? Instead we get people that just post the same dumb thread that's been posted a million times already when a simple google search will give you the answer.","replies":[{"poster":"AugustNightmares","date":"2015-04-06T02:01:28.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I tried to find an answer but nothing came up.

I'd say most of these games are matched as best they can for the players queuing at the time (low pop server factor). The last game you had a 4 man on your team with a 5 man premade on the other side, with premades the matchmaking can be wild as most of the time it tries to find a similar amount of premade players for the other team. Also the premade on your side could have won a few in a row, conversely the other team may have lost a lot of games in a row.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-04-05T00:16:13.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe it's called \"pre-made\"?\n\nDuhhhh","replies":[{"poster":"AugustNightmares","date":"2015-04-05T01:31:28.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I bet you're right.
