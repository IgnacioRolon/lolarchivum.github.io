In no way does this justify a permaban.\r\n\r\nYes, I did all the things leading up to the permaban. But once I had received my 14 day, I was practically reformed. I was used to /mute all at start of the game, and the only times I was &#039;toxic&#039; is was when I was in a premade 5 and we were on discord.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-09-25T23:16:31.039+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a feeling you have left something or many somethings out of that chat log.  ðŸ¤”","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-09-26T04:38:53.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dont they always lol","replies":[{"poster":"xkevinz","date":"2017-09-28T11:30:07.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, this is literally it :).\n\nHence why im posting here.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-09-29T00:51:16.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's ok bro, you can run down mid in this game but as long as you're nice in chat you won't get banned. That's how this stupid report system works. I got perma banned similarly for flaming someone who trolled me in a ranked game and they got away free and I was the one that got punished. Just make a new account and never say a single thing in chat again and you wont ever get punished, I did just that and got level 4 honour on my smurf yesterday.","replies":[]}]}
