Do you enjoy the small details of League, and can spare time to become an analyst for players who have played on the world stage? \r\n\r\nI'm currently looking for 1-2 hard-working dedicated analysts to assist me with collecting data from OGN and LPL/LSPL, as well as other tournaments in Korea and China. Your role would consist of tracking warding patterns, champion pick/bans and early level strategies including invades, lane-swaps and cheeses.\r\n\r\nTo be successful in this role you do not require previous experience, as I will help train every analyst personally, however having experience is certainly an advantage! You must also be comfortable using spreadsheets to collect, sort and present data, and mostly have an enthusiastic and positive approach to being an analyst.\r\n\r\nIf you feel like you have the skills required, and are curious about the position, please feel free to add me on OCE LoL @ SKT Bogus, and I will give you more details.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nBogus.","replies":[{"poster":"Nestay","date":"2014-12-21T18:34:41.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could do all the above and then some.","replies":[]},{"poster":"choms","date":"2014-12-19T23:59:37.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Added you","replies":[]}]}
