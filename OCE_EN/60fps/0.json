It&#039;s blatantly unfair and I&#039;m unable to enjoy the game due to the constant afkers, feeders and trolls. please look into the matchmaking system riot and possibly change the algorithms so i&#039;m matched with team mates with a similar skill level. thankyou. \n\nAs you guys can see from the screenshots I have a half decent amount of farm each game (they all ended at 20 minutes), I had all those kills with 0 deaths every game but when people roamed I fell behind (the most recent game I just farmed and neither me or my lane opponent died). \n\nDon&#039;t bother replying if you&#039;re gonna say something like &quot;you should of carried&quot; &quot;it&#039;s your fault&quot; etc.\n\nPlease help me.","replies":[{"poster":"60FPS","date":"2015-12-04T06:45:21.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well Wuks it was meant to be technical support as there's an error in the elo system or matching system.
