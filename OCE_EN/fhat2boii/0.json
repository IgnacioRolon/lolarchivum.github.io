Usually many people are routed to a specific server mirror for them by their ISP for faster data transfer, but during peak times this proves to be suboptimal and everyone suffers. It wouldn't be related to your account ban.\n\n>skins were bought to but im not going to spend another large amount of money on skins when i know it would be a waste ifthe smurf got banned to\n\nI strongly suggest refraining from spending money on this if you've been banned before. You'll never know if it will happen again, and any money you spent here will become worthless and unrefundable.\n\nFor the moment, you should also avoid playing on your smurf account. If you can ask Riot via support ticket exactly *what* you were banned for (you don't need the details, just what was going on) then you could deduce whether it's safe to continue playing or not.\n\nFor security you might also want to format your hard-disk and reinstall your OS, as well as switch ISP. It's very costly to do that, though.","replies":[{"poster":"Fhat2Boii","date":"2015-06-23T05:12:43.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the thing with it is i can understand why my smurf account hasnt been banned but the main has because if it was the case that something was on my computer with me not knowing it should have banned both the accounts and not just the one that i have level 30 and all my skins champions and friends on also my friend that lives in a different state got banned for the same thing yet we havent played for a fair while now due to my work hours conflicting with his banned on the same day to\n\ni havent even had a suspension or ban before this so i dont understand why it was just a instant suspension\n\non the details they will only release that i was using scripts hacks exploits or 3rd party information and thats all i get from them they wont say what it exactly was but it doesnt give me much to go on \n\ni only played on my smurf when i was bored so its still low level thats why i tended to play on my main on aram and normals not so much ranked games as i was trying to hone my skills to be a better player before trying to advance ranks","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-18T11:45:11.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Two things might have happened.\n\n1. A person who was using exploits has/was using the same IP as you, causing your account to be banned for it.\n\n2. There's something in the way you've connecting which is requesting more data/retrieving different data than what the server intends to give it, which could be the result of using a VPN or proxy.\n\nThis is presuming you aren't using an exploit yourself. An alternative is that you've unintentionally downloaded a script and are using that unwillingly, or your computer has some sort of virus.\n\nIn any case, you should appeal for a lift, which is what you've already kind of done. Policy here is that you're not really meant to post content regarding account suspensions on the boards, because we usually can't do anything about it, but this seems like an exceptional case. The support team aren't willing to even attempt to admit it might be a fault on their end and that your account was wrongfully banned?","replies":[]}]}
