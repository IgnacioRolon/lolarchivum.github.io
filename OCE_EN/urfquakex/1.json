I restart my PC, and reconnect, and it takes a little bit but it does end up loading eventually. Been happening for about a month, resulting in people choosing to /remake just as I get into games.\n\nPls help.\n\nPS. If I load into a quick custom the problem seems to not occur. But definitely not ideal.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-11-07T07:34:59.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nAre you using a wired or wireless connection?\n\nSwitch to a wired connection if possible, does this issue still occur?","replies":[{"poster":"Urfquakex","date":"2016-11-08T09:01:17.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Using a wired connection already :(","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-11-09T07:07:45.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you do the following for me;\n\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP.
