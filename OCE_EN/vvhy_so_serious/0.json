Since you needed a champion near you to provide the (minimal) exp it defeats the purpose of why you took them. I actually think that problem is that while cutting back the actual choices, there are too many possible load-outs for different champions that I think that maybe expanding on the 20 page cap wouldn't hurt...\n\nBut yeah, just experiment with them. Right now, I'm trying the \"Bonds of Stone\" mastery with Braum and my other tanky supports.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2015-11-11T03:22:25.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=VVhy So Serious,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=KXBEzefl,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-11-11T02:53:02.989+0000)\n>\n> With the new patch 5.2.2 coming out, Riot has reworked the masteries.

The main problem being that during the time I'm moving between lanes, there's champion near me to give that experience! \n\nIn more seriousness, the amount of exp was relatively small if you actually roamed a lot - which was generally my style of play in S2015/S4.  I actually think a bunch of other changes in the game - gold generation over time, other new masteries, shutdown gold becoming global, less other roles buying wards, and some really sweet tank-masteries will probably increase support's relative power this season.","replies":[]}]}
