I was loading into a game where I was disconnected(This was most likely from packet loss)where I went to reconnect and was send back to the lobby where I could go back into queue? So I logged off and on only to have to install the previous patch(a flaw in which I feel like should be optional as it wastes more time) and I logged on to find that I got leaverbuster for it. \r\n\r\nWould really appreciate an explanation towards why I couldn&#039;t just reconnect.\r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"4y5tvb8","date":"2018-05-04T11:21:50.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Apparently its an Optus issue. To save you time, Riot have said they will let us know when its ok to play ranked.\n\nAs for your Lp, its gone. And the leaverbuster will stand. Exact thing happened to me 3 times.
