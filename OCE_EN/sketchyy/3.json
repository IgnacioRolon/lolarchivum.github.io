This has opened up the opportunity for fresh faces to join the team and help the team achieve their goals.\n\nWe are looking for people who are dedicated and willing to learn and improve as a team and communicate effectively in game. Whilst rank is not as important to us as long as you are willing to improve, we do ask that you are ranked at least platinum.\n\nAs of now our old practice schedule has been removed, so no solid hours are in place. However, it is expected that all players can dedicate at least 3 hours every second day to team practice, as well as be able to play in online tournaments and some lans.\n\nTryouts will begin as soon as we have an adequate number of people to trial. To apply, simply post here with the following info\n\nIGN:\nAge:\nTeamspeak (Yes/No):\nWhy we should chose you over others:\n\n\n\nAs a side note, we are also looking for people who may be interested in spectating/analysing our games and giving us constructive criticism, as well as potentially theorycraft and craft team compositions for us. For the coaching position we ask that players are ranked diamond or higher.\n\nThanks,\n\nSketchyy","replies":[{"poster":"Fleez","date":"2014-12-09T07:40:55.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: Esardo\nAge: 16\nTeamspeak (Yes/No): Yes\nWhy we should chose you over others: i know how to operate in ranked 5s, good at communicating, mechanics arent the best but i convey information great (in lane/teamfighting). dedicated player wont be late to practise etc","replies":[]}]}
