We currently have 5 players, but at least one of our players won&#039;t be able to stay for the whole tournament if we make it that far. As such we&#039;re looking for a few people who would be available anytime between 1pm and 7pm tomorrow to play with us in case we need you. \r\n\r\nFeel free to add me on league, or discord at Sketchyy #5306","replies":[{"poster":"SeibaPendragon","date":"2018-09-21T13:15:43.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was gold now silver check my stats on op.gg main support","replies":[]}]}
