On his many travels he has thought about leaving his old life behind, starting new in a place like the warrior city of Targon, learning the different ways of battle from those more honourable than those he once knew as warriors. He has even thought about settling down and finding a new life in a place like Valoran, but he knew he could not be at peace until the real murderer was found and put to justice&hellip;\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Yasuo sat by the grave of his brother on the fifth anniversary of his passing, he played his flute with as much beauty as if the wind itself was singing a melody. Yasuo has come to his brothers resting place every year, to bring with him a different melody to soothe his brothers aching spirit. He left the shrine under the cover of moonlight and set off to continue his search. The next day, as Yasuo was resting behind a tree just outside of the Village Krodes, he heard two boys playing and talking amongst themselves. &ldquo;My mother told me that there is a man who can control the wind with his mind, he is performing in all the cities, apparently he is on his way here right now!&rdquo; What this child had said shocked Yasuo. He was afraid that they might have mistaken him for the man, and Ionian forces were hunting him down as the children spoke. The next thought in Yasuo&rsquo;s head was, is this the the man I&rsquo;ve been looking for? &ldquo;That&rsquo;s incredible!&rdquo; Said the younger looking boy. &ldquo;I wonder if he can fly!&rdquo; His brother responded with a loud sigh and then said, &ldquo;I highly doubt that he can make himself or people fly, but I reckon he can make your new pet poro fly!&rdquo; When the younger boy responded he sounded terrified. &ldquo;No, not -&rdquo; Whatever he said next was cut off by a loud crowd ooh-ing and aah-ing. Yasuo was intrigued so he headed into the town after the boys had left. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs he entered the village he immediately saw a large tornado in the centre of the people, who had a mix of shocked, terrified and amazed expressions on their faces. Yasuo pushed his way to the front and found a man, in his mid thirties with neat, black hair that went down his back to almost touch the ground. 50 metres ahead of him there was a table with jars spread along it. The man suddenly began to float and, with a huge gush of air, caused bullets of air to go crashing into the pots causing them to explode in a cloud of dust. Silence spread across the crowd and then a massive wave of noise. Yasuo could make out that most of the noise was &lsquo;whoops&rsquo; and he heard one man say that he has the gift of the gods. The man raised his hands and the crowd was silenced in an instant. &ldquo;I am thankful for your praise but it is not necessary. But I am an incredibly busy man so if you wish for me to stay, it will require a payment.&rdquo; With that everyone threw their money to the man, he caught it with a breeze and sent into a pocket inside his shirt. The man had a devious looking grin on his  face and then yelled at the top of his lungs, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get started!&rdquo;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter six hours of performing, the man called it a night and retreated into the hut the village people had prepared for him. Yasuo waited till dusk, and then, snuck into the hut and walked silently to his bed side. Then gripping the silk nightgown and pulling the man up from his sleeping position, he whispered into his ear, &ldquo;I have some questions that I know you have the answers to.&rdquo; The man replied by asking his name. &ldquo;I am Yasuo, and I think you know what  I want.&rdquo; In a blur the man hit Yasuo in the stomach with a gust of wind and stood in front of Yasuo. He leaned close to his ear and said, &ldquo;I know who you are, warrior. And I am indeed the one you have been looking for.&rdquo; With a gush of wind the mysterious man left and when Yasuo looked around the room all his possessions were gone as well. In the man&rsquo;s place was a note. It read:\r\n\r\n&lsquo;One day we will meet, warrior, and the battle shall be fierce, it shall ravage the place you once called home and will put one of our souls to rest. I did not want to kill the elder at first, but it set me onto a long road of violence and trickery that I would not give up for anything. My soul is lost but yours is not. The Summoners would call the coming battle a decider in the battle for Justice in this world. I call it a chance at redemption for one of us. Search for me. We will do battle by the next blossom of the Sarkos tree. \r\n\r\n&bull;Tsaruko, the Master of Wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Yasuo&rsquo;s rage at Tsaruko&rsquo;s cowardice, he destroyed the hut with a round sweep of his blade, causing a large spiral to ascend and slowly fade away into the nights sky. Yasuo walked out of the town and, with the wind at his back, journeyed to Mount Targon to pray for strength. Yasuo fell many times on his journey to the mount, and when he fell for the fifth time, a man wearing glistening armour came into view. They exchanged very few words but, inspired by the man&rsquo;s strength to carry on up the mountain, Yasuo himself felt inspired. So he left the mountain after praying, with a new fire in his heart...\r\n\r\n\r\nSix months had passed, Yasuo had met a girl on his travels and had settled down for a good few months of happiness and love, but he had a quest to fulfill. So he set off searching. He first went to the power hungry city state of Noxus, thinking the man would be attracted to the place due to the thirst for power that all citizens had. He was unsuccessful. On his way out of the city, there was a young woman with a sword that had runes on it that would have been worthy of the summoners, or even the ancients themselves. &ldquo;Hey, you with the weak sword!&rdquo; She called out, with a mocking tone. &ldquo;Are you a noble warrior? Do you wish to confront me?&rdquo; Taking this as a challenge, Yasuo simply bowed and drew his sword, as his code of honour forces him to fight. &ldquo;I am Riven, the backbone of the Noxian army.&rdquo; Yasuo simply bowed and said, &ldquo;I am the Unforgiven.&rdquo; With a blur of light Riven&rsquo;s sword became illuminated with a strong, green glow. Yasuo dashed forward and so did Riven,  with a loud clash of metal, and the two simultaneous sounds of sword on flesh. They came to the ground on one knee, facing away from each other, clutching their sides. They rose and walked by each other, and without a word, left each other behind.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother 5 months passed while Yasuo was journeying to different cities and the blossoming of the Sarkos tree was soon to arrive. Yasuo was once again praying at the shrine in Ionia under the cover of moonlight. He was playing a new melody that in his heart told his brother about the beauty of the sparrows on the wind. There was a large gust of wind and then a voice that Yasuo recognised as Tsaruko. &ldquo;So, tonight&#039;s the night of the great decider. Who would have thought that the two warriors of the wind would battle under the moonlight.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Aye, sounds like a story inked in blood.&rdquo; Yasuo responded with a hint of humour in his voice. &ldquo;That it does Yasuo, that it does.&rdquo; Yasuo stood and walked to the open area in front of the nearby temple. The beautiful Ionian architecture all coming back into Yasuo&rsquo;s head from the day of the attack. Yasuo drew his sword and as his opponent stood opposite him, whistling, he bowed, and ran forward, once again, with the wind at his back.","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T22:09:07.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really enjoyed reading this. A suggestion I can make is that the shift in time and tone breaks up the flow of the story a bit. It's a little jarring to read that Yasuo had settled down, then had immediately set out again on his quest. Perhaps it's a matter of formatting, or maybe you could work the past into the present action. Either way, your style is beautiful and really nice to read :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"xWZDx","date":"2016-07-04T11:47:06.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's nice :D","replies":[]},{"poster":" The Thundercat","date":"2016-06-30T07:47:45.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please comment if you like :) It would really help know what people think because I use stuff like this for other competitions :)","replies":[]}]}
