They do some internships, but I'm pretty sure those are all over in NA and not here in OCE.\n\nIn my experience, there aren't really all that many places that do work experience anymore (and there isn't really any incentives to). Your school can probably help you find some places. Most places that still do it are going to be those that utilise volunteers like op-shops and the like.","replies":[{"poster":"AirzGamez","date":"2019-08-05T11:38:10.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!\nOur school told us that we should try and look for places on our but I can't seem to find any, I really don't want to work in a food shop or an op-shop so do you know anywhere I could do anything tech-related (eg coding, graphics or engineering/it?)\nThanks again for your time","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-05T14:17:10.170+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a general rule, you're only going to find work experience in entry-level jobs (i.e jobs that require no experience or substantial training) unless it's work experience as part of an ongoing degree or certification. There are exceptions of course, but this means that most of your desired options are going to be rather unlikely. \n\nIf nothing else, op-shops are good retail experience, and depending on the location and supervisor they can be a fun time too.\n\nYour best resource is probably going to be google. You may be able to google \"work experience [suburb/city]\" and find some companies that might have positions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
