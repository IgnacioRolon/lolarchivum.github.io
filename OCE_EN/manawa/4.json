I am really open to constructive criticism as I see LoL skill as a craft and I enjoy developing my abilities.  If you can laugh about the misplays and opening admit to fucking up then we&#039;ll get along well.  \n\nI haven&#039;t really mained a lane. I duo&#039;d my Gold 5 placements with my high plat roomate. We alternated playing mid/top and won 9/10. My silver has been going since s3 and I played from B4 to S1 in a month, just filled any position.  Then I started Uni and never touched LoL  for months.  If I find a decent duo partner I want to grow in my consistency with Top and Jungle.  I can play each role efficiently to a high Silver standard but I&#039;d say I&#039;m most comfortable with Jungle. \n\nI&#039;m a bit irregular with playing the game, i&#039;d go hard for a couple months then focus on shit IRL for a bit. But I&#039;m keen to knuckle down for S6 as I want platinum by March.\n\nI&#039;m just after someone a similar age, who is fun and can laugh about shit.  It would be great for someone of a high skill level to touch me up in some areas.  I&#039;m quite consistent and understand most the ground foundation of gameplay.  \n\nSkype:  jordan.whore \nIGN:  Manawa","replies":[]}
