Your attitude in champ select and your willingness to work with your team is important here too as this can already have both positive and negative implications on how your match is going to start and possibly play out.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m sure everyone who plays this game has experienced that jerk/troll player who in champion is clearly against the team from the moment they begin. They start cursing/hurling abuse at someone or everyone on the team, trolling by going against the rest of the team with regard to lanes etc wanted and so forth.  For example, a player first comments &quot;adc&quot; (this is fine, you&#039;re stating your preferred lane/position), however then follows up with &quot;or I will F&amp;#% you all up&quot; (not necessary), then following up with more abuse when another team member points out their attitude isn&#039;t a great start for a team game.\r\n\r\nSeeing trolling behavior/terrible team attitudes etc in champ select is generally a clear sign that your next 20-50 minutes could be an utterly painful experience, and is not why we want to play this game. Being stuck with someone like that for that period of time isn&#039;t healthy for the team or a game that is trying to enforce a positive/fun experience whilst you play.\r\n\r\nHaving a system where you can initiate a vote in champ select to kick someone from your team that is like this would be beneficial. \r\nHaving 3/5 player vote to win would mean duo partners can&#039;t escape this and would have to behave also. If you think it may be abused a little, impose a limit of 4-5 votes per 24hrs which would help players vote responsibly and thoughtfully instead of just troll banning for laughs. If vote is successful the game is disbanded players go back into queue as normal and that player who was voted out gets a time penalty (which increases if they continue to do it and report sent off automatically to Riot).\r\n\r\nWhilst it is just a game, we all want to win. It takes a lot of time and effort to get to promo games, and to then pass those, it&#039;s time we invest in the game (instead of doing something else). It shouldn&#039;t mean having to deal with some asshole in champ select who you just KNOW is going to f&amp;^# it up for you due to their attitude so early on.\r\n\r\nCurrently, you can&#039;t even leave the game yourself if you know you can&#039;t work with said troll/asshole. If you do, YOU actually cop a penalty, YOU get pulled out of your promo games and/or a timeout from requeuing etc, which I understand and can appreciate what that system is there for, but this doesn&#039;t help when a person is trying to take the reasonable/mature route of &quot;I can&#039;t play with this person, their attitude stinks so I&#039;ll just leave and requeue with another team in a few minutes&quot;.  So again the troll wins. \r\n\r\n\r\nSorry for the long post, here&#039;s a tl;dr version:\r\nHaving a system where you can initiate a vote in champ select to kick someone from your team that is displaying toxic/trolling behavior would be beneficial. \r\nHaving 3/5 player vote to win would mean duo partners can&#039;t escape this and would have to behave also. If you think it may be abused a little, impose a limit of 4-5 votes per 24hrs which would help players vote responsibly and thoughtfully instead of just troll banning for laughs. If vote is successful the game is disbanded players go back into queue as normal and that player who was voted out gets a time penalty (which increases if they continue to do it and report sent off automatically to Riot for review).","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-08-30T04:00:45.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes cause this totally won't be used to force someone else to dodge in your place.\n\n/Sarcasm","replies":[]}]}
