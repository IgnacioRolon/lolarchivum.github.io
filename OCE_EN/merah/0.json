Catalyst Coaching is still expanding!","subforum":"Team Recruitment","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"#Applications are now closed!** We will be accepting more students in the near future but need to comb through this batch first!\n\nWe are Catalyst Coaching and we are back after a summer break ready to kick it up a notch for season end! We have had 600+ applicants to date and a great coaching team to boot (Coaches are diamond+ for consistency). We are a free give back to the community program that has been running since last February. \n\nEdit: all coaches are volunteers so you know we *want* to help others for no other reason than to see our efforts pay off and give a little something back. \n\n\nWe have 35+ available slots and accept all regions. \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A little more about us and what to expect below:**\n\n\n\n- Age. You must be 16+. **BUT** if you are under this age bracket and put forth an excellent application we would still consider you. \n\n- You should be Bronze/Silver/Gold/- Plat 3 to be coached. If you are unranked you must be prepared to start ranked Q after a period of settling in. For Plat 2+/Diamond etc we cannot guarantee or even define the quality of coaching you would receive as we only have a few coaches that would specialise in mentoring high ranked players. You are welcome to still apply and if you&#039;d be willing to share some of your time coaching lower elo students while receiving that would be an added double bonus (teaching others helps your own understanding AND helps us out). \n\n- If you join you&#039;d have the option to stick to one coach or a handful - the option is all yours. \n\n- It is a long-term program so you&#039;d be expected to be active and following the advice of your coaches. For example ADMIN will check your OP.GG weekly to ensure you&#039;re playing enough ranked and sticking to your selected champions. We don&#039;t have time for wannabe casuals so if you don&#039;t have a shred of discipline we might not be the best place for you.\n\n- You would be able to and expected to book a minimum of one coaching session a week. They last about an hour and if you prove to be eager you&#039;ll usually be offered more ;)\n\n- Join our exclusive discord community where you can ask for league advice!\n\n- You would also have your own excel profile with all your details and a log section to track your progress and communicate any issues/absences that might occur while with us. \n\n\n\n#Applications are now closed!** We will be accepting more students in the near future but need to comb through this batch first!\n\n\n**If you would like to trial as a coach with us just fill out the above form as it will still give you extra info about our program and we&#039;ll get in touch with you.**\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFAQ:\n\n\n1. Are we REALLY free? Yes, all the coaches here are volunteers. Students pay by remaining consistent and giving us effort. As a student if you show us you **mean** it you&#039;ll get a ton of high quality coaching sessions 1 on 1. Unfortunately the odd student things that because we are free they can mess us around since they haven&#039;t invested any money. These are swiftly removed.\n\n2. What ranks are your coaches? They are all, or have been, Diamond+. We all know that there are plenty of coaches out there at lower ranks that might **know** more about analysing and coaching but that&#039;s incredibly hard to verify compared.\n\n\n3. You don&#039;t get paid at all? Nope. Our website is in development so we get nothing on that end (in fact we are paying it out of our own pocket in combination with some amazing volunteers). We don&#039;t share any information or statistics. We are a very closed group that focus on coaching and improving compared to making $$ and marketing. \n\n4. How many students/coaches do you have? We have a cap of 100 students maximum and currently have around 40 that have been carefully selected. We have 15 coaches but will expand that to 30. Again a slow process since we don&#039;t accept anyone and everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"S1LAS","date":"2016-09-05T01:27:34.776+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submitted an application","replies":[]},{"poster":"LUD Bluesquare","date":"2016-09-12T08:38:34.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi iam looking into a coaching a player or a team that are low rank if u need some coaches","replies":[]},{"poster":"veo","date":"2016-09-05T10:00:51.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds interesting.","replies":[]}]}
