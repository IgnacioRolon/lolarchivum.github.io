I have the time, plus mechanics. I can follow instructions well and do not get salty. I have a mic and any comms program you need. \r\n\r\nNow a little about myself. My name is Lochie, 20 years old as of yesterday. Been playing this game for 3 years. Unemployed (been accepted into army, but wont be deployed for some time). I'm a very competitive player and yes, I do have that \"I'm as good as a diamond\" attitude sometimes because I want it. The dream was to become a pro gamer, but it is dead. I'm still trying even with little time I have left and I want to spend it on becoming the best version of myself in League. \r\n\r\nSo please, considered trialing me, sometime I can learn from it also (to see if I'm actually not high elo material)\r\n\r\nRole: ADC\r\nIGN: Dopa Apdo (can name change if required)\r\nPractice times: literally when ever.\r\nSome additional Contact Info: lochlan.brown@hotmail.com","replies":[{"poster":"catch this work","date":"2014-12-05T23:11:25.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, you're free to join my mates team.
