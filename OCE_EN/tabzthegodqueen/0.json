This makes no sense at all, I warded the most, didn&#039;t die, had 3 turret last hits and even did more damage to enemy champs than our Zed but can&#039;t get an S. Frustrating as hell how hard it is to get the last S I need to finish off my Nami mastery, surely the average Nami player isn&#039;t out there farming it up?","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-11-28T00:40:22.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL, i got less kda overall and was getting S+, feelsbadman\n\nHit level 7 within 4 games (1 was a loss)","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-11-27T21:17:39.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lmao, try full AP nami in ARAM and see how easy it is to get an S.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-27T13:19:44.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The average nami, due to being a support, doesn't have her grade get affected by CS","replies":[]}]}
