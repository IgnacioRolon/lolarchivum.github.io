I have a few idea&#039;s that could be taken on board, for different champions, that can still represent our region specifically. \r\n\r\n- Octopus Vel&#039;Koz {an obvious one}\r\n- Coral Thief Zyra {instead of thorns, using coral and seaweed}\r\n- Manatee Bard? {clearly this is a stupid thought, but who knows}\r\n- Fisherman Wukong or Yorick{fishing rod as his stick?}\r\n- Polar Bear Volibear {probably not a great one}\r\n\r\nOnly ideas but I feel as if the oceanic region can be brought out more, if the skin was connected more to its marine life. And even if you want it to still be for charity, it can go towards charities who try to preserve places like the Great Barrier Reef.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think? If it ever were to change should it be more Oceanic? I don&#039;t know much I&#039;m just a simple man.","replies":[{"poster":"Realm","date":"2015-10-20T04:30:06.015+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stupid idea... Oceanic region doesn't necessarily represent the ocean, the Southern Cross pretty much nailed it. It does represent the ocean in some aspects, but what about the people that live in the centre of Australia? They can't experience the ocean and nowhere near as often, so that idea wouldn't resonate well with them, the Southern Cross was a safe option that seemed to work, just a shame it's on a champ that isn't currently in the meta; Kassadin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-10-20T08:28:43.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oceania does have some tries to the ocean, but what's going to set \"Octopus Vel'Koz\" apart from every other ocean/water themed skin out there? e.g Pool Party skins, Coral Reef Malphite, Deep Terror Thresh... etc.\n\nIt's not very unique is it? But how many skins have a star constellation? One.","replies":[]}]}
