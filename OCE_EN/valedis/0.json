I really want to know.  THANK YOU~~~\nOh by the way i just wanna mention that Riot has 2 teams of champion rework now, so i guess these two completed reworked champions will be released at one time, expecting it already.(even i dun main evelynn and urgot)\nFinally i just wanna say my thinking about Riot&#039;s progress of champion rework and new champion creation,you guys are doing things slowly, can you pls do it faster so i can enjoy my expected new mage champion?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-22T14:22:11.888+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not how the schedules work. For champions and for reworks, they're ready when they're ready. There's a reason Riot don't give specific dates, and that's because ultimately it's a creative process, and is therefore subject to quality controls, all sorts of roadblocks on the kit/tech/art/anims/SFX etc along with the usual developmental costs.\n\nAlso, last release was TWO champions, so ofc things are going to be a little slow after that.\n\ntl;dr - they're ready when they're ready, not before, and not on any kind of finite schedule.\n\nAlso, very unlikely to get a comment in less than 10 minutes. There just aren't that many people on OCE boards. I think you should exercise a little patience, both for the reworks and here on boards.","replies":[{"poster":"valedis","date":"2017-05-22T14:27:06.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi i have read all u wrote just now, i found what you typed is probs making sence, yeah there might be some blocks on the road or something  not simple to overcome or maybe the progress is not always finished on time follow the schedule. So i guess i am gonna wait for this for a while....by the way i really expect the coming new mage champion XD!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"valedis","date":"2017-05-22T14:18:45.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL still no comments? \nI hope a official stuff of Riot OCE branch institution will answer me this question","replies":[]}]}
