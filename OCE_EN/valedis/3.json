And also, i really want to know the in-game model of riven and yasuo&#039;s {{champion:157}} {{champion:92}} new skin. i cannot wait and i dun want to wait anymore, i have waited enough riot. to be honest The only thing that keeps me playing league is new champions but riot just cannot make some champions which can really draw my attention that make me have a feeling that i would definitely main it/her/she once she/he/it is released. Hoping riot can make a new champion which is fun enough that keeps me want to play this game. or maybe i may just feel disappointed.(The past few champions are just not my style i like mage and fighter champions more and they must look cool enough and they have op abilities and kit.etc.)\r\n\r\n2: The icon of items{{item:1038}} {{item:1052}} {{item:3174}} {{item:3009}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3060}} {{item:3010}} {{item:1029}} {{item:1031}} {{item:3136}} {{item:3155}} {{item:3146}} {{item:3152}} {{item:3145}} {{item:3139}} {{item:3111}} {{item:1057}} {{item:1058}} {{item:3115}} {{item:3042}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3190}} {{item:1036}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3140}} {{item:3089}} {{item:1033}} {{item:3044}} {{item:1043}} {{item:2053}} {{item:3027}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3211}} {{item:3057}} {{item:3101}} {{item:3075}} {{item:3091}} {{item:3083}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3086}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3085}} {{item:1011}} {{item:1004}} {{item:1004}} {{item:3028}} {{item:1018}} {{item:3102}}  in league really should be updated as they look very old, so can Riot just make effort on doing that?  I guess your company has grown to a bigger company which can handle this kind of thing and technology  after nearly 10 years development, right?\r\n\r\n3: Seriously, when can be more outdated champions reworked within a year like between 6 and 10 maybe?({{champion:32}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:56}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:28}} ), i really want to know how long should it takes to totally rework an outdated champion and can Riot just post a list which tells us the rework champions list in the next few years so i can expect something instead of knowing nothing and this feels bad man, i do not like this feeling.\r\n\r\n4: The icon of in-game mouse which mean the mouse you control in summoner&#039;s Rift, to be honest Riot, it looks outdated as well, maybe you guys can updated the in-game mouse sometime so these can make this game looks beautiful and fastidiousness?","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-05-30T20:26:17.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Let's say it does take Riot 2-3 months to make a champion... *they just released TWO* a short while ago. At least give them some more time. \n\n2. I'm pretty sure there are already some item icon changes on the PBE (i.e. GA). \n\n3. Ryze recently had a rework.","replies":[{"poster":"Ceness","date":"2017-05-31T08:13:15.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. There's been a small teaser for a new champion, apparently similar to Akali and Diana but with Lightning powers. But this has been denied by Rioters.\n2. Why did you put Protobelt and Raptor Cloak in there? Both pretty new items. Anyway, they chose not to update all icons at once to limit the amount of confusion, personally not too sure how much it affects anyone but whatever.\n3. There is an actual Upcoming Changes page https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202294884-Champion-Update-Schedule. It hasn't got too much detail in it though. Urgot and Eve are getting full-scale reworks, as you know, some of the ones you've put up on the list have had minor reworks just to make them a bit better (E.g. Amumu and Udyr)\n4. They have already stated that they're going to be replacing the mouse cursor, doesn't seem to be high on their priority list as it's not that impactful","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-05-30T23:02:47.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah hurry the fuck up with an urgot teaser already.
