They have dedicated plans for champion teasers and releases that really try to give you (our players) the most enjoyment.

And also, i really want to know the in-game model of riven and yasuo's   new skin. i cannot wait and i dun want to wait anymore, i have waited enough riot. to be honest The only thing that keeps me playing league is new champions but riot just cannot make some champions which can really draw my attention that make me have a feeling that i would definitely main it/her/she once she/he/it is released. Hoping riot can make a new champion which is fun enough that keeps me want to play this game. or maybe i may just feel disappointed.(The past few champions are just not my style i like mage and fighter champions more and they must look cool enough and they have op abilities and kit.etc.)\n\n2: The icon of items                                                   in league really should be updated as they look very old, so can Riot just make effort on doing that? I guess your company has grown to a bigger company which can handle this kind of thing and technology after nearly 10 years development, right?\n\n3: Seriously, when can be more outdated champions reworked within a year like between 6 and 10 maybe?(                     ), i really want to know how long should it takes to totally rework an outdated champion and can Riot just post a list which tells us the rework champions list in the next few years so i can expect something instead of knowing nothing and this feels bad man, i do not like this feeling.\n\n4: The icon of in-game mouse which mean the mouse you control in summoner's Rift, to be honest Riot, it looks outdated as well, maybe you guys can updated the in-game mouse sometime so these can make this game looks beautiful and fastidiousness?","replies":[]},{"poster":"valedis","date":"2017-05-23T16:33:22.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does Riot ever thinking about making new PROJECT skins plan?
