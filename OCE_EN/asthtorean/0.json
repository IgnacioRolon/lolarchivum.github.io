I have a g74sx, its a model up from yours and it runs league really well, on max settign etc, its already 3 years old itself, yours might be a little older. I bought mine in 2012 for over 3g (NZD) back then, so you can appreciate how much they went for brand new. \nIt will be a good buy for LOL. \nJust check the screen resolution is 1080p as some arn't. There are many varients to the G73jh model. I have 1080p at 120 hertz, as i got the 3d model. It goes great and i'd imagine the g73jh would as well. (Just ask if it has been overclocked, as it was a higher end gaming laptop in its day).","replies":[{"poster":"Asthtorean","date":"2015-05-28T07:35:02.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response man!
