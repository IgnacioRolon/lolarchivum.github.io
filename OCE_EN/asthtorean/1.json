It got to 3-1 and apparently my last friend didn't vote, yet he said when the surrender timer got to 0 a \"Surrender vote successful, 4-1\" message came up without him pressing anything, or the last green light even appearing, so we lost the game. Is this possible?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-26T01:47:14.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Surrendering bot games is the best, though.\n\nI've never had this happen to myself. I know that if a player is 'disconnected' then only three votes are need to surrender, but obviously the player wasn't. It would be really frustrating if this happened in a real game.","replies":[]}]}
