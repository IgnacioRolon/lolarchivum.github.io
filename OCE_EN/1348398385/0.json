He is the only champion that can spawn different type of minions and just imagine in like now days when you have a rage blade master yi on your team and ult him in a team fight, that&rsquo;s crazy right. I start playing this game in season 5 and I find yorick very interesting to play since he is easy to play. But I wasn&rsquo;t perfect at him, like I didn&rsquo;t use a ghost do block skill shot at that time. And now I am just pretty disappointed when I look back at this game{{item:3070}} {{sticker:cass-cry}}","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2018-04-29T22:13:42.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"New Yorik is a much better champ though.

Like he's ult which is coming back from dead","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2018-04-30T01:04:28.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not fit as in thematically. Fit as in they weren’t useful in the game. New yorick is a split pusher that can duel you if he has ghouls up. What was old yorick good at? \n\nSure his ghouls were an annoying in lane but after that they aren’t going to bring impact to a team fight like other top laners will. And his ult while cool was not that useful.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AuraMax","date":"2018-04-29T20:40:02.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They brought LeBlanc and Ahri back to original state so Yorick may have hope.\n\nBut tbh there's too many hypercarries atm that need nerfs: xayah and kaisa.
