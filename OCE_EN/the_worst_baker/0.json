Lots of people in Bronze have started realizing that the best way to get out of bronze is to **listen**. People in silver however mostly refuse to communicate, as they think they are better than everyone just for being in silver. This is Ironic however as I am also in silver. And I am the best.","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-07-07T09:05:39.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^\n\ntl;dr Silvers think they're on a higher level than bronze.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bby Rengo","date":"2015-07-10T01:32:17.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Carry them with your skill?\nAdd me if u want to get better","replies":[{"poster":"The Worst Baker","date":"2015-07-10T03:26:44.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"added","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Worst Baker","date":"2015-07-09T02:09:03.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well what will your tips be to get higher in silver people say Amumu is freelo","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-07-07T13:48:07.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People make mistakes at every level.
