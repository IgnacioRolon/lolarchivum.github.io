It&#039;s getting to a point now where im getting a non english player per game and its hard to communicate with them.\r\n\r\nRiot should do something about this soon i know they are busy with the Pre-season changes which im excited for! but a comment from a Rioter with their opinion will leave me happy.\r\nOnce again not pointing fingers or trying to be racist just saying what ive seen over the past few months","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-11-25T03:34:08.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or the famous cao ni ma sha bi.. it's not just recent. They've been infecting the server for probs about 2 years now.\n\n 9.5times out of 10 they're salty and have one way to play the game. If anything else happens; they feed. Basically tell them that their mothers are of great stock and you would be happy to engage them in cunnilingus. It'll make them happy and is actually considered a compliment in China. Therefore play 10x better in the game and stop feeding as 0-6 Riven. :) Happy compliments!","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-11-24T22:00:41.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so get rid of them kk","replies":[]}]}
