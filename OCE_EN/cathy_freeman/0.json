There have been some recent issues with the transition between logins. If simply pressing login doesn't work, try either logging out of boards before logging into support, or open the support page in an incognito tab and you should be able to login.\n___\nFor your issue, I'd recommend updating graphics card drivers, and doing a *clean* reinstall (if you haven't already) using the Hextech Repair Tool: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool\n\nIf that doesn't work support is your best bet as I'm not sure what else might help you.","replies":[{"poster":"Cathy Freeman","date":"2018-04-28T06:39:46.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Already done everything you've suggested\nHad to get a friend to send an email to the support team for me, I couldnt get through\n\nhopefully they can help fix the issue, doing my head in\nthanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-03T05:46:45.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are two current workarounds for the support login issue (if you still need them):\n\n1: Open the support page in an incognito/private window and follow the process as normal, pressing the login button when prompted.\n\n2: Log out of the website **from the support page**, and then follow the process as normal, pressing login when prompted.\n___\n\nIf your support page has the blank \"OC\" login in the top right, you're good to go. If it only has your summoner icon with \"OCEANIA\" it means the support page is seeing you as logged in on the website and not in support. You need to follow one of the steps above.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
