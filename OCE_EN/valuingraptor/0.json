Why doesn&#039;t blind pick have this option?  I have seen complaints far and wide about insta-lockers, to people who dodge because they didn&#039;t get their desired role.  Are there reasons that are not as obvious to why the role selection option is not available for blind pick.\n\nAnother thing, why is there no way to report players during champ select?  When people are rude, or say unspeakable things.  We can not report them, instead we have to play a whole game with that player/players and then report them at the end.\n\nMaybe I am just ignorant to the ways of how Riot chooses to manage their player traffic, but I think at minimum the role selection for blind pick would be much appreciated by many.\n\nPlease vote in the poll.

I guess the Q times will be longer than a non role selection game.

Rather, the solution is to replace the standard Blind Pick system with a \"banless\" Draft Pick system. That way, \"Call Order\" (as it's commonly known) will make way for \"Pick Order\", which is superior in that it provides some kind of order to the chaos that exists in unranked games, rather than being based solely on who can type the fastest and who has the lowest ping (and potentially, who is using macros).","replies":[]}]}
