When the role section system first came out people asked for it. Basically 90% of people excluded Support which then led to an increase in queue times by like 700% or some bs. So Riot scrapped it and instead said they would focus on \"making support fun\".\n\nhttps://www.riftherald.com/culture/2016/9/30/13125180/lol-role-selection-position-preference","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-08-12T10:49:22.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I just feel like adding an \"avoid\" (or, rather, \"non-preferred\") option alongside the two preferred options would go a long way to creating a better experience for everyone. It would allow players to avoid one position that they're particularly bad at (jungle for me, I will do anything but jungle), and give the matchmaking algorithms more info to work with when trying to match teams. It *may* have a negative impact on queue times, particularly in \"low population\" scenarios, but that's no reason not to give it a trial at least. After all, it may just work.","replies":[]}]}
