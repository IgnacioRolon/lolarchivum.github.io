Just making a quick inquiry on how the server is in terms of load or generally how it&#039;s been for the last hour. Since the first two ranked games of the day were fine, perfect. No lag whatsoever.\r\n\r\n...Then my third game, had THIS. https://www.dropbox.com/s/ngkt966sclgaaeo/FIXRIOT.png?dl=0\r\n\r\nAnd before you ask, no, it wasn&#039;t the problem on my end. My connection was fine for the first two games. Even running connection tests and uploading that link worked perfectly. One of my team-mates dropped because of similar connection issues.\r\n\r\nSo, yes, I kind of would like an answer as to the state of the server for the last hour, if at all possible. Sorry for taking up your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Omega Overlord","date":"2015-05-22T12:22:52.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, well it's only really started to get this severe from what I can tell.

In 30 minutes, it doesn't go below 10K ping. \n\nIn a bot match.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-28T10:47:03.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dunno.

For weeks now people have been getting lag spikes when they shouldn't have and others being completely disconnected from games for no reason.\n\nSo yes, I'd say the servers are unhealthy at the moment.","replies":[]}]}
