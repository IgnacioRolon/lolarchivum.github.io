I am aware that I should go to the store, and click on the account icon, but it does not display anything except &quot;Change Summoner Name&quot;. I also read on a thread that this issue was going to be fixed after the 20th of November, but it still has not. I have not been able to play league of legends for a month, and I am on a study break, so please tell me what the issue is, and when the option of transferring will be available again.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-11-25T14:43:25.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">UPDATE\n\n>There's no easy way to say this. Server transfers were supposed to come back online this week, but we hit a snag in the new transfer service and have to delay this. We ran into some issues with how our data centers communicate with each other, and our engineers estimate it will take at least 5 to 6 weeks to be fixed.\n\n>I'll update this post again when we have more news.\n\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/f6bvYNQx-updated-transfers-disabled-from-sep-14th-to-nov-21st","replies":[]}]}
