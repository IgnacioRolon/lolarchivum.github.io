I tried to play again today and found that the issue was not resolved by any new patches or anything so I&#039;m here to see whether anyone can help me out.\n\nAfter logging in and entering the main game client, my whole computer will lag/freeze completely for about 10 seconds or so. There are then no other issues while in game lobby.\n\nIn game, my client tends to momentarily blank out and display a &#039;DVI Monitor not detected&#039; message on the black screen before returning to the game about 5 seconds later. This occurs throughout whole games and tends to become more frequent as the game progresses. While playing today, the client crashed altogether, resulting in a bugsplat. After I reopened the client, it actually stated that I had corrupt files and begun to scan for issues. I thought that this would fix the problem but as soon as I reconnected to the game, the error repeated itself.\n\nBesides this issue, the actual gameplay itself is still very smooth. Also, my graphics card is up to date if that helps at all.\n\nThanks in advanced.\n\nEDIT: Graphics card is Intel(R) HD Graphics 4000","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-05T14:09:25.018+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does this happen to any other games that make use of your graphics card? If so, it could mean you need to repair/change your graphics card. Is it still under warranty?\n\nCould you run a dxdiag? Press Ctrl+R and type in \"dxdiag\", then screencap the \"Display\" tab and upload it as an attachment here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"vubby","date":"2015-06-06T02:56:43.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure about other games as LoL is the only game I've tried to play in the past 6 months.\n\nPossibly could be due to a hardware error I guess, I changed my graphics settings down to medium and it seemed to reduce the frequency of this error. I also sat in a custom game alone and it was okay so maybe it is due to higher intensity.\n\nI don't think my graphics card is still under warranty but here is the dxdiag (wasn't able to load the attachment but here is a link of screencap)\nhttp://gyazo.com/d9c54fe4749033ddc731b4386e8975d2\n\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-10T10:59:26.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't trust random links, sorry.
