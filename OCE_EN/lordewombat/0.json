When I just tried to do this on 8.10, it still shows up as a normal hextech chest instead of a Masterwork one. Can any Rioter comment about whether the gemstone will be turned into the Masterwork chest regardless? And does it come with a key as well?","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-05-18T11:17:23.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I traded in 5 of my gemstones.\n\nAll 5 gave me regular looking chests however they all gave me non-champion shards. 1 emote and 4 skins.\n\nI don't know if I was just lucky or if its simply a visual bug and they are in fact Masterwork chests.\n\nYes they had keys.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-18T13:56:22.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I know the masterwork change only came in this patch (yesterday) so I wouldn't be surprised if it's a visual bug in your case, but it wasn't yet a thing in the OPs.","replies":[]}]}]}
