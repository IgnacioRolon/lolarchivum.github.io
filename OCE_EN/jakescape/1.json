Although it&#039;s not quite lag, I think it&#039;s packet loss however i&#039;m not sure. In game at all times of the day life bars seem to go down without any reason and I seem to be not able to move around but my ping is still at the normal 70-80. This has only started the last week or two, before that I had no lag and this in particular never happened. I&#039;m really confused and i&#039;m trying to figure out whether it&#039;s the server, my mac, my router or my ISP.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m running OSX Yosemite 10.10.3, I have a Belkin router and my ISP is Exetel. About a month or two ago I changed ISPs to Exetel however this didn&#039;t happen then, also I upgraded to Yosemite before this all happened so i&#039;m almost sure it&#039;s not my mac or the ISP (even though exetel is not the best). I tried to use the LoLTR tool however it said when running that there was an unrecognisable command in line. I attached 2 screenshots, 1 being the LoLTR error and one being me trying to traceroute the OCE server. I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s the right IP, the OCE server IP is not in the troubleshooting page but it was in a text document on my desktop after I ran the LoLTR tool. The second screenshot is a the second IP that was given in the doc.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve tried to restart my router multiple times, restart my mac, uninstall recently install applications, block every device on my network except my mac, have nothing open except League, changing the DNS to Googles, turned both my router firewall and my mac firewall off as well as updating my mac even though no updates are related. Soon I plan on buying a new router and splitter to see if I get a better ping however i&#039;m wondering why this is happening now for no apparent reason\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll make clear this happens randomly from ANY time of the day whether it be morning, afternoon or 3am in the morning. It.. doesn&#039;t happen &#039;often&#039; meaning that 1 in 10 games it happens or so, but it could happen more often sometimes all day and when it happens, it&#039;s basically unplayable and i&#039;m forced to leave and face a temp ban most times this happens as it doesn&#039;t stop until I end up finishing the game. I&#039;ll also add that when this happens, my internet seems to stop working and i&#039;ll have to restart my router for it to work again and that leads me to think it&#039;s the router. It&#039;s relatively old being about 3 years or so and had a few bumps every now again but it was fine previously. \r\n\r\nSorry for the wall of text, but this is a pretty big deal as getting temp banned because of it and not knowing when it happens is something I don&#039;t wanna have to deal with it. Any more information you need to help with this, i&#039;ll be happy to add.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-27T12:00:16.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you experienced any sort of lag while doing other internet related activities? eg. webpages occasionally taking ages to load, or packet loss in other games.

Webpages do take a bit longer than usual to load during peak times (even though we're on an unlimited plan) but at other times of the day daily browsing is fine but League still does it. Other game I play is Robocraft and I try to play that game after this happens and I can play perfectly.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-28T11:12:54.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've already tried the majority of things you should try.
