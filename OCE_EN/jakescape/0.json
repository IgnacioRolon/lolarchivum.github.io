I don&#039;t think it was deserved honestly. It&#039;s like someone taking your wallet and then you having a go at him then you getting punished for telling him he had a bad upbringing. Not one swear was said. Not to mention he wasn&#039;t  even level 30 yet and I had no previous convictions AND I was honor 4. But I digress about my rant about this system being broken, how long does it take to get start again? I&#039;ve been getting constant honors and not got off honor 1. I&#039;m not even fussed about the chat ban, although unwarranted, i&#039;m fussed about the fact I can&#039;t get rewards simply because of this. Someone who doesn&#039;t care about the game hence why he trolled, reports me and now i&#039;m still being punished weeks later? It feels like going to jail for weeks just for jaywalking. \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve looked at other posts similar and can&#039;t get a clear answer, all I can see are people agreeing with me that this new honor system is trash if you slip up once which most of us do.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2017-12-27T08:39:08.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There isn't a set number of honors you need to level up. \n\nSome people get chat restricted then unlock their honor back quicker than others.\nIt comes down to your behavior in game. Even if you are receiving consistent honor, if people are reporting you and the reports are found to be valid (even if they don't result in a punishment) you wont go up. \n\nJust stop worrying about it and ensure that your chatlogs/in game behaviour remain neutral or positive and you'll be back to honorable in no time. \n\n*(Note: honor does reset for everyone at the start of the new season and you will have a clean slate then)*","replies":[]}]}
