Taking the same spells every time, regardless of matchup is a very bronze thing to do.\n That's just my silver and my platinum coach's 2cents on the matter.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-10-04T09:44:33.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, its a neat idea but there are a lot of other things higher on the list before this.\n\nLike the ability to reorder your rune and mastery pages without deleting and remaking.

If anything they might have taken the wrong runes or masteries but summoners is a hard mistake to make and draft pick gives you more than enough time to check your runes, masteries and especially summoners.
