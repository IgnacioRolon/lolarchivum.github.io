I have realized it is ok to put time into it. Ok it is a fun game.\r\n\r\nBut do not put money into it, as at any time, they can just perma ban your account. And you lose everything. \r\n\r\nLosing the time isn&#039;t so bad. You were going to keep playing it anyway. But losing the money is just a kick in the face. And they seem to just perma ban people at random. I know of atleast 3 people who have been banned, even tho they did not break &quot;community rules&quot;\r\n\r\nThe way their report system works is, if enough people report you after a game. No one looks at it. It is all automated. Play bad in a team of premade players. They all report you. And you get punished because they didn&#039;t like you.\r\n\r\nSo again. Put your time into this game. But not your money.","replies":[{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2018-03-27T09:31:26.192+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plz don’t tell bs lies. 99% of the time the players getting banned deserve it.

Except  I can't seem to get the attention of an actual human to review the case. It's just an automated system. But thank you for agreeing with me that it does happen.\n\nI'm just glad that most of the RP I spent on this game was purchased using mobile phone credit, that would have otherwise gone to waste. \n\nPerma banning peoples accounts just seems a bit over the top. Especially over players just not liking eachother.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-03-27T16:14:36.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">The way their report system works is, if enough people report you after a game.

It only takes 1 report to review someone's chat logs. It was likely designed this way specifically to avoid the situations you described.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iloveyoubabygirl","date":"2018-03-29T05:24:08.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"riot owe me about 300-400 dollars + time compensation for perma banning me over an issue they have an literal inbuilt function to address being the mute button\n\nWHERE THE FUCK do you get off thinking you are some sort of social judgement or justice JESUS CHRIST\n\nomerta DCLXVI","replies":[{"poster":"Honey Bunny","date":"2018-04-03T22:39:26.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Iloveyoubabygirl,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=swpV80pG,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2018-03-29T05:24:08.031+0000)\n>\n> riot owe me about 300-400 dollars + time compensation for perma banning me over an issue they have an literal inbuilt function to address being the mute button\n> \n> WHERE THE FUCK do you get off thinking you are some sort of social judgement or justice JESUS CHRIST\n> \n> omerta DCLXVI\n\nSee, another person who got banned wrongly. Believe me it happens a lot. \n\nI'm just letting people know, at any time you can lose your account, and all the work you have put into it. If someone had informed me before I started playing this game. You can get perma banned for no reason. I wouldn't have put once cent into it.\n\nI'm just trying to warn other people is all.","replies":[]}]}]}
