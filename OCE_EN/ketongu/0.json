It would be great to hear what you think of the champions lore, abilities and balance and which lane(s) you could see this champion being played in if he was made. Thanks!\n\n****Ghord, the Turret Cleaver****\n(a melee AP off-Tank with mana)\n\n**Lore**\nEven from a young age Ghord intrigued and, mostly, worried those close to him due to both his unusually high magical power and his love of destroying things; anything. This magic power, coupled with his mystically infused warhammer, a family heirloom passed down through the generations led to him having the ability to demolish entire fortresses single-handedly. In fact, every structure in Runeterra had ceased to be a challenge to destroy. As such, upon hearing from many that the turrets in the League are the most sturdy and dangerous structures in all of Runeterra, he joined the League, seeking the challenge of destroying them, accompanied by four abilities, which he named after the four things he believed to be most important in life.\n\n**Abilities**\n\nPassive - Turret Love\nAll abilities can be used on turrets and Ghord will become invincible for 5 seconds and gain 100 extra gold after a turret is destroyed.\n\nQ - Melt Metal  (5)\nSkill shot with damage scaling with AP and ability level and snare time scaling with ability level. Ghord swings his hammer in an arc in front of him as it briefly glows red and sends out fire and molten metal in front of it. Any enemies close enough to him to be hit by the hammer will only be damaged but any enemies further away from him will be held in place by the molten metal, receiving the same damage but also being snared for a short time.\n\nW - Persevere (5)\nResist 10/15/20/25/30% of all incoming damage (even from turrets) for a short time (also scaling slightly with AP). Upon casting, his hammer will glow blue until it wears off or another ability is cast.\n\nE - Crush Stone (5)\nSingle target melee attack with damage scaling with AP and ability level. Ghord lifts his purple glowing hammer above his head and smashes it down upon a target dealing damage and, if the target is a champion, minion or monster, stunning the target for a short time. If the target is a turret, it will stop attacking for the same period. The smash will also send out a shockwave, dealing minor damage to nearby enemies in a circular area of effect.\n\nR - Destroy Everything (3)\nSkill Shot with damage scaling with AP and damage and stun time scaling with level. With a booming laugh, Ghord smashes his green glowing hammer into the ground, causing it to shatter into 5 green glowing chunks of stone, which he then shoots separately in straight line skill shots which will hit the first champion or turret they touch by reactivating his ultimate up to five times. The fifth will be bigger, dealing more damage and travelling through champions up to its maximum range. Each enemy hit will be debuffed with 'Destroyed' which stuns the target for a duration based on the percentage of hit shards which targeted them; the greater this percentage is, the lower the stun time will be. (NOTE: This is to encourage use in team fights as it has the capacity to cripplingly stun the entire enemy team if used expertly)  For the duration of his ultimate, Ghord is locked in place and can not use other abilities but enemies near to him get damage based on how many shards he hasn't fired yet (the more shards, the more damage). As this ultimate seems very powerful, it would have a very long cool down.\n\nAgain, give me your thoughts, suggestions and so forth about this champion concept! :D\n\nP.S. If you want me to post some quotes reflecting my imagined personality of this champion as well, then just ask in the comments.","replies":[{"poster":"MrButter","date":"2014-12-18T10:36:54.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I must admit, i absolutely love the champion idea, but i agree that the stuns are a bit excessive. maybe change some to a slow or something. As for the invincibility passive i would recommend either reducing it to 3 seconds or removing it and putting in a Health Regen or Armour increase.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aedridon","date":"2014-12-16T01:27:13.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, great champion concept. There aren't many champions who can interact with turrets. Rammus, Alistar, Janna and Azir. I think that's it. So a champion whose abilities can all interact with enemy or ally turrets is pretty sweet. However, there are a few problems. \n\nLet's go into his ult first. 5 stuns. C'mon, thats a lot. Even if the duration is lesser for every consecutive hit, if you lock the apc or adc in place, you have a high chance of winning the teamfight. Adding his e, u technically have 6 stuns. And additionally, he's channeling it. Interrupt it, that's a cc gone down the drain. He's also a tank. He has to go in. And if he goes in, he'll get cced. If he stands back to shoot his ult, he's kinda not following the role of a tank. Unless he has some sort of dash to shoot his ult and immediately jump into the fight. \n\nNext, his w. It blocks turret damage. That'll help him tower dive at early levels and get out alive with a kill, even if it's just 10%. Build armour and even the turret isn't safe for the enemy laner. What's more, it scales with ap. I don't know how much but it'll make the ability even more op. \n\nHis e is an ohmwrecker. I hope the cooldown is going to be big. I suggest making the cooldown longer when it hits a turret and shorter when it hits a minion, monster or champion. \n\nYup, that's all I have to say. In a nutshell, I think this is a good champion concept but he needs a few tweaks here and there. Hope to see your next update","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jayhawk","date":"2014-12-15T00:37:33.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy mother of broken OP %%%%...\n\nWhat kind of champion gets 3 stuns (Two that can hit more than one target), gets a 30% damage reduction ability that up-scales with AP, a 5 second invulnerability passive which grants bonus gold, the ability to use abilities directly on tower and AP scaling on all damage abilities?\n\nThis guy would be OP regardless of how much you nerf him, no one deserves that amount of control over a fight.\n\nSorry, I can't buy into this champ at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Area2609","date":"2014-12-14T17:13:27.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice champion idea!","replies":[]},{"poster":"420 Afgooey","date":"2014-12-14T13:34:38.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is awesome, maybe make his passive different effects depending on which colour your hammer is just a suggestion, either way i would love this champ haha","replies":[]}]}
