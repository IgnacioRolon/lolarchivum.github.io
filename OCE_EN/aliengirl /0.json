You are held to the same standards as everyone else. You aren't expected to act as if everyone is sunshine and rainbows, but you are expected **not** to engage in negative behaviour, regardless who starts it. This is also why only your own chat logs are used in the reform card, because it is *your* behaviour (not the behaviour of others) that is relevant to *this* case.\n\nAs far as your chat logs go, it's certainly not good. It's a constant string of negative comments, from giving up, to insulting others, to threatening to intentionally lose the game. As far as one match goes, I'm not sure whether this would be enough to trigger a chat restriction, but if this is the kind of behaviour you exhibit to any significant degree, then it makes sense that you would receive such a punishment.\n\nKeep in mind, this is the lowest tier of punishment, and intended as a reminder that such behaviour is not acceptable within the community. This *should* act to put you on a path to addressing your own behaviour (something that *should* be within your own control), so that you can at least prevent yourself from acting out (which is the minimum anyone, not just Riot, would expect you to be capable of). If you continue such behaviour, you're likely to receive another chat restriction (25 games) and then proceed onto bans, as is the standard progression.\n\nIf you want to appeal the punishment, you will need to submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Discuss a personal suspension or restriction\" option) and go through the process with them. They will manually review the case, determine whether the punishment has been made in error, and act accordingly. Keep in mind that there is no guarantee anything will change about the punishment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-10-11T05:31:45.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Keeping in mind that Riots report system works by numbers. The more reports you have against you the more likely you will be punished when and if they deem an incident sever enough. I'm willing to bet that or those particular games you are referring to multiple people reported you as opposed to just you reporting them by yourself. In my experience you should always have a duo with you to report also if you want Riot to take you seriously.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-12T03:14:38.769+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Number of reports in a game doesn't matter, only a single report is needed to trigger a review of the game. \n\nWhat can affect you is a history of negativity (valid reports submitted against you but for behaviour that wasn't severe or consistent enough to warrant punishment), but I don't think that was necessarily the case here given it was only a 10-game restrict.","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-10-12T04:08:02.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find that hard to believe but ok.

No consideration for the other team members that didn't say anything. Then wonder why she got ban. What a JOKE! \n\nI would rather take a guy that lost lane to the point of looking like he is feeding, than someone that threaten AFK and commit to it after a comment or two. \n\nYea OP, keep typing abuse in chat, that will make what you are doing seem justify. \n\nI would wager that the other guy said something trivial like \"You're a bad player, cant gank for shit, or dont gank at all\" and such.
