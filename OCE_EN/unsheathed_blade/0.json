However, I think Riot should keep the shield passive and replace the double percent critical strike with a 3 hit passive, a favourite mechanic of Riots&#039; I guess and replace his Q skill with another skill. I also think his W was unique in a way which it can block many projectiles. It still had bugs though, for an instance, you could block a Nid spear when it was right infront of you but you can&#039;t block a TF gold cold. However if you can remove the bugs, the W is perfect and should stay the same, so basically like a controlled variable in a way. I think his E is perfect as well, for a student of the Wind, I guess it could fit his lack of mobility, otherwise if he didn&#039;t have it, he can&#039;t be an assassin. His R is also a unique skill since it can only be used against airborne targets. His ultimate is great but I think the visual effects are a little old school XD, ending it of with a third slash. I was thinking of like a rapid spin of Yasuo and rising his target up and slamming towards the ground(Sort of Like an Actual Tornado). The aftereffects are good buffs, mostly to shred the tank meta, so he should be able to keep it. So really, all I&#039;m asking is a rework on his Q and his 2nd passive which was the double percent so maybe rework that into a 3 hit passive. Anyway let me know, cya.","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2016-05-17T04:46:45.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If he needs a rework what should happen imo\nPassive:Remove the shield keep the crit\nW:Rework it into a spell shield (wind shield) type ability rather than a wall it should block crowd control effects from ranged abilities but only a percentage of ranged ability/aa damage (still a decent amount of it) allow him to cast the ability on another person instead of himself\nE:Fine\nR:Fine however riot should make only true knockups work for his ultimate not just anything that lifts someones model off the ground by more than a pixel\n\nthen give him more health and/or health regen early game","replies":[{"poster":"bloodmoth","date":"2016-05-18T00:31:31.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"crit bonus is awful, though if he were squishier it might force him to buy a tanky item before stacking crit and shitting all over everyone\n\nDisagree with W, it just needs its zone shrunk right the fuck down to a thin line instead of a big ass zone that can protect a 6 stack cho'gath and only block projectiles from the direction it faces, not from every angle. that would allow ranged champs to flank the wall and cause the skill to require better planning. The ability is hella thematic as it is, its just far too forgiving for bad placements, you can cast it in the wrong fucking direction and still block important spells.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"bloodmoth","date":"2016-05-18T00:26:39.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"W needs to be slimmed down, if i step to the side of it i should be able to strike past it, damn thing is so fat  its like it just protects anyone near it from everything. it should be as wide as it is but much thinner, and perhaps only block projectiles from one direction instead of both (so yas cant just be invincible by standing inside. the counterplay is pretty piss poor imo. The idea behind it is really cool, but i think the implementation is FAR too forgiving.\n\nCrit passive is horrible, not too sure what they can do about that though, maybe lower the crit bonus even further? its just free stats and causes him to powerspike far too hard. If crit damage was reduced to 70% that could be better, or fuck it, just make all his attacks crit but only do bonus damage = crit chance from items, as thats basically what it is.\n\nI personally hate that champ, just think he feels far too unfair to play against with his 4s immunity to ranged champs and stupid burst. Id be much happier with him if his damage pattern was more sustained than bursty (more ramp up) and his WW could be played around beyond \"walk away because you clearly cant do shit\". His thematics and identity are solid and all but holy hell is he frustrating.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nyeseth","date":"2016-05-16T12:20:13.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Passive** - Just remove the critical strike stuff, he can just have normal crits. His flow should also be his resource (at least for his wind wall and ultimate) it can still use it all for the shield when it is maxed, but he should have to be able to balance using his abilities and having that shield up, not being able to have both available at the same time. \n**Q** - Fine\n**W** - Fine\n**E** - Needs a proper cool down time, the fact that your own minions hinder you when trying to escape this champ through your own side of the lane lane is stupid. \n**R** - Fine, but could probably remove the 'Ignore 50% of your target's bonus armor' part.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-05-16T12:28:41.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Nyeseth","date":"2016-05-16T13:25:08.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm sorry, I wasn't aware that people cared about your opinion. \n\nThis is a place for discussions, whether you like the topic or not.
