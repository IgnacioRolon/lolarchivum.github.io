Thanks :D enjoy\n\n_**Introduction: **_\nI&#039;m not good at stories so I will just leave the story line/lore empty. But it would be best related to Zyra or/and Ahri.\n**Kualla** (I just use my game name for now) &ndash; was a big flower turned into living creature, she is cheerful but a little shy sometimes. She has a short blond (messy) hair, big shiny eyes and big ears with the shape of pointy spiky leaf. Her small body is covered with pink petals and always levitate around. Floating along with her is a big yellow flower, her weapon.\n\nRoles: Mage/support\n\n_**Abilities:**_\n\n**Passive: **\n(8s reset)\nWhoever use basic attacks on her will have 30% chance to get paralysed, which will root them for 0.5 second and reduce their magic resist for 10/20/30 (at lvl 6/11/16) in 3 seconds.\n\n**Q: Catch them **\n(12/11/10/9s cooldown)\nKualla&rsquo; flower shoots a seed forward, deals damage to minions on the way and strike at the first champion it touches, dealing 50(+30% ap) and stick on them. \nAfter 2 seconds the seeds grows into big thick vines that wrap around the enemy and root them for 1/1.12/1.5/1.75 seconds, deals 50(+30% ap) and heal that amount to Kualla.\nIf an ally damaged the champion when the seed was still brewing, they also get healed with the same amount.\n\n**W: Slash and slice** \n(10/9/8/7s cooldown) \nKualla&rsquo; flower creates a vortex of petals and leafs around her in 3 seconds (radius 500). \nThe vortex damages all enemies inside, deals 30(+35% ap) per second. \nAlso increase move speed for Kualla and all allies inside for 30%\n\n**E: Safe landing** \n(15/13/11/9s cooldown)\nKualla jumps to a **target enemy** and lands on her flower, damages enemies in a small area 70(+50% ap) and slows them (20/25/30/35%) in 2 seconds.\n\n**R: Flower Power** \n(110/100/90/80s cooldown)\nKualla&rsquo; flower grows big then she throws it to a location, spreads poisonous pollens to that area dealing damage to any enemies contacted 3 times in 3 seconds 20(+25% ap), 40(+50% ap), 60(+75% ap), also causing enemy champions add extra cooldown to their abilities for 5/7/9/11s, and their ult for 15/18/21/24s\n","replies":[{"poster":"Teemaister","date":"2016-03-22T02:03:05.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like Zyra{{champion:143}}  and Lulu{{champion:117}}  mixed in to one (from the design perspective) but I like it! :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-03-22T01:15:39.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"zyra.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-03-21T23:01:59.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting","replies":[]}]}
