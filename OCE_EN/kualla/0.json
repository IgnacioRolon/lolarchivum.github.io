Her face is emotionless, her fragile body is covered by pieces of glass like a shiny gown.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n**Passive**\r\nEverytime Mura receive or deal damage from abilities, she receives a shard of glass, can store up to 4 shards. he next basic attack consumes 1 shard and deal extra damage and apply bleeding for 3s.\r\n\r\n**Q**\r\nMura throws white mirror to targeted location, the mirror stay in the air and burst down a flare that blind the enemies on the ground for 1s (like Graves W but bright screen). After regain the vision, the &quot;flared&quot; enemies will see 2 reflections of Mura next to her (random position).\r\nThe reflections mirror every action Mura makes. They have all the stats just like the original, only dissapear after 5s or get impaired-movement CC that stop them from reflecting Mura, or Mura got CC herself.\r\n\r\n**W**\r\nMura shiled with the black mirror which absorbs the first projectile ability contact and hold it for 5s. Mura can recast again to release the exact ability with 50% of the original damage and CC duration (20% apply for ults).\r\n\r\n**E**\r\nMura put the black mirror on the standing ground and the wihite mirror at target location for 3s, she can travel back and forth through them.\r\n\r\n**R**\r\nMura leap a short distance to pointed enemy champion, on contact she shatters herself and transform into giant mirror walls that trap only the enemy she collided with for 4s . Noone can step in or out the mirror prison.\r\nOnce the prison formed, the enemy will see their very own true self, that entity reflects the enemy as if they are standing infront of a mirror, only this mirror reflection deals damage as they do. The reflection has half of the original stats (HP, Arm, AD,etc..)\r\nTo get out of the prison, either the enemy has to wait for 4s, or kill the reflection (since it deals half damage and 2 times faster to kill). Once the prison dissapear, Mura reforms at the reflection last location.\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nHer play strategy is to trade skills better enemies in laning phase. \r\nHer ult is to block out the tank and still keep herself safe and sound while her team charging to the backline, or positioning with W and E to get their main damage source.","replies":[{"poster":"BarneyIsComing","date":"2018-01-29T06:21:01.179+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"no","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-29T07:13:24.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I got as far as \"black and white mirrors\", and was like... does this person even know what a mirror is?","replies":[{"poster":"Kualla","date":"2018-01-29T07:35:12.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're welcome\n\nhttps://cdn.instructables.com/F4R/Q3M7/H1JUIIPI/F4RQ3M7H1JUIIPI.RECT2100.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-29T07:39:12.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kualla,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=E00Vilmt,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2018-01-29T07:35:12.793+0000)\n>\n> You&#x27;re welcome\n> \n> https://www.google.com.au/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.instructables.com%2FF4R%2FQ3M7%2FH1JUIIPI%2FF4RQ3M7H1JUIIPI.RECT2100.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.instructables.com%2Fid%2FMake-your-own-Claude-Glass-or-Black-Mirror%2F&amp;docid=sLBJVBnWNxLWIM&amp;tbnid=brA_oXS97TTJmM%3A&amp;vet=10ahUKEwjTy5iS1PzYAhVNhrwKHb5xDh0QMwiRAigGMAY..i&amp;w=1200&amp;h=800&amp;bih=900&amp;biw=1920&amp;q=a%20black%20mirror&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTy5iS1PzYAhVNhrwKHb5xDh0QMwiRAigGMAY&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8\n\nCool link bro.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-01-29T06:29:30.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No ... just no","replies":[]}]}
