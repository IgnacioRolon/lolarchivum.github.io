LoL is supposed to be free to pay with no pay-to-win, so having a gameplay influencing aspect (like runes) available via the purchasable currency (RP in the case of LoL) is counter-intuitive to a \"no pay-to-win\" scheme. That said, having rune pages available for RP is also (somewhat) counter-intuitive to a \"no pay-to-win\" scheme, but I would (personally) be happy if a rune page didn't cost more than the majority of champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-03-15T04:58:22.940+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is an RP bundle for rune pages, you can buy one for 590 RP or 7 for 2600.\n\nAs for the runes themselves, that is why tier 2 runes are 1IP each. They exist to fill out the pages with some stats until you can afford the slightly better stats.\n\nEDIT: As HeartVine mentioned, pay to win has NO place in League of Legends. Runes themselves should never EVER be able to be bought with RP. The pages I am fine with, since they are very expensive and still require a choice of where to put your IP, but the runes must remain IP only to preserve the truly ftp nature of the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2017-03-15T10:53:38.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have a freidn that has gotten to gold a few times wiht pages full of 1 ip runes, and an accidental ad brand. the runes dont matter as muich as you think.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-03-15T09:19:01.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are reworking runes around 7.10 anyway, changing the way they are bought and used.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-03-15T06:28:14.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Has 2 accounts\nhas 15 rune pages on one and 12 on the other\nall filled with tier 3\n\nWtf are you complaining about, i've been playing since S3 and even by the end of S3 i had 8 rune pages on my main.\n\nThink before you write, no one else has this issue\n\ninb4 you spent RP\ni have never wasted RP on a rune page, and on my other account i haven't spent any money on it whatsoever, just spam norms earn IP and stop complaining","replies":[{"poster":"gvuvuh2","date":"2017-03-15T06:48:04.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I apologise for not being a sweatbucket of a player and no lifing league to buy runes :)","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-03-15T08:22:28.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=gvuvuh2,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=KW40tiv9,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2017-03-15T06:48:04.959+0000)\n>\n> I apologise for not being a sweatbucket of a player and no lifing league to buy runes :)\n\nI don't no life, otherwise i'd be higher than a silver i play about 4 games a day at most that's 1k ip if all 4 are wins and 280ish if they're all losses its not expensive to get runes","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"gvuvuh2","date":"2017-03-15T06:06:47.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally think it would be a relief if I could buy the runes I need with RP, it was an effort climbing in diamond with only 2 rune pages(Ad & AP)","replies":[]}]}
