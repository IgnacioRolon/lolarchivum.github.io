When reinstalling the game, are you just double clicking on the install file?\n\nCould you try uninstalling the game once again and then when attempting to reinstall, right click the installer and select \"Run as Administrator\", it is possible there is a security setting on your PC preventing the installer from setting up all files needed for the game to run.","replies":[{"poster":"SammyTheDeadRat","date":"2017-04-13T06:34:57.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks but i already solved the problem, all i did was take libscrypto-1_1.dll from a friends computer and place the file into mine.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
