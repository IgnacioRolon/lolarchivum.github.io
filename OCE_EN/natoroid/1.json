Although Rito didn&#039;t bring him back with the other legacy skins (Big Bag/Feral WW) I recall hearing something vague about bringing him back under special circumstances. \r\n\r\nI have been having a lot of fun with WW (just got level 7 mastery!) and although I do like the tundra hunter skin, I reckon being able to get (what I believe to be) the best skin would be super cool!\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"BushMstr","date":"2017-02-11T09:13:04.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Grey WW isnt obtainable at all unfortunately, he was only able to get from the recruit a friend system, waaaayyyy back, when it was removed the skin became unavailable and will remain that way until Riot implement it back into the game\n\nSorry bud","replies":[{"poster":"Natoroid","date":"2017-02-12T01:20:14.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I thought that might be the case.
