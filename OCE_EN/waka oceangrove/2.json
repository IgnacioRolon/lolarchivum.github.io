He is most suited to adc or the midlane. He is in direct competition to Bard, an opposite in every way. Methlin is the essence of evil within the league of legends arena. One way he will have an individual feel as a champ is through his offensive passive presence. \r\nPassive: Presence: if a champ is within 675 range units of Methlin, he will wear down their health by 5 health per 30 seconds in range. (A coherent evil spirit that wants to corrupt everyone else.) \r\n\r\nQ: endless cavern - traps his opponents within the grasp of a evil conjurer for 2 seconds draining 60 magic damage. (+ 15/30/45/60/75 + 0.1 x ability power)\r\n\r\nW: no escape - Methlin conjures up three evil spirits to be sent out randomly over the map that will give sight of map and either heal ally champs or deal 45 true damage (45/60/75/100) to opponents \r\n\r\nE: uneasy - passive: whenever in combat, lowers the critical hit of opponents by 4%\r\n                   - active: sends a wave of fear over 500 range units and damages opponents by 70 magic damage (70/85/110/140/175)\r\n\r\nR: Crusade of damned- Conjures up 4 evil mimicking spirits of his allys and they will fight for Methlin for 30 seconds with their magic/attack damage being 3.5% of the mimicked ally&#039;s health and their health starting at 350 health at level 6 (+55 per level)","replies":[{"poster":"Whitesmoke","date":"2016-04-26T23:45:52.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like it, I hope Riot take notice of this and bring it out in patch 8.5 :-)","replies":[]}]}
