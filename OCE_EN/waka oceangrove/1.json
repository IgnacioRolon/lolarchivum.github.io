Has a 40 (40/30/25) second cool down \n\nQ. Horn thrust\nMana cost: 70/65/55/50/40\nActive: Gruff throws enemy champions up in the air for 0.75 seconds dealing 40 physical damage (40/55/60/70/80) + ( 1/3/5/7/10% of base health)\nIf struck with horn thrust while gruff is slowed from passive enemy is stunned for 1 second\nCooldown :18/16/12/10/6 seconds\n\nW: Stampede \nMana cost: 60/55/40/35/30\nPassive: Each time Gruff has his passive activated he gains 2 armour and magic resist ( can be stacked up to 8 times in 5 minutes \nActive: Gruff consumes his stacks and is given a aura of nature that shields him from 50/75/100/125/150 + ( 0.5 x base armour ) damage \nCooldown: 22/17/13/10/8\n\nE: Stomp\nMana cost : 50 at all ranks\nActive: Gruff stomps a enemy with his hoofs and slows them by 15%/20%/30%/35%/40% and deals 15/30/45/60/80 magic damage +(1x bonus ability power)\nCooldown : 10/9/8/7/6 seconds\n\nR: Mad Goat Rush\nMana cost : 100/80/65\nActive: Gruff gets consumed in a rage and sends himself a targeted area able to travel through terrain dealing 100/150/250  (+ 10% of bonus attack damage) AoE magic damage \n\nCooldown: 105/90/70 seconds \nRange 1000/2000/3500\n\nJust a very brief description which I really think riot should look at !! And give me a little credit üòé \nLord wise I think he should be loosely based on bill goat gruff of course as well as the goat Pokemon \nCheers for reading üòé also is 2nd cousins with Alistar\nhttps://lh6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/u_qZxyvKU9tQ9nhsnS_nAtOfzxrBhYAXOZCQ6YGCiAx6O7vE_M-WfyiGhiPw9dYyraaI9Ss1B66sVA4_iHX7h3pUCAZdefmsAJ4wHNJCPDRNxqr3x5y_fZTrg9jhjuTwge9bBLsJumj8Y8ce0py5LQsws6tCrPA=w363-h405-nc\n\nEdited: added mana cost and fixed the spelling of enemy üòé","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-09-15T12:40:34.966+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nReally cool concept!\n\nI love the work you have put into it, fleshing out the abilities and numbers a little. \n\nLooks like he is tanky and has some CC. aside from some numbers adjustments, I think he could be a viable champ (I actually think is passive is way to punishing, especially in lane)\n\nHowever one thing I would really like you to consider is, what makes this champion special? What kind of themes and background does Gruff have and how is that represented through his gameplay?\n\nHow do you want the player to feel when they play Gruff?\n\nand finally just a personal thing, I think ultimates should be extremely unique and personal to a champion. I assume at max level it has 3500 range (not 35000). The ultimate for Gruff is purely a long range AOE charge (similar to malphites but without the knock up and with range instead). Is there a unique mechanic that Gruff should be using (maybe even tied into his passive,like you have done with his q).\n\nBut overall definitely a cool concept.","replies":[{"poster":"Whitesmoke","date":"2018-07-10T06:26:28.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think there is definitely room for Gruff in this meta, now which isnt truly suited for pure tanks, but stealthy fighters with good cc. Talk to the people up top @Marauduar, its going to be good! Plus, {{champion:6}} needs someone to match his power xx","replies":[]},{"poster":"WAKA OceanGrove","date":"2015-09-15T19:12:21.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes indeed I meant 3500 ! üëç oh cheers for the advice will defiantly take it on board and review his themes, unique characteristics and overall feeling.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DoctorFoetus","date":"2015-09-16T15:17:20.070+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's cool that you're trying ideas for champions, but some details are missing. And he will suffer from some balance issues.\n\nTake this scenario for example, teemo auto attacks you 3 times. You recieve a slow bringing you to really low movement speed meaning you're almost a sitting duck for taking punishment.\n\nIs the Q a skill shot or targetted? Is the E a skillshot or targetted? How long will the E last? \nThe passive on the W is underpowered. Take a look at riven's E, a dash and a shield, on a short cooldown with AD scaling. 60 mana for a 50 damage shield? That mana cost is way too high for a mediocre shield on such a long cooldown.\n\nYou've given him bonus AD, base hp, base Armor and AP scaling. What kind of items would make him effective/viable?\n\nI know it's your idea, but would you consider a form of levelution mechanic, where your ultimate destroys terrain for a duration. Creating a rip in the terrain for both allies and enemies to pass through.","replies":[{"poster":"WAKA OceanGrove","date":"2015-09-16T19:36:57.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers for the advice will go back to the drawing board","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2015-09-15T22:48:16.710+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice!
