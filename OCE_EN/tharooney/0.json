At the time I was fully aware of my penalties. Later that night when I returned home I logged back in to be notified that my account will be penalised with a Low Priority Queue. This is fine. I understand it. \r\n\r\nI talked to some North American friends on Reddit who say their queue times are around 5-10 minutes. Well  yesterday at around 2:15 pm ACST I joined ranked queue.  I still have not found a queue of any sort. I understand this is low priority queue but this is insane. I understand I have done wrong. I deserve a punishment but this is not a punishment. This is just downright stupid. Please in the light of the seven, suspend my account for a time-being so I can at least accept my punishment and move on with my life rather than waiting around for a queue to pop.... \r\n\r\n**Is there an expiry date to Low Priority Queues? **\r\n\r\nAll i want for Christmas is my league account back ","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-27T02:46:01.623+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"doesnt the timer count down? my friends all had 5 minute ones that counted down...if you cancel the queue it resets tho...","replies":[{"poster":"Tharooney","date":"2014-12-27T03:00:10.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No my counter keeps going down to 30:00 and reseting.
