Or what you contribute to the team other than just soaking up gold and kills from your teammates?\nI'm willing to bet you've NEVER THOUGHT, and you've just mindlessly bought items and thrown yourself into the game.\n\nWell tough luck princess, you now have to actually USE YOUR BRAIN in order to succeed as an ADC.","replies":[{"poster":"Snowdr0ppings","date":"2015-08-21T01:30:12.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All adcs do are complain... \"oh no I did not get a gank from my jungler\" \"Support stop feeding\" \"omfg blitz stop pulling them into me\" \"report support still feeding\" they do not understand that the supports are dieing for them so they can stay and get CS...
