Unfortunately when you leave a game, whether it's for a good reason or not it impacts the other players in the game.\n\nBoth your team and the other team are suddenly in a game that's not as good. When you queue up it's you saying 'hey i'm going to commit to playing this game to the end'. This applies whether it's a normal or ranked game.\n\nIt's the same with disconnects. I suffer from them at times at home and it's frustrating as hell, but it's even more frustrating for the other players in the game. \n\nMy internet issues are not their fault, and I could argue that it's not my fault because my internet provider or the phone line or something else is messing up, but realistically when i say 'Hey i'm going to commit to playing this game to the end' that also means how I connect to the internet.\n\nAgain, I totally understand the frustration, because sometimes you just have to go, but for the most part this won't happen that often and you are making it a bad experience for the other players in a game when you leave.","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-02-23T07:47:12.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What happens if like the internet provider fucks up?\n\nThere's no justice there.\n\nAnd usually we can't prove that they did fuck up *cough* tpg *cough*.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-02-23T13:11:05.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Such a scenario doesn't occur often enough to cause you to get hi with the Leaver Buster.\n\nI had two DCs in one game the other week, but because it was one game out of the hundreds I play Leaver Buster ignores me.\n\nYou have to leave a significant portion of your games in order to get hit with low priority.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"shadowseek3r","date":"2016-02-23T08:33:41.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"well then ill say this, can anyone actually join a game and promise that they will not possibly have to leave or be disconnected, if you think you can then you are lying. i understand fully that yes it ruins games, i hate it too, but the low priority queue is unjustified and unfair, 5 game of waiting 20 minutes per game is ridiculous, might aswell not play at all if im gonna d/c once a week then have to wait 20 minutes per game.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-24T04:15:22.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=shadowseek3r,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=fdPHse98,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-02-23T08:33:41.055+0000)\n>\n> well then ill say this, can anyone actually join a game and promise that they will not possibly have to leave or be disconnected, if you think you can then you are lying. i understand fully that yes it ruins games, i hate it too, but the low priority queue is unjustified and unfair, 5 game of waiting 20 minutes per game is ridiculous, might aswell not play at all if im gonna d/c once a week then have to wait 20 minutes per game.\n\nIt cannot be fully guaranteed but it can be known that you leaving/dcing/whatever is virtually impossible. Besides that, LeaverBuster is based off of percentage of games, so unless you rarely play, you're not going to get punished.

Using an extreme example:  you get an afk warning 5 times in a row for sitting in fountain because your team has agreed to give up (you have an intentional feeder ect). You will be punished and reported quicker than the intentional feeder. Secondly, low priority queue is built in for people with high hidden rating unintentionally of course. Finished last year as a challenger on main and went 3 for 1. My 5th game of rank at a normal time friday around 9 o'clock had a que time of 45 minutes. On average i have 20 minute que times at normal hours. 3rd issue which is unrelated is the replay system. Why does one need 3rd party programs to watch their games. Simply put O.P riot is incompetent with one of the biggest games in the world. Probs will hurt them in the future in terms of profits.","replies":[]}]}
