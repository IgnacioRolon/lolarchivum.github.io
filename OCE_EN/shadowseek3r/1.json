I was at the under chat restrictions, at the time of pre-season. i was given chat restrictions months before the end of season 6 Though and i chose to take a well needed break from the game too cool off because i was clearly getting very frustrated with the game and its players so I decided to wait for next season. Little did i know, i was not going to get my rewards for the season. I worked really hard to get to gold, I played day and night for months. Iv played league of legends since season 1 or 2 and have never reached such a high division, i was really looking forward to getting my first load screen border since it was a huge goal for me when i played a few years ago. i feel like i deserve some leniency after the years iv put into this game","replies":[]}
