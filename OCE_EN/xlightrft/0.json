Does anyone else think there should be a minimum ammount of wins (or atleast games played) with champions BEFORE you are allowed play them in a  ranked game? or an overall ammount of wins perhaps. Thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Boosted To B5","date":"2016-05-14T07:07:10.518+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel as though this won't be implemented, because of the amount of smurfs being created . Also your opinion on \"trying to climb out of low elo near impossible\" isn't relevant because most people are around the elo they deserve to be but people in low elo can't accept that they are indeed bad at the game and choose to blame their team (this is a crude generalisation.) As with the amount of wins needed. It simply doesn't fit the game. LoL already has a leveling system and by the end of that the person playing the game _should_ have enough of an understanding of the game that they are able to play ranked. Also the amount of high elo players that take a champion they might never have played into ranked but still play well with them is insane.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-05-17T12:42:51.492+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not even close to the the knowledge you need for ranked, you shouldn't even bother until at LEAST 250 wins.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-05-14T09:16:26.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that kinda sounds like me","replies":[]}]}
