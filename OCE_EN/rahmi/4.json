One thing that immediately caught my eye, was the spelling and punctuation at the start of the video, this is easily fixed but is just a little annoying. I did like how you zoomed in on yourself after getting a kill, that was well done. I'm not to great at making montages but that's just a few things I can think of. I guess just keep making them and you will get better aswell!\n\nGood luck in the future man!","replies":[{"poster":"Rahmi","date":"2016-03-19T04:22:26.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah haha, Thought no one would pick up on it tbh. but hey. mistakes happen haha. thanks heaps for the feedback. \n\nwith every video im trying to improve lol. :)","replies":[]}]}]}
