He served in his local militia, using his agility and experience in martial disciplines to probe out the weaknesses in bandit camps and small invading forces, then call on and often lead the counter-offensive charge. He was test subject 93: DIY\r\n\r\nElorus was a gladiator. He had been in the arenas for a year, and was beginning to rise into the ranks of fame after his fruitful career, owing in no small part to his single-minded muscle building and his frenzied, nearly bezerk fighting style. He was test subject 94: ELO\r\n\r\nBoth were experiencing reliable success in combat against their approximate equals. Both showed a particular talent for their respective fields. Both caught Dr Mundo&rsquo;s Eye.\r\n\r\nIn his continuing research on creating a super-warrior, Dr Mundo had begun experimenting with surgically enhancing the human body. His previous experiments had dealt with enlarging the heart or increasing muscle mass, right up to completely changing the subject&rsquo;s muscular structure. Those experiments, however informative, had resulted in the instability of the subject&rsquo;s body, making them ineffective in combat or, indeed, just about anything they tried to do. Still, the information gathered in these experiments was enough for Mundo to test one of his theories that had previously been impossible to implement. His next experiment would be on the plausibility of his &ldquo;unification theory&rdquo;, using test subjects 93 &amp; 94.\r\n\r\nDiyarum and Elorus became victim of this experiment: Dr Mundo Surgically disassembled their bodies and mounted their muscles, organs, skin and brains on an artificial humanoid skeleton Dr Mundo had assembled using a chemically inert metal alloy. Diyarum and Elorus were kept alive through the operation, but by the end were never to be the same again. While they were still technically separate entities, they had been bound into a functionally single body: test subject 95: DIY-ELO.\r\n\r\nWith the First glance at test subject 95, he/it appears to simply be a slightly oversized human. However, there are obvious differences: While Mundo&rsquo;s design placed all organs and muscles roughly where they would be on a typical human, everything was in doubles: subject 95 has four eyes in a simple one-then-another pattern below the forehead, allowing both brains to receive what they were roughly used to in terms of sight. Also, those muscles that showed through the skin seem split into uneven pairs, turning a six-pack into a twelve-pack, and so on.\r\n\r\nInitially, being Subject 95 was torture for Diyarum and Elorus: with their muscles competing over every action they tried to perform, they could barely move, and with both vying for control over the lips and vocal chords, even their cries for help became pathetic gurgles. None of this was helped by the tests Mundo ran on the new body, testing its combat potential and the other effects of this bizarre experiment, ending, as Mundo&rsquo;s experiments do, with a horrible pain with every one of subject 95&rsquo;s failures.\r\n\r\nSlowly, though, a change began. Being trapped together as they were, enduring terrible hardships and pain as one, Diyarum and Elorus began to form a telepathic link. As the link strengthened, it allowed Diyarum and Elorus to co-ordinate their movement up to the point of perfection, even regaining the ability to communicate. They even gained the ability to use each-other&rsquo;s senses, seeing through each-other&rsquo;s eyes and eventually reading each-other&rsquo;s thoughts. This was the beginning of Diyelo.\r\n\r\nOnce they had complete control of the body, they found it to be more powerful than they had felt it to be before: with Elorus&rsquo;s more powerful muscles now under Diyarum&rsquo;s partial control, He discovered the new body had, despite its bulk, a power-to-weight ratio greater than that of Diyarum&rsquo;s original body without significant sacrifice to flexibility, making more impressive feats of agility possible. And with Diyarum&rsquo;s tighter, denser muscular structure and martial experience contributing, Elorus&rsquo;s punches flew faster and truer without sacrificing the power put behind them. \r\n\r\nFrom here, something bizarre happened. As they continued to use the link, Diyarum and Elorus subconsciously gave the active controls of their muscles to the part of their brains that had formed the link, and themselves began to regress from using the body. As they did this, the parts of their brains they stopped actively using became a part of the new entity that was forming in the link, until it eventually became a mind in itself, a conscience between two brains.\r\n\r\nThis new entity, newly awakened into full conscience, had personality traits akin to both Diyarum and Elorus, but didn&rsquo;t recognise itself as being either one or even both. It was something new, something different, and it took up the only name it had known that was it&rsquo;s and it&rsquo;s alone: test subject 95: DIY-ELO. Diyelo.\r\n\r\nDiyarum and Elorus had now regressed totally from their old bodies, and were now content to simply watch Diyelo&rsquo;s new life through the parts of their minds that they shared with the new entity, occasionally talking with one another and Diyelo itself through the link, and offering their experience and instinct to Diyelo when the situation called for it. Dr Mundo was forced to call the experiment a failure: despite Diyelo&rsquo;s incredible agility and strength, plus it&rsquo;s combination of tactical genius and fury in battle, it had become to strong-willed to ever be controlled as a soldier. Unable to &lsquo;safely dispose&rsquo; of Diyelo without considerable risk to himself, Dr Mundo was forced to simply allow Diyelo to escape, and go on with his other experiments.\r\n\r\nFree but without a society that would not reject it, and with no calling left except combat, Diyelo joined the league of legends, where despite being a failure as a warrior it found success as a champion due to it&rsquo;s superhuman strength, agility, combat mindset and even mild telepathic potential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np.s. i know this champion&#039;s theme of a dual soul bears unfortunate resemblance to the new champion &quot;kindred&quot;, but i still want to get the idea out there so you&#039;ll just have to trust me that this is original.","replies":[]}
