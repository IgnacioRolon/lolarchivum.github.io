She spun around on her stool, slamming the mug down on the counter and pointing to the shelf behind the bartender. &ldquo;Two Sweetsprite Biscuits, please!&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe bartender took down a cookie jar and handed the biscuits over, receiving some coins in return. Tristana spun back around to face the room, munching on her snack. She nudged the yordle on the seat beside her, holding out the other biscuit. &ldquo;Here, Teemo.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nTeemo took the proffered treat and the two of them sat and ate in silence for a while. Tristana washed the biscuit down with a long swig of mead, thumping the empty cup down and leaping up from her seat.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Break&#039;s over!&rdquo; she said enthusiastically to her quiet fellow &ldquo;drill time!&rdquo;\r\n\r\nShe tickled Teemo behind the ear as he slipped off his seat.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Captain Teemo on duty!&rdquo; chirped Tristana in a perfect imitation of the Swift Scout&#039;s high-pitched voice.\r\n\r\nTeemo rolled his eyes good-naturedly at his friend&#039;s quip. Tristana tossed another coin over her shoulder as a tip before heading out into the cobblestone streets of Bandle City. The whole place had a bit of a fairytale village look to it, from the red-tile roofs of the houses to the boxes of flowers that hung outside almost every window. The two yordles headed to one of the city&#039;s barracks where two squads of yordle soldiers were already assembled.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Ten-shun!&rdquo; cried Tristana, and they all snapped to attention.\r\n\r\nOne group, commanded by Tristana, were gunners, armed with yordle-portable cannons; the other squad, led by Teemo, were scouts, armed with blowpipes and carrying maps and explosive mushrooms.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We&#039;ll be clearing out a den of Murkwolves,&rdquo; explained Teemo, his blowpipe held behind his back like a baton &ldquo;they&#039;re dangerous creatures and they&#039;re too close to the city. Here&#039;s the plan: the scouts will move in first and surround the den, blocking off all paths of escape; then the gunners will move up the center and drive them out. Any wolves that try to escape will be taken down by the scouts. Understood?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yes-sir!&rdquo; cried the yordles, all saluting. Teemo and Tristana led their squads out of the city and into the surrounding woodland. The scouts, led by Teemo, hurried on ahead through the trees; while the gunners, led by Tristana, moved into a loose wedge formation and advanced after the scouts.\r\n\r\n*\t*\t*\r\n\r\nTeemo scanned the area surrounding the entrance of the Murkwolves&#039; den. Though the bones of the wolves&#039; prey littered the ground, there was neither sight nor sound of a single Murkwolf. Teemo listened intently for a while, but heard nothing.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&#039;m going to scout inside,&rdquo; he told his squad, leaping over a log and hurrying forward. Teemo crept to the cave mouth, peering in. He glanced around, seeing splashes of blood covering the walls and dead Murkwolves lying on the floor. Teemo went deeper into the cave, finding more dead wolves. He stopped short when he discovered a corpse that was neither a Murkwolf nor one of their usual prey, but a Noxian soldier. Teemo hurried out, returning to his group and reporting his find.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We must warn the others,&rdquo; he insisted &ldquo;there&#039;s a Noxian warband in these woods!&rdquo;\r\n\r\n*\t*\t*\r\n\r\nDraven led his band of Noxian commandos through the woods surrounding Bandle City. His plan was to capture a dozen or so yordles from the supposed safety of their own city and escape with them back to Noxus; where the captives would be executed and he, Draven, would receive glory and renown for his bold raid. He had not informed anyone of his plan, aside from the small group of soldiers accompanying him; it would add to the impressiveness if it were a surprise when he got back.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Careful,&rdquo; he whispered, gesturing with his axes &ldquo;we&#039;re approaching the city. They must not spot us.&rdquo; He halted, looked around, then said, &ldquo;Now, my plan is to dig right under the wall, slip inside at night, abduct the yordles and then slip out unnoticed.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;This plan hasn&#039;t been thought through, has it?&rdquo; asked the captain of the commandos skeptically.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We&#039;ll move on until we get to the wall, then lie in wait until nightfall,&rdquo; went on Draven, ignoring the captain completely &ldquo;we&#039;ll use that drill-thing from Zaun to tunnel under the wall; and then we&#039;ll strike!&rdquo; He smiled wickedly at his own brilliance. &ldquo;Perhaps we could even cause a little chaos before we go.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We&#039;re barely going to make it out as it is, without bringing the whole town guard bearing down on us,&rdquo; muttered the captain darkly.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Onwards,&rdquo; Draven commanded. The band of Noxians moved on through the forest.\r\n\r\nA minute or so later, as Draven stopped to scan the woods to either side, one of his soldiers screamed. Draven glanced over at him, seeing a cloud of purple gas rising from a burst mushroom. The man&#039;s leg armour had been blown apart, the veins of his flesh turning a dark purple and standing out horrifically. He gritted his teeth against the pain as toxic poison flooded his body; then the life left his eyes. Draven was distracted as another scream came from his left. Another man had stepped on a mushroom and now lay dying.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Quiet!&rdquo; hissed Draven, scanning the ground ahead. There were dozens of mushrooms in the undergrowth, but they looked just like the harmless fungi that grew all over the forest. He gently knelt and picked one of the mushrooms, examining it closely. It was poisonous, yes, but not explosive. He picked another, and gently scratched the top with his fingernail. Flakes of paint came off, revealing a different pattern underneath. Those cursed yordles had disguised these explosives as harmless mushrooms! How were he and his soldiers going to chart a safe path through the forest when every piece of fungi could be a trap?\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; Draven ordered &ldquo;we move on; but watch every step.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nHe walked on slowly, placing each step carefully, avoiding anything that looked like a mushroom. In this manner the group of Noxians moved at a painstakingly slow pace through the woods, their eyes always on the ground at their feet.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later another soldier dropped dead, but not from a mushroom underfoot. As Draven glanced at the fallen woman, he saw a dart sticking into her neck.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Ambush!&rdquo; Draven cried, readying his axes. His commandos readied their blades and crossbows, looking around for the enemy. Darts flew at Draven and his fellows from all sides, crippling those they hit; the Noxians returned fire with their crossbows, but the yordles moved so quickly and with such agility that most of the bolts just hit trees or missed altogether.\r\n\r\nDraven spotted a yordle nearby, and threw his axe. The little creature ducked behind a tree and the axe flew past harmlessly; but as the yordle peeked out of cover, the returning axe sliced the poor creature in half. Draven laughed as the bloody weapon flew back to his hand. He glanced over his shoulder, spotting another yordle popping up from behind a bush. Draven spun his axes and hurled them towards the yordle, both weapons slicing the creature&#039;s head off in opposite arcs. Draven caught the returning weapons with contemptuous ease and looked around for more enemies.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Sir, look!&rdquo; cried one of his soldiers, pointing ahead. Draven looked and saw a wedge of yordle gunners advancing towards them. He recognized the yordle in the lead: Tristana, one of Bandle City&#039;s champions whom he had fought many times on the Fields of Justice.\r\n\r\nThe Yordle Gunner aimed her cannon and fired, knocking one of the Noxians clean off his feet with a well-placed cannon ball. The rest of the gunners opened fire on the Noxians, smashing apart whatever cover they hid behind. Draven screamed and charged, leaping right over the yordles and landing in their midst, spinning his blades around him. The yordles scattered before Draven&#039;s vicious onslaught; he smiled wickedly, then saw that Tristana had held her ground and was aiming her gun right at him. With a boom she fired a giant cannonball; the projectile slammed into Draven&#039;s chest and sent him flying off his feet. He soared through the sky, over the wall of Bandle City, and fell right into the marketplace where he landed in a crate of soft fruit and lost consciousness. Meanwhile his remaining soldiers fled, but they were shot down by a volley of darts.\r\n\r\nBack in Bandle City, Teemo and Tristana congratulated each other as Draven was dragged off to prison.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;He&#039;ll certainly fetch a high ransom,&rdquo; laughed Tristana &ldquo;I would love to see his face when he gets back to Noxus.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n**The End**","replies":[{"poster":"Technoscribble","date":"2016-07-11T10:05:02.225+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"[All] XxSkIlLzBoI101xX (Draven): omg report team for feed\n[All] XxSkIlLzBoI101xX (Draven): teemo too op rito nerf pls\n[All] PewPewPew (Teemo): stfu noob draven jg trolling\n[All] XxSkIlLzBoI101xX (Draven): gg ff@20 team so bad fed teemo and trist\n\nGreat story +1","replies":[{"poster":"Aetoras","date":"2016-07-12T22:38:21.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!
