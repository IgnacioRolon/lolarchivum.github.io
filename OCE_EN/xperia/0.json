Just because someone doesn’t use flash, doesn’t mean flash should be swapped. And actives are the same just because some one is bad enough to not use flash or an active doesn’t mean it should be swapped. \n\nYou on the other hand a trying to run a rune that you literally can not use. It’s literally worthless on the champs you play u might as well as not even have a keystone if you ran aftershock on trynd or Yi that’s the difference\n\nHell I don’t even get why u want to run aftershock so much it’s honestly not that good anyway. And if your playing yi or trynd your just better off going press the attack or conqueror","replies":[{"poster":"Xperia","date":"2018-05-31T11:05:03.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you are saying that people should take the best things for there champ? or playstyle in general?\nshould riot force every top laner to take tp because its the best?\ni dont get what you are saying","replies":[{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2018-05-31T11:13:48.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xperia,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=KqOnirrx,comment-id=000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-05-31T11:05:03.991+0000)\n>\n> you are saying that people should take the best things for there champ? or playstyle in general?\n> should riot force every top laner to take tp because its the best?\n> i dont get what you are saying\n\nOk I’m going to make this really simple for you cos I think you have a problem understanding a basic statement. \n\nAftershock, the rune u want to use. \n\nCan only work with a champ that can immobilize other champs. \n\nYi, garen and trynd can’t immobilize other champs. \n\nSo they can’t proc aftershock. \n\nMaking it a completely worthless rune on them to the point that it’s the same as not having a keystone. \n\nIf you want to play with aftershock so much just leave your rune page empty.
