Staying in a single spot/area for an extended period of time (particularly in base) is a behaviour that Leavebuster will detect, among other things.","replies":[{"poster":"Xperia","date":"2018-06-05T15:04:28.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there are alot of things not being useful to the team why punish this and not others?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-06-06T01:21:35.272+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, for one thing, it's not about \"this is being punished and that isn't\", it's more like \"this is easier to identify, and therefor punish, because of it's nature than that is\".\n\nBottom line is that it's a lot easier to identify if someone is just staying in a single area, doing no damage (or healing/shielding) all game than it is to detect someone who might occasionally screw over their team by \"faking a bad dive, but really intentionally doing so\" at various points in the game (just as an example). In the same way, it's easier to detect unacceptable behaviour in chat than it is to detect gameplay offences.\n\nI'm not saying the system is perfect, it isn't (no system is), but there's an important distinction to be made for \"appears to do nothing\" and \"actually does nothing\".","replies":[{"poster":"Xperia","date":"2018-06-06T05:30:45.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont want any trinket in my inventory what is the best way to do this and win?","replies":[{"poster":"Aneirin","date":"2018-06-07T01:46:18.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's no reason to.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
