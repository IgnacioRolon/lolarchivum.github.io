match history you feed and/or pick stupid stuff a lot, so I'm guessing you also get reported for trolling and being toxic a lot, you don't get a chat restriction from one game, ever.\n\nI guess maybe in games where you've picked something stupid (that you probably just view as fun and out of meta or something) you shouldn't pick on teammates, those in glass houses and

awful, and it seems likely that it ruined games for his team, and from how he responded this time I doubt he was being real nice about it then.","replies":[{"poster":"Xperia","date":"2018-05-24T07:45:21.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"the game is ruined in many ways, besides im not getting banned. 10 game caht restriction is pretty harsh for the overall language of the game when you just see mine its easy to pick at and besides what is there to pick at?\ni play what i want and want to have fun?\ni call other people trolls because they are?\nbesides this aint toxic gameplay or how good i do this is only based on what ive typed nothing more","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
