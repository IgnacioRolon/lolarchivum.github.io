I have no idea on how to fix this. If keep spamming launch; nothing. If I wait then also nothing. I really do not understand. It's happening to me right now with the Tahm Kench update. I cannot accept EULA at all. It does pop up and then I accept it then another one appears and I also accept it, and it keeps going like that for hours. Even reinstalling did not fix this issue, so I'm afraid it has to be something with my computer but I cannot figure out what it is.","replies":[]}]}
