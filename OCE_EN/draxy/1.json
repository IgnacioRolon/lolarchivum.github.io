This is being reported by a lot of players here in the forums, and no it is not your ISP&#039;s fault or your computer having issues. \r\n\r\nThe OCE League servers are having serious issues. We can only hope that the local staff will recognise and attempt to address the issue.\r\n\r\nEven though we have had no official posts, one can assume they will eventually let people know what is happening. \r\n\r\nIn the mean time, I&#039;d suggest you don&#039;t play ranked in case you are disconnected, and unable to rejoin the game due to not being able to get back on the server. If you are attempting to download the patch, you will most likely be getting speeds less than 40kb/s.\r\n\r\nPlease bare with Riot as they try to fix their issues.\r\n{{champion:106}}","replies":[]}
