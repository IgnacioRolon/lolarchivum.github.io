You&#039;re toxic, you get banned. Simple yeah?. I don&#039;t think its so straightforward.\r\nEveryone is entitled to play ranked, whether theyre looking for a more challenging game mode, or to attempt to prove their dominance over everyone else, there are quite a few reasons people play ranked, and yet some people are toxic, and some people arent. Why? Because people handle loss and frustration differently. Some people are so well adjusted that they dont care about winning/ losing, they just want to have fun. I understand that and i respect these people for their level headedness. Yet other people cant handle loss/ frustration as easily and get angry and tilted, and lash out. I think that Permabanning people because they dont conform to a societal norm when it comes to an online game is a bit discriminatory. Lets throw out some theoretical situations. \r\n\r\n1. Someone on your team does badly in lane, you tell them to farm under tower constantly, but they wont listen, you tell them youll gank for them if they just let the wave push, but they dont listen. so they end up going 0/10, and their lane is hyper fed, and carries the game. you get frustrated that this person isnt listening and lash out, you get reported by this person. As per Riots standards, the other person has done nothing wrong, its called &quot;tactical disagreement&quot;, you get reported for blowing a fuse.\r\n2.  Same as above, but they listen and allow themselves to be pushed to tower and farm underneath it. Enemy team jungler ganks under tower, secures kill for top laner, your team says &quot;Farm under tower, stop pushing. You&#039;re feeding&quot;. You&#039;re 60-70 cs down at 10 minutes, your tower is mostly dead, and you&#039;re jungler wont gank a heavily pushed lane. Other players keep saying &quot;farm safe&quot;. By now you&#039;re frustrated that you&#039;re losing lane, you&#039;re not getting any help, and you&#039;re so far behind you cant even force a play, and you lash out and say &quot;WHAT THE F&amp;*# DO YOU THINK IM DOING?!?! I AM UNDER TOWER!&quot;.  Its a grey area for the other guy saying you&#039;re feeding (people will look at your score and say you are), you get reported for feeding and offensive language\r\n3. You tell your team to splitpush while you are, as your teamfight is weak, and grouping is going to lose you the game (some team comps have a weak teamfight, but amazing pushing potential).The rest of the team dont push, you get ganked, enemy team then collapse on your team or secure baron/ elder and you lose. You get frustrated at your team and yell about it (using choice words). Teams done nothing wrong, you have by cussing them out. \r\n4. Played with a Draven a few games ago, wouldnt listen to people begging him to stop trying to outpoke jhin, or listening to pings, blamed the crap out of his support. Draven then said &quot;enjoy your lose&quot;(&lt;-- not a typo),&quot;oh no im lagging&quot; and walked straight into the enemy team. When he died went &quot;;) lag&quot;, kept farming and ignoring his team, and repeating the &quot;lag&quot; stunt, then blamed them for the loss.  Post game said &quot;see what happens when you go on at your team?&quot;. You get tilted and then it ruins games for the rest of the evening unless you dont play at all. \r\n\r\nFirst off lets address a few things here, the lashing out and getting frustrated is the ONLY behaviour here thats actually evidently punishable, everything else is grey area at best, or not punishable, yet still really frustrating and more than likely to tilt someone. Riot seem to not care about &#039;trigger&#039; behaviour as much as the result of the other behaviours. The current punishment system is as follows.\r\n\r\nFirst offense: 10 game chat restriction\r\nSecond offense: 25 game chat restriction\r\nThird offense: 2 week ban\r\nFourth offense: Permanent ban\r\n\r\nFor starters lets address the major problems, 2 week ban - permanent ban is a bit of a huge jump. People dont have time to experience what it would be like to &quot;lose&quot; their account, so make an extended period of time before banning, if Riot are sticking to their guns on banning, like 6 months, hell even a year.  And before someone says &quot;the punishment fits the crime&quot; lets ask &quot;does it really?&quot;. \r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re using hacks, third party programs, or smurfing with the intention of &quot;roflstomping noobs&quot;, or feeding intentionally, or doing something detrimental to the actual gameplay of the game, then ban those accounts.\r\n\r\nIf you are just missing your language filter and seem incapable of applying courteous language, or are easily tilted then permanently chat mute these people. If their gameplay isnt in question, then why exclude them from &quot;gameplay&quot;. Also Riot could introduce a &quot;mute self&quot; function that will still show up your chat on the screen for those people who want to express their displeasure at stuff using as fewer words as possible. It will still allow them the satisfaction of venting how they feel, they can see it on the screen, yet noone needs so see it, so no negative results. Riot could also implement a list of preprogrammed phrases, which open up when holding the mouse over the portrait window in the bottom left (similar to the ping menu). Phrases like &quot;good game&quot; or &quot;im ganking, get ready to follow up&quot;, or &quot;im doing an objective, please help me&quot;, or &quot;go in first and bait, ill follow up&quot; if youre a jungler. The preprogrammed phrases would change from role to role. So even though someone was excluded from chat so to speak, theyre not excluded from participating. \r\n\r\nI have played like 20 games over the last several days and  in over 4/5 of those i encountered some form of toxic behaviour, so its clearly still a problem, despite what Riot claims it to be. Riot also need to note in their EULA that their game isnt for everyone, that some people may have a predisposition to certain behaviours that they dont condone, and to not spend money on their account until after theyve been playing for a few months and experienced the &quot;competitive&quot; side of the game. \r\n\r\nTruth is, alot of people are probably going to bash this post, and say &quot;its not that hard to /muteall. And again, yes, that solves toxic speech, but actions speak louder than words, and sometimes what someones &quot;saying&quot; is alot louder than what youre saying.","replies":[{"poster":"Glow","date":"2016-11-11T19:54:57.805+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly, what a well thought-out and well-written post. It's nice to see ideas presented eloquently :)\n\nTo address a few of your points:\nYes, the punishment scales up quickly - from a short period of time ban, to a full on permaban. If the penultimate ban was a 6 month one, I think that either a) players would make new accounts in that period and continue to be toxic or b) players would not play for 6 months, come back to the game and care less about their account, perhaps continuing to be toxic. A two-week ban seems like a good time period, it's a brief sampler of what's to come if a player does not reform. I understand that you think the jump between a two-week and permaban is harsh, however the reality is if a player repeatedly shows that they unable to abide by the [Summoner's Code](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/) then they should be punished. You argue that people don't have time to experience what losing their account for an extended period of time would be like, and I agree. If I were to get banned for two weeks, knowing that my next punishment would be to _lose my account forever_, that would have a pretty huge effect on my behaviour. A player shouldn't have to experience something fully to be able to comprehend the seriousness of the consequence.\n\nI understand that you see verbal abuse/a toxic attitude over chat as being less detrimental than intentional feeders and cheating etc. Although it has a less tangible effect on a game (saying a few toxic things can be easier to gloss over than going 0/20), I think that being chat toxic can be very detrimental to your team also. Not only has a player gone from playing the game to having an all-out type fest, but it is rarely just the one player typing. I'm sure you've had games where it seems your team is doing more typing than playing. Aside from the physical disadvantage of your team having less time to actively play the game because they are typing, it also impacts  your team's attitude and ability to work together. League absolutely is a teamwork game, and having good, effective communication within a team is crucial for success. Looking at how someone who starts to be negative/toxic can negatively affect their team, I think the choice of punishments for players who _repeatedly_ do not reform is justified.\n\nAbout self-restraint: League can entail lots of negative feelings, often all related/all at once, like in your examples. \n\nAlthough it comes out as toxicity/a lack of self-control, it is also a breakdown in communication and teamwork. Let's look at your examples: \nThere are gameplay triggers that set off the negative behaviour (you make a decision and your team doesn't co-operate). Therefore, when you cuss out your team, you further weaken whatever tentative trust and potential for teamwork there was left. When you look at it this way, unless the enemy team is also experiencing pretty serious breakdowns in communication, it's no wonder they can take the victory.\n\nIt may feel good, or productive, to let off steam at your teammates. Because it's a team game, it's pretty easy to blame anything that goes on the rest of the team. When you die in League, you can feel pretty powerless. Your _ability to take action in the game_ has been removed (unless you buy the new Redemption item), and the one thing you came to the game to do can no longer be done. So I think a lot of players, when feeling powerless, will lash out at their team in the hopes of affecting change or making themselves feel productive. If you're on the receiving end, it doesn't really feel very productive to be yelled at by your team. \n\nOne of the hardest things to do in League is to take ownership of your mistakes. Yes, your team will make mistakes and they might throw the game, which is frustrating. But no loss can be fully blamed on the other 4 players in a team and not yourself. I think there's always something to improve on - some aspect of gameplay, or even some aspect of attitude - which keeps me focused in game. \n\nHopefully some of this stuff is helpful to you, apologies for the novel :'D","replies":[{"poster":"Eonexus","date":"2016-11-11T21:55:26.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No need to apologize man! where you see \"novel\" i see \"made effort in replying\" XD\n\nLets try and break down your reply. Yes, you're right, with your first point, players COULD just create a new account and be negative and \"not care about their account\" and come back after 6 months. But that there is the thing isnt it? \"come back after 6 months\". Thats a pretty massive amount of time for one person who probably takes the game too seriously to not play for. But players are just going to do that anyway. I made a new account today to test it, played for about half a day, got to lvl 17. Out of the last 30 games i played, 24 of them had some form of toxicity which I reported for. Now some people will argue \"More toxic players are on at certain times\" or \"more toxicity is in normals\". But it doesnt matter HOW the toxicity is there, it matters that its there. That shows me a majority of my \"noob\" account games have vile people in it, so god forbid that the account was playing ranked, where tempers are high, and everyone feels like theyre not at fault.\n\nI accept responsibility for my own mistakes, and even times the rest of the teams when i gank, or when people dont folllow me up on pinging objectives, but it gets exhausting being polite and nice when other people are flaming and raging, or just intentionally not listening. Lets use some real world situations. You're at work and your colleague asks you if you could please do something, they come back later on after working their ass off doing something else that needs doing and you still havent done it, they ask you \"umm, help?\" and you reply with \"I felt my time was better spent doing something else, tactical disagreement\". Then they have to do the workload that they asked their work colleague to do due to this person \"having something better to do\". Now it can be argued that in their mind that what theyre doing is right, and more productive towards the team. 8/10 times theyre wrong incidentally. Had a Nasus that wouldnt stop splitpushing, i get that Nasus is a good splitpusher, but this guy had no Sheen item so his damage was reduced considerably, expected me to stop the enemy team 4 vs 1as an Irelia. when having a tank in teamfights would have been more viable while i continued to splitpush. \n\nNasus then abused me for not recalling and dying basically.\n\nI am going to make a new account once ive completed this one, and record just trolling on it, every single game. I guarantee that im going play 50+ games with no consequence due to Riots system being fundamentally flawed. Take going to a doctor and complaining about a tight chest. Do you know of ANY doctors who say \"hey, cant see anything obvious, nothing wrong here, keep doing what you're doing\". Do doctors assume that just because there is an absence of tangible symptoms mean that there is no illness? or do they then look at a more in depth analysis, a differently array of tests until they find the cause of the problem?. I think we all know what happens (I HATE doctors by the way :P ).\n\nYou summed it up though \"breakdown in teamwork and communication\". I dont know any other situation you can type until your fingers bleed, to beg and grovel very ungraciously, only to have someone not listen (8/10 times they wont). They keep doing stuff their way, game gets lost. It gets exhaustive and demeaning begging people to follow your lead when theyre doing badly, but whens enough enough? You basically have a relationship with the other 4 members of your team, a working relationship. When one person doesnt pull their weight, the other 4 people then have to pick up the slack, putting more pressure and responsibility on them, when 2 people dont perform, then 3 people have more stress and tension picking up the slack, and so on and so forth. Now unless you're blessed with a smurf who can carry you, then you have 4 - people who are of equal skill level, who are now all stressed out to hell. \n\nIm sure alot of people barely notice a 2 week ban, work/ school for 10 of that, and going out with friends on the weekends. 2 weeks is going to fly past. A new account can be made (as i proved) in a full day of playing (so like a weekend). So the valid point you made about people just making a \"noob\" account is valid, and Riot halving the exp required to level to 30 means they WANT you to do this. However this also means that people are going into ranked with less experience, and probably under the delusion theyre the next faker (they're wrong btw lol).\n> \n> Looking at how someone who starts to be negative/toxic can negatively affect their team, I think the choice of punishments for players who repeatedly do not reform is justified.\n\nJustified? Possibly. Best course of action?. Definitely not.\n\nWhen you play with someone toxic, you're encouraged to mute them. Now ive heard many different answers to not muting, be it \"I shouldnt have to\" or \"what if they say something important and i miss it?\". While both very valid points, the ugly truth is everything you hear AFTER the point at which you think \"i should mute this person\" and dont mute them, is on you. \n\nUnless you're in someone elses shoes, experiencing the exact same things they do, then theres no way to truly understand how someone else feels. Sure, you can potentially empathize with them \"i understand where you're coming from\" is about the best you can hope for. Even if you DID experience the same things as someone else, you might handle it very differently, as every person is different, and everyone has the ability to process situations differently.\n\nRiot encourage people after theyve been banned to make a new account, to put in place all the \"lessons\" theyve learnt. You wouldnt believe how many posts i see on the forums of \"Riot doesnt want you\", \"F^%$% off and play another game you toxic piece of s*&*^\". Their replies are just further fueling the fire, and they have no actual idea of what their talking about. Riot LITERALLY encourage you in support tickets to create new accounts. \n\nYou cant reform some people. Some people just play the game how they \"play\" real life. Theyre straight up, using as fewer words as possible to get their point across. Alot of people say \"You wouldnt talk to people like that in real life, would you?\". Truth is, yes, i would.\nEveryone has their own mannerisms, their own methods of speech, their own way of saying and doing things. \n_\nRiot arent killing toxicity, they're killing individuality._\n\nSo im proposing that instead of permanently banning for toxic speech, just outright chat mute them. The only people who can see this persons chat after theyve been permanently chat banned are people on their friends list, but no further reports for toxic language are taken into account after the permanent chat banning.\nIf as you say Glow, that the person is just a vile person, and will then move onto other ways to troll, and make peoples games miserable, then their only options are intentionally feeding and stuff like that which will result in a permanent account ban.\n\nIn Riots defence theyve brought in live game recording, where you can download games that have been played for taking relevant information from, while this is an amazing step in the right direction, it should have come long before permabanning accounts. \n\nHowever, this is how im proposing the new banning system should look\n\n\n**Permanent banning offences**:\n\nUsing hacks, third party programs that positively influence the gameplay in your favour (except custom skin programs, i mean i dont think riot are ever releasing an Ash from evil dead Jayce skin, and that shits awesome)\n\n* intentionally feeding\n \n* consistently ignoring teammates and \"playing my own game\" (doesnt that DIRECTLY contradict 5 people working together?)\n\n* Any behaviour that is directly counter intuitive to winning the game \n\n* tactical disagreement in some forms should be punishable by ranked game bans, if someone cant see how their actions have negatively impacted a game (fortunately there is replay available now). Then they clearly need more practice in non-ranked queues to understand the basics, or to learn more advanced decision making.\n\n**Permanent chat banning offences**\n\n\n* Excessive toxic language\n\n* Racist slurs and \"kill yourself\" , \"drink bleach\" and the like\n\n* spamming speech in chat window on the intention of \"backing up\" the in game chat\n\n\nAlso note: that while i say \"permanent chat ban\" its not exactly that, as you are still capable of typing into the chat window and sending it, but the only people that can view it are people on your friends list. This still gives you the satisfaction of being a keyboard warrior (alot of people need that outlet), but protects your team (and the enemy team in some instances) from your language, however the people on your friends list can still see it, but they'll know you well enough to just dismiss it as \"you being you\". And probably wont care as long as you carry.\n\nLooking forward to your reply!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-11-13T05:51:01.624+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey mate,\n\nHope you are still on the journey to reform. It is a difficult path to take. Here's what I think about what you said;\n\n> \n> Everyone is entitled to play ranked, whether theyre looking for a more challenging game mode, or to attempt to prove their dominance over everyone else, there are quite a few reasons people play ranked, and yet some people are toxic, and some people arent. Why? \nBecause people handle loss and frustration differently.\n\nThis is a great question that you should think more on =D You're almost there but why do you think some people can handle loss/frustration while still being sportsmanlike to others? There's always going to be a better team in any competition/sport how do so many basketball, football and League of Legends players refrain themselves from being assholes?\n\n\n> Some people are so well adjusted that they dont care about winning/ losing, they just want to have fun.\n\n\nThis is incorrect. When someone is well adjusted it does not mean they don't care about winning or losing. Hell they could care MORE. Take me for example, I play to win, I even take normal's seriously. For me Fun = playing crisp good league of legends. Just because I don't yell at people when they screw up or don't listen to me doesn't mean I don't care about winning. I'm probably one of the most competitive people around, I always try hard cause thats what fun is to me. Rambled a bit here but man this argument always gets me a bit worked up. Just because you care about something doesn't mean you have to be rude about it and just because I am not yelling and swearing does not mean I don't care.\n\n\n> I think that Permabanning people because they dont conform to a societal norm when it comes to an online game is a bit discriminatory.\n\nLook this isn't about conforming or not conforming to what norms are. You can be the most unique snowflake you want. But as soon as you cross the line of causing harm to others or creating a negative experience to others then that is NOT okay. It's not about conforming. It's about not overstepping your boundaries and impacting OTHER human beings.\n\nI'm going to briefly go through your situations, but talking about very specific situations isn't really going to help the wider discussion.\n\n1) We've been through this so much. Unfortunately sometimes 1 player on your team (or the other team) is just outclassed. Most players can't learn on the spot during the game exactly what went wrong and what they need to do to avoid it. Especially because of the snowball nature of the game, what they just learned almost isn't applicable anymore because the difference in power has widened since the last time they fought. This is an exercise in understanding and patience. We've all lost lane before, we've all had a teammate get out classed before. But there is no need to lash out or blow a fuse, it aint productive, it aint helpful, and you're better off spending your time thinking \"Why wasn't I able to snowball another lane just as hard?\"\n\n2) Yup when you're losing lane and getting dived under turret it sucks. It's almost like you are in the shoes of the person who lost lane above except this time you are lashing out at getting no help. The key thing here is to identify when you can and can't be tower dove. sometimes you gotta back off to second turret. The interesting thing here is why are you lashing out at the guy asking you to \"farm safe\" when it sounds like that's what you say to team mates when they lose top. You can understand where they are coming from right? they see a top laner who keeps dying top and not listening to their advice, maybe they are on the verge of lashing out at you? But once again, if you can't handle the repeated \"advice\" mute them. There is no need to lash out here.\n\nThe above 2 situations is all about understanding and patience, we've all been the guy saying farm safe, and the guy getting told to farm safe. It happens to the best of us. I guess I am curious, do you lash out at yourself when you're the person repeatedly dying? Why is it in scenario 2 suddenly it sounds like its someone else's fault you are dying?\n\n3) This one's pretty simple, If you push out when your team aint pressuring then you are over extended. Remember teamwork is a two way street. You gotta wait for the group to start applying pressure and then apply pressure in another lane as well (timing is hard, but it is key). Lets flip the script on this as well man, it wasn't just the team that did something wrong here, you did too. From the teams point of view you over extended before they were ready, got caught and died. Imagine if you weren't the split pusher, would you be lashing out at the player thats split pushing at the wrong time then dies? potentially costing you key objectives? Once again, everyone makes mistakes. We all do, there is no need to lash out at others over them.\n\n4) Behaviour like that is reportable if enough players report him (and he does it often) then players like that will get punished.\n\n>  First off lets address a few things here, the lashing out and getting frustrated is the ONLY behaviour here thats actually evidently punishable, everything else is grey area at best,\n\nI guess the key question here is Do you agree that everything else is a grey area? is there some behaviour among the situations that you feel should also be evidently punishable? (aside from number 4. that is evidently punishable)\n\nThe rest of your big paragraphs really discuss two things\n\nIs permanent ban too severe for being an asshole in chat? why not permanent mute? and why not provide a self mute function\n\n> http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/ckYH3Vtp-just-looking-for-thoughts?comment=0005\n> The reason we permanently suspend players is because they either exhibit the potential to do something really terrible, or because they go an extended period of time creating pain for others and show no interest or ability to reform.\n> \n> The idea behind reform is to help a player understand that what they're doing is damaging to others, and simply taking away chat completely doesn't solve this because they fail to put into practice their understanding of what is right/wrong. Chat restrictions in their current form are pretty good at this because you have to think more often about the most effective use of your chat; do I want to use my limited chat to work towards winning/helping, or to harass?\n> \n> To make my point clear, in the game for which you were permanently suspended you were also threatening to feed the enemy team. Removing chat privileges altogether likely would not have prevented you from continuing to cause pain.\n\nThis has been discussed before, here is the latest reasoning to my knowledge. I mean we've talked about something similar before but let me just reiterate this part again as well. As we develop things for players, we aren't going to be able to make EVERYTHING (maybe as time goes towards infinity we could). We have to prioritise and decide which features would bring the most value to our total player base. Even if our policy has changed since a year ago a self mute function that would be used by a minority of a minority (small percent of players that regularly flame others, small percent of players among them that would have the self awareness and want to self mute). It probably wouldn't get prioritised over features for example (and this does not mean we are working on all of these currently) Client update, ranked updates, Club updates, Practice tool, Replays, Int feeding detection improvements, afk detection improvements, remake improvements, boosting detecting improvements, cheating detection improvements and the list goes on and on and on. \n\nSo yeah A) see the NA post, B) priorities =( and limited resources\n\nThat's my opinions on the matter anyway. The difference between you and me isn't how much we want to win. In fact, I would say I want it more than you. I put up with the same shit you do without ever flaming in chat. Like never. period. Even though sometimes I want to call people idiots for making stupid plays or getting cocky while ahead, I don't. because I know by calling people out that LOWERS my chances of winning and I WANT to win. I do everything in my power to raise my chances of winning, including being a sportsmanlike team mate.\n\nSo I would be much more interested to discuss with you why you think some players rage and some players don't? Have you seen Lyte's videos on player behaviour before? \n\nThe truth is actually, a small minority flame regularly. A vast majority are pretty neutral and sportsmanlike EXCEPT on off days for whatever reason (bad day at work/school, girlfriend/boyfriends mad at you for something, tired, tilted already, etc etc)\n\nThe only way for our community and game to truly become sportsmanlike (and we have some ways to go) is for every one to be more patient and understanding. If you're playing bad understand that others may be frustrated with you and be patient with how you handle the situation. If you have a team mate playing bad understand that shit happens, they already know and how you feel when you're playing bad and be patient with how you handle them.","replies":[{"poster":"Eonexus","date":"2016-11-13T10:59:15.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey mate, always good to see you here. \n\nAlright, so im going to counter-address the things you've addressed (made sense in my head lol, but alot does that makes no sense to anyone else).\n\n> This is a great question that you should think more on =D You're almost there but why do you think some people can handle loss/frustration while still being sportsmanlike to others?

If someone was picking on a sibling, or a partner, or someone important to you, kept ruthlessly and relentlessly picking on this person. Im sure you'd take the proper routes (police, intervention, mutual friends). What if they couldnt do anything? what if their reply was \"we can't do anything about this person until they do something that actually really breaks the law\". Eventually you'd take drastic measures. What if this person only did it a few more times, then got bored and you never saw them again. What if someone else then did the exact same thing, youd already have no faith in the system and \"sort it out\" yourself. Either by messaging this person and telling them to back off, of by flexing your biceps in an intimidating way. What is the most commonly used american point of view for not having more stringent gun control? \"I need to be able to protect my family, and my possessions\". Point is whats happening is a natural human response to \"threat\". Lets now put it into a League of legends context.\n\nSomeone \"threatens\" your lp (in this case your possessions). You first respond with ways to improve the persons decision making \"hey im distracting the enemy team top, you guys take drag\". They dont listen. This then gets progressively worse. With you ultimately begging and grovelling them to listen, to which they dont, i might add. Eventually you have no other outlet so you lash out \"BOOM\" ban hammer. Now \n\n>It's about not overstepping your boundaries and impacting OTHER human beings.\n\nDo you think that pushing someone to the point of demeaning themselves, begging someone to listen to them isnt overstepping boundaries? Someone experiencing an easily avoidable loss if their team actually listened wasnt \"impacting\" other human beings? Riots answer to this is \"Just deal with it, youll never have to see them again, just continue to climb and youll eventually be out of their \"league\".\n\nHow the hell is that fixing a problem? thats avoidance strategy (if I cant see a problem, its not a problem). Its like being a little kid, putting your fingers in your ears, closing your eyes, and going \"BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH\" really loud. \n\nAnyway, moving on\n\n>Is permanent ban too severe for being an asshole in chat? why not permanent mute? and why not provide a self mute function\n\nOf course permanent banning is too severe of a punishment for being an asshole in chat. But you're right about one thing, 90% of the people that flame and rage probably wont have the self awareness to /muteself rather than raging in team chat or all chat. So remove the speech function for all verified verbally toxic people except the people on their friendlist solves LITERALLY 90% of the worlds problems. \n\n>http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/ckYH3Vtp-just-looking-for-thoughts?comment=0005 \nThe reason we permanently suspend players is because they either exhibit the potential to do something really terrible, or because they go an extended period of time creating pain for others and show no interest or ability to reform.\n\n>The idea behind reform is to help a player understand that what they're doing is damaging to others, and simply taking away chat completely doesn't solve this because they fail to put into practice their understanding of what is right/wrong. Chat restrictions in their current form are pretty good at this because you have to think more often about the most effective use of your chat; do I want to use my limited chat to work towards winning/helping, or to harass?\n\n>To make my point clear, in the game for which you were permanently suspended you were also threatening to feed the enemy team. Removing chat privileges altogether likely would not have prevented you from continuing to cause pain.\n\nLets now set our sights on this. After reading the link it seems the consensus was quite a few people felt that perma-chat muting was a good idea. As this person wrote above that this guy \"threatened\" in chat to feed if he didnt get his own way (i assume). And that permanently muting him in chat wouldnt stop him from intentionally feeding. Yes, you're right, it probably wouldnt have. In that case this guy was probably a lost cause. I know in all of my games, indeed everyone ive spoken to about this have just been abusive due to what they felt was bad teammates, and felt they should know. But theyve never threatened people with intentionally feeding if they didnt listen. Riot start off fine, with chat restrictions for chat related crimes, and then they get lazy and ban you. Punishment not fitting the crime. 90% of people who have 'chat related offences, are going to CONTINUE with chat related offences and arent going to move on to other forms of being an asshole when their ability to chat is removed. \n\nLets now address this.\n\n>It probably wouldn't get prioritised over features for example (and this does not mean we are working on all of these currently) Client update, ranked updates, Club updates, Practice tool, Replays, Int feeding detection improvements, afk detection improvements, remake improvements, boosting detecting improvements, cheating detection improvements and the list goes on and on and on.\n\nAll of these things should have been \"fixed\" or running optimally before Riot even **considered** permabanning. All that tells me is that the trigger behaviours that set people off are still in play. I played a game today where our mid and jungle were first timing, fed out their ass and then afked, there was literally no toxicity from the team, we understood that they were first timing, they just couldnt handle underperforming, and i am happy to supply details later if you want to check chat logs. The problem is that Riot need to just own it like they did with the sad excuse that was dynamic queue, and reinstate everyone who was banned for toxic language. Put my proposed system in place. Theres literally no downside to having people who CAN play the game but are missing their chat filter continue to play. If Riot ARE going to be like \"but theyll move onto other forms of toxicity\" without concrete proof that they will, then im calling them out on it. If they DO move onto other forms of toxicity, then fine, theyll get permabanned (eventually) for being a feeder, or an afker, or whatever else. The people who are only being vocally abusive due to this \"being how they are\" have their ability to be vocally abusive removed, but they still have their ability to play the game for the better intact. Im guessing that chances are theyre a veteran gamer with no patience, or lacking understanding, and chances are if they carry in their game they cant be a toxic larry in, then the \"more unskilled\" player will add them for tips, or help. I know ive been more than happy to assist when asked post match when the pressures off.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-11-14T01:03:28.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay so, are you saying people that don't flame are held back by fear? or are they well adjusted?\n\nYou have a lot of [straw mans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man) in this. Playing badly in a match or game is not the same as picking on another person, it is not the same as ruthlessly and relentlessly picking on people.\n\nI guess the crux of these giant wall of texts is two things.\n\n1) You are getting triggered by very regular, normal things that happen in any competitive environment. Especially in a game like League of Legends where you can't see the whole map and you haven't seen everything that another player on your team has seen. There will always be tactical disagreements.

I think it has some merit, but there are IMO more important things to work on. \n\n e.g. what I would love us to work on before a permanent mute punishment that might affect <5% of players is a way to report people in champ select, improvements to int feeding detection, improvements to afk detection, improvements to booster and cheating detection, improvement to our instant feedback system, improvements or rehaul of honor.","replies":[{"poster":"Eonexus","date":"2016-11-15T12:44:36.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, sorry about the late reply, Earthquake messing up stuff lol,\n\nAnyway, Alright, i had to check your hyper link there for the definition of straw mans there, i fail to see how im \"straw manning\" in this argument. Which is that i feel Riot are lazy in their response to toxicity, that permabanning for toxic language is the \"easy way out\". But let me address what i can for you.\n\n>1) You are getting triggered by very regular, normal things that happen in any competitive environment. Especially in a game like League of Legends where you can't see the whole map and you haven't seen everything that another player on your team has seen. There will always be tactical disagreements. People will always have bad games.\n\ncheck the statistics of the nub account i made, ill pm you the name when you want.  Out of my last 20 games im pretty certain ive made 16+ reports for various types of toxicity and afking, i havent been toxic once. All ive been left feeling is exhausted mentally and physically at trying to keep the morale up of a bunch of people i dont know, carrying and playing as hard as i can. Now assuming that these statistics and you saying what i blockquoted there, then if \"they happen frequently in a competitive environment\", and that there will \"always be tactical disagreements\" then Riot basically arent punishing people for being \"toxic\" theyre punishing people for reaching their threshhold for whatever, for various reasons, and for having a very human response.\n\nSo why do Riot seem to focus more on verbal toxicity than other forms of toxicity? As ive said in my other posts, its because \"toxic\" language is more obvious than feeding, than intentionally griefing, and other forms of triggering toxicity. Yes, im sure some people play the game just to ruin the experience for some people, but even more of them are just tilted by the very unforgiving environment that is League of legends. Lets try some psychology.\n\n**Lets try the 4 stages of anger.**\n\n1) Annoyed:  means to disturb or trouble a person, evoking moderate anger. Annoy refers to mild disturbance caused by an act that tries one's patience\n\n2) Frustrated:  something that causes feelings of anger and annoyance,  the fact of being prevented from succeeding or doing something\n\n3) Infuriated: causing or tending to cause anger or outrage; maddening\n\n4) Hostile:  of or relating to an enemy, marked by malevolence, having or showing unfriendly feelings, openly opposed or resisting \n\n\n90% of these \"verbally toxic\" players that Riot think are pricks are following a natural human response to an emotional situation. As ive listed here youll notice the deteriorating sense of camaraderie and togetherness step by step. \n\n>Are you telling me that people who do not listen to you should be punished?\nAre you saying people that have a bad game or get out classed should be punished?\n\n>Do you think you should be punished for lashing out at people not listening to your calls?\nDo you think you should be punished for lashing out at people having a bad game, or being out classed?\n\nregards this that ive blockquoted, ive never said people should be punished for not listening, or that players should be punished for being outplayed, but if Riot are going to bring the ban hammer to people who react in a human way to negatively impacting situations, then they need to punish the behaviours that push the people to their emotional breaking point. Riot used to have a reporting function for \"unskilled player\" but removed it due to the sheer volume of player reports for having a bad game. Riot removing this removed an outlet for players to vent with \"_Well even if this guy feeds out his ass, at least i can report him for being unskilled at the end of the game_\".\n\nRemoving that was like removing one of the few constructive outlets people had, and you wonder why they find other, less constructive outlets for their pent up frustration?\n\n>Other trigger behaviours like feeding/afk etc are monitored and punished. I'm not saying all of our systems are PERFECT but they are there and we do want to improve them.\n\nI will make another account and feed out my ass on a regular basis, say \"oh my god guys im so sorry im so bad at this game\" in in-game chat. Ill balance it out with a few games of doing well. How many games do you think i can ruin before the system picks me up as a \"trouble\" player instead of just a \"first timing champs in ranked and being bad with them\"?. I think we both know the answer to that.  And if if doesnt detect that kind of trouble behaviour, then the system doesnt work.\n\n>In my personal opinion, maybe it is something we could consider creating AFTER we deliver features and cool shit for the vast majority of our player base.\n\nLike what? new skin-lines and chroma packs?\n\n>e.g. what I would love us to work on before a permanent mute punishment that might affect <5% of players is a way to report people in champ select, improvements to int feeding detection, improvements to afk detection, improvements to booster and cheating detection, improvement to our instant feedback system, improvements or rehaul of honor.\n\nALL of which should have been effective BEFORE you permabanned for verbal toxicity, as ive said in previous posts. \n\n\nIll just reiterate a few of the more important non straw-man points in this post.\n\n\nRiot have removed peoples ability to report for certain things post game (unskilled player, and refusal to help the team spring to mind), this means people feel a sense of helplessness in dealing with their anger and frustration post game as theres no way for them to lash out constructively post game by reporting for these.\n\nRiots systems for picking up on less than ideal behaviours are less than ideal, and shoddy at best.  I know this because of several well known trollers who went months and months on end doing \"their thing\" before forum posts alerted Riot to these players was the ONLY reason they were picked up.\n\nand finally:\n\nHaving to try so hard to win games due to discrepancies in the system re: matchmaking, sometimes having to solo carry, while a great feeling at winning, is also very stressful. I find myself having to try harder and harder, thereby enjoying the game less and less as it gets more and more progressively stressful. Riot are big on expressing how bad toxic people are at impacting the community, yet fail to take into account the stimuli that made them toxic in the first place\n\n**This is a more in depth solution to the verbal toxicity problem, and a pretty good solution i thought:\n**\nAccounts banned for verbal toxicity, unban them and make their chat_ invisible_, not muted. INVISIBLE for all players except players in their friend list. Im not a coder, but im pretty confident i could work out a few lines of code to make that possible. Riot loses nothing by doing this, and has a whole bunch of players to gain by it. even at 5% of their current playerbase, thats still +/- 5 000 000 players. \n\nRiot can literally do this in time for next season. \n\nThese players will being alot of experience to the game again, regardless of how frustrated and angry they get. Like i said, carrying someone and having them add you post game for advice, im more than happy to give it once the pressures off. Riot arent \"screwing everyones faith in the system\" by doing this, as by default these players chat messages are invisible to all except people on their friend list. Its Riot simply acknowledging that that theyre starting to take into account the human element in their game, and that people make mistakes, exactly like they did with dynamic queue. \n\nIntroducing into the \"tab\" screen next to the \"mute\" option an \"add friend\" option. When someone whos chat invisible uses this option it has a pop up in the top right next to the minimap declaring \"this player who has been labelled as a toxic player wishes to friend you\" with an accept or decline option that pops up. Once refused the player can never send them another friend request, however they can send a request to the \"toxic\" player at any time. \n\nThis is simply due to me reading posts of people who are like \"I wouldnt want to play with someone i had no comms with\". This allows them control and allows them to decide between comms with someone whos potentially going to rage, or to not risk it and relying on pings.\n\n\nLooking forward to seeing what you think man!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mortis Ex","date":"2016-11-12T05:53:27.320+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand what you are saying about getting stomped, but even getting stomped in lane have you ever fed 1 death per min of game? I have had a few games basically as you described and gone 1-15 or so, in a 40 min game, not a 20min ff. Its just not possible to die that much unless you are trying to feed or you actually lack the intelligence to play a game of this type. Either way, the ranked queue is not where you should be.\nThe system can search for words within the chat logs right? So do it for the lobby too. They say they will int and then die 10 times, well if they were not inting, they shouldnt have said they were going to. Hammer time. They know that you have the choice of dodging, they count that as a petty little victory, or struggling through a 20-60 min game with a troll, how is that not going to tilt people when they cannot leave without being punished? And this person probably says this type of thing in 50% or more of games, even if its 10% of games they are in and they say they will int or troll, hammer time, regardless of if they do or not. Its a team game, and rito want people to play as a team, but they allow trolling in the ranked queue which is where it hurts. \nThey have set up a system that encourages people to bait and troll to get other people to break the rules. The fact its free and so you get prepubes and no lifers who can have several accounts and jump between them to \"cool off\" the acc between trolls and know that if worse comes to worse they can create a new acc and have it at 30 and into ranked within days hurts it too. \nIf you have ever played on XBL or CSS or the like you will have had to deal with trash talkers and mike spammers, you learn to mute them pretty quick.\nIf you play a normal game and see a troll pick go 1-10 in 10 mins you will probably laugh about it and not give a fk, but if the same thing happens in ranked, obv this is where things get heated, there is something on the line.

Riots answer of \"Just ignore them, youll never have to see them again\" turned out to be the furthest thing from the truth. I literally came up with him on my team, and the enemy team so often i eventually friended him so i could see when he was in queue and not queue up until he was in game.\nHe got away with this for months and months.  And yeah, you're right though. If you're doing rather badly, then given the fact that you can easily get lvl 30 in like +/- 50 games. Idk about you, but thats still pretty much new to the game in my honest opinion, and going straight from normals to ranked is a massive leap that most innocent wee lambs arent ready for lol.\n\nThe other problem is the ranked system,\nSoft resetting doesnt take into account your blood, sweat and tears climbing from bronze 5 to silver 5. Lets assume you spend 3 seasons in bronze 5. You do provisionals, and you win 5 lose 5, you still get lumped in bronze 5, simply because the system works out by the opponents youve faced where you should be. You get bronze 5. Its not a very user friendly system to say the least. I respect how Riots trying to find new systems regards ranked to make it seem like less of a vertical climb, but shouldnt all that be done and implemented BEFORE they considered permabans?\n\nBut yeah, theres a huge difference in my opinion between normals and ranked, in normals sometimes i can get salty, but its rarely, in ranked though, like you say, because youre striving to achieve something, that elusive gold+ border, tempers flare. Riot just need to stop taking the easy road with things.\n\nLets take intoxication. People kept getting drunk ungodly hours of the night, so did they all get thrown in jail? no, the government put into effect drinking curfews.

Enemy jungler ganks you under tower snowballing your lane more and more, and your jungler doesnt show. \nyou end up like 0/10 maybe more. I dont see how the system could work out the difference between you feeding, and you just being outclassed.\n\nAlso,  lets assume people on the enemy team can tell you're tilted, and they all work together to just smash you relentlessly until you either 1) afk or 2) end up with that 0/20 score. Then you end up getting kicked outta ranked for a day. There would have to be a way to tell the difference before anything like that was implemented. \n\nTotally get what you mean, comms ARE important, but lets be honest, if your options were permabanning, or severely limited comms usage (making your messages only viewable by people in your friendlist) then id take severely limited comms any day.\n\nIts like that saying \"Prevention is better than a cure\".\n\nRiot in this instance thinks permabanning people for abusive language fixes the problems with their game. Abusive and toxic language isnt the illness, its the result of the illness. A poor matchmaking system, people with a larger skill disparity, people who smurf, teammates that dont listen to good advice, feeders, afks, and people who rage for no reason, and dynamic queue are the cause. Yet the end result is angry frustrated people who feel they have no outlet other than venting to people who probably arent going to listen, people who can report someone until they're blue in the face and nothing will happen to this other person because theyve lived their life trolling smarter. People who have no faith in the reporting system, and try and do their best with the tools Riot gives them. I get that people \"have heaps of warnings to adjust their behaviour\" but if the catalyst thats setting you off is still there, then 90% of the time you wont be able to change how you feel about it. \n\nLets assume its a hot day, youre feeling parched and getting sunburnt, what do you do? you avoid the sun, slap on some sunscreen and sit under a tree, or wear a hat, basically avoiding\" the sun.\n\nPutting that scenario into league terms you play a game with someone who has no idea how to play their role, you nicely try and educate them and they dont listen, they singlehandedly lose the game for you. You get another person in a game a few games later, who acts the exact same way and based on your experience with the person who had the exact same behaviour, you try a different approach, seeing as being nice didnt work. Theres no way to avoid the \"sun\" in this instance, this gets you reported incidentally. Different people have different trigger behaviours, for example, someone just not listening when you can clearly see what needs to be done, or people bitching at you to group when your teamfights weak. \n\nFor a while there i started saying \"Alright, ill group, we'll do it your way, but if it fails and we get aced, do it my way\". So we have a perfect teamfight, everyone goes in as they should, and we just get destroyed. Then i was like \"alright we tried it your way, now that youve seen what happens when we teamfight, lets do it my way\". To which the guy replied \"no\".\n\nI flew off the handle at this guy, we lose, i got reported. I know im far from perfect, there are games where i feed out my ass, not intentionally, and i take myself off my pedestal and ask for any advice, if we can lane swap, anything like that, maybe 2/10 times the team will have advice besides \"just farm safe\", or \"yeah ill lane swap\", and ill take any advice i can get if it gets us that victory screen. So if i can be ok with taking someone elses advice, or letting someone else take the reins, why cant other people?\n\nBut thats back to what i was saying, Riot need to unban accounts banned for verbal toxicity, and give them the severely restricted chat function. Riots answer to me was \"_We cant go unbanning toxic people, people need to know the system works_\" but does it really? Because all im seeing Riot doing is taking the easy way out, punishing the easily punishable rather than making a real effort for their players to fix the underlying problems.
