Now to the fun stuff: Why I feel league of legends fails as a game.","url":"http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/PX5VHney-why-league-of-legends-is-failing-as-a-game","image":"http://promo.oce.leagueoflegends.com/assets/high-school-clubs/img/mobile_heimer.jpg"},"up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So as a continuation of my last mammoth post, im proposing a solution to everything wrong with the game: 42.\n\nLets start by asking some silly questions:\n\n* How do you win a game of League of Legends?\n* How do you gain access to this win condition?\n* what helps you in achieving that?\n* Why do games in high elo last considerably less time than games in low elo?\n\nIf you can answer these questions then well done, you know all you need to know about League of Legends.\n\n\n\nLets first look at the facts:\n\nThe facts are you win the game by destroying the nexus, and to destroy the nexus you have to destroy between 5 and 11 turrets and at least 1 inhibitor. Everything else you do within the game is of secondary importance. \n\nHave you ever won a game without taking a baron? without taking a herald? without taking dragons?\n\nHave you ever won a game without having taken any towers or inhibitors?\n\n_This tells us what is necessary in winning a game.\n_\n\nIve played more games than I care to count, and its taken me FOREVER to gain some semblance of a brain within the game (look alright, its still a developing brain, so none of these &quot;brunz screb git gud&quot; posts please.\n\nHow often in low elo do teams just pick whoever they want (especially auto-fill supports), i get that this is their right as players to play whoever they want, but if you go 5 assassins, and the enemy team pick a real team comp, and because of this you lose late game?\n\n**So my proposals**:_ Provisionals not counting towards win/ loss ratio, Individual lp gains factoring into the equation, and an &quot;mvp&quot; option.\n_\n\nLets explain them one by one.\n\n* **Provisionals not counting towards your win/ loss ratio**\n\nYou can play ANYONE in provisionals. My account was bronze 1 end of last season, i was playing against golds and plats in provisionals. HOW?!?! i KNOW im not gold or plat (or i would be), but this is Riot just setting me up to fail. Its like a school teacher teaching you about chemistry all year, and for your finals giving you a test on biology. You aint passing that. I won 7/10 placements, on a fresh, previously unranked account, beating a few high silver teams, and where did i get placed? bronze 5. Hit Riot up about it who were like &quot;yes, we&#039;re aware of a problem that means people were getting placed in bronze 5 no matter what their previous seasons rank was, or new accounts. Our advice is to just keep playing and eventually you&#039;ll climb out&quot;. \n\nCome on Riot, seriously?\n\nif you can get pitted against any division then provisionals should be just setting the starting point, with no &quot;current x/10 wins&quot; starting point. Your first game played after placements should be your first &quot;ranked&quot; game, as the placements have, as per Riot, placed you where you should be.\n\n\n* ** Individual lp gains factoring into the equation\n**\n\nI know this has been thrown around quite a bit before, and Riot have kept blowing it out of the water due to &quot;this pulls away from our desire to have  game where a team works together for a victory, and is going to encourage people to play selfishly for themselves&quot;\n\nnewsflash Riot: **ITS ALREADY HAPPENING**\n\nThe amount of times someone on my team gets autofill support, top and jg have picked a bruiser and an assassin, and theyve said &quot;i dont play support&quot; and locked lux, or annie, or brand. You check their lolskill and theyve got mastery 5 in blitz, janna, braum, leona and thresh, and you wonder how this is possible seeing as they &quot;dont play support&quot;. I generally ALWAYS play Leona support when i get autofilled, even though id rather play something stupid that doesnt work for the team comp.\nEqually often is the amount of times in ranked I get &quot;im a shaco main&quot;, you check his stats and he has 4 games on shaco played in ranked 1 win 3 losses, or a guy who says &quot;im a teemo support main&quot; whos in about the same boat. \nThis isnt people playing to win, this is people playing to do whatever the hell they want, with no regard to maximise the teams chances of winning, as a matter of fact, SABOTAGING the teams chances of winning in a non reportable way. Same as first timing champs in ranked, pull your head outta your ass Riot, im reportable for being verbally abusive, but the guy LITERALLY holding the team to ransom and ruining it for everyone else gets what exactly?  Now you&#039;re wondering what this little rant had to do with &quot;individual lp gains&quot; amirite?\n\nLet me explain:\n\nSo you&#039;ve got a troll, a feeder, an unskilled player, someone who is first timing a champ in ranked (as in first time AT ALL) or has an appalling winrate on it, so you KNOW your chances of winning are less but you still try, you pour your heart and soul into trying to win that game and then when it gets lost (more often than not) you end up feeling worn out, disheartened with the game, and saddened usually with the whole &quot;Why did you pair me with these guys Riot?!&quot;\n\nDo you feel you&#039;d be LESS upset if you managed to get an individual reward of lp based on how well YOU did personally?\n\nBefore i get into the Maths of the whole thing i need to explain two things.\n\nFirstly : **Area of influence**.\n\nThis is your effective range from when an objective is taken, lets assume your junglers taking dragon, and you know the enemy team know hes there, so you move across to protect him, or to keep them out of the dragon pit. Your &quot;area of influence&quot; means that your able to either affect the success or the taking of an objective, or deterring the enemies from contesting it. \n\nSecondly: **I know i said &quot;personal LP gains, but thats not entirely true&quot;**\n\nAny LP gains you accrue throughout the game should be shared by the people in your &quot;party&quot; or people within the &quot;area of influence&quot;. You also gain the &quot;LP&quot; for the target if you&#039;ve done over 50% of the damage to it.\n\nNow, for the fun stuff: **Maths**\n\nlets assume you currently make 20 lp, and lose 20 lp a game (so neutral regards win/ loss streak). Lets then assume you have a troll, or an afk who afked after the /remake option was available. You work your ass off, take 3 towers, an inhibitor, 2 dragons, and go 10/3/5 and still lose due to the above reasons. \n\nNow for arguments sake the maths will go as follows.  + 1 LP for turrets, +1 LP for inhibitors (the first time they&#039;re destroyed only), .5 LP for secondary objectives (rounded up), like baron, herald and dragons, -1 LP per 5 deaths, +1 LP per 5 kills. \n\nNow lets assume the troll in your team goes 1/11/3 and doesnt help the team out at all.\n\nThe guy who hes been trying his ass off to carry would have got the following: - 20 + (3 x 1) + (1 x 1) + (2 x .5) + ( 15 / 5) = - 12 LP\n\nThe troll/ unskilled person/ feeder would have got:  -20 - (10 / 5) =  - 22 LP\n\nAnyone in the party with the guy trying to carry would have also shared his LP gains, as well as contributing their own gains to his score as well.\n\nIf you&#039;re constantly solo carrying and are &quot;partying&quot; with people, then your only reasons for doing this is 1) they&#039;re not as bad as the randoms you play with or 2) They send you nudes, either way, partying with them is your choice.\n\nThird and final suggestion: **An &quot;MVP&quot; function**\n\nYou can already , report, honor, and gift people, so why not be able to MVP them.  First off a few ground rules:\n\n1.  The MVP button is only available in the post game screen\n2.  you HAVE to vote an MVP for each team before you can exit the post game screen\n3.  You only get 1 MVP vote per 2 players in your group (1 vote for a solo, 1 vote for a duo, still 1 vote for a trio, 4 players are disabled in flex, and for teams of 5 there is no restrictions on MVP)\n4.  you CANNOT vote for yourself\n\nThe MVP award will reward someone with 3 LP. \n\nThis is for the people who arent taking objectives but instead are splitting/ distracting the entire enemy team/ using themselves as bait so the team can win. Or the person carrying so hard its not even funny. Or the guy who is keeping the team together and positive, shotcalling, and taking on the stress and responsibility of a leadership role. Basically, the reasons for MVPing someone are potentially limitless, but only YOU will know what you view as important in your game. In parties regards the &quot;party&quot; MVP vote: the team leader is the person who ultimately gets to put the vote in.\n\nUsing this system I honestly believe toxicity will be lessened as people who are doing the most in their games to win and are still being let down at the 11th hour, will still come out slightly better than the people losing the game for them (whether intentionally or accidentally), and also that smurfs who take every objective in the game and &quot;rofl stomp&quot; nubs, will climb even faster, which means they wont be in low elo as much to destroy the hopes and dreams of bad players like myself.\n\nAny questions, id be happy to try and answer them, and would love to know what you all think","replies":[{"poster":"PuncakesssR","date":"2017-01-24T10:04:47.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It aint that bad, Im not too experienced with this kind of stuff but it seems well thought out besides the MVP part. getting 5lp extra for being an MVP is a bit excessive","replies":[{"poster":"Eonexus","date":"2017-01-24T11:03:04.130+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its just 5 lp, otherwise the whole system falls down, what if theres the guy who splipushes all game? the guy who says to his team \"Hey guys ill bait them bot, then take baron\" a guy whos willing to sacrifice bonus LP for the win?

If you feel 5 LP is a bit much, we can probably drop it back to 3, any lower than that and it becomes moot and inconsequential. It is voted by both teams, but lets be honest, more often than not, theres always that one guy who carries a team, its more of a show of appreciation for this guy, from both teams, as positive reinforcement (Unless you feel the MVP function should reward him with chests or key fragments, stuff thats easily exploitable and takes away Riots profits).","replies":[{"poster":"PuncakesssR","date":"2017-01-26T02:07:40.126+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was just thinkin' 5 is a bit much, like 3 would be solid","replies":[{"poster":"Eonexus","date":"2017-01-26T05:53:30.165+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"totes agree man, im gunna change the 5 lp to 3 in the main post, thanks for the assist","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Eonexus","date":"2017-01-26T06:04:38.599+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just thought id better throw 2 \"extreme at either end\" examples to better illustrate my proposal.\n\nPlayer A goes 0/100/0 but takes every objective in the game and ultimately wins the game.

Using the formula listen in the main post he would gain approximately 20 (MMR system as a base), then +20 for his kills/ assists (+1 per 5 kills/ assists) and gain a total of 18 (11 turrets, 3 inhibs, 6 dragons, baron and herald) so he'd gain 18 and more than likely the +3 LP for being voted MVP.

The biggest issue that we aren't able to overcome is the fact that when you add MMR/LP rewards for individual contribution it eventually leads to frustrating decision making and team misalignment. \n\nAdding other conditions into what does and doesn't give MMR/LP creates situations where players make sub optimal plays to try maximize MMR/LP gains. I will list a few examples below for you;\n\n> + 1 LP for turrets, +1 LP for inhibitors (the first time they're destroyed only), .5 LP for secondary objectives (rounded up), like baron, herald and dragons\n\nIt's great that you are focusing on objectives here. But by adding this factor into play there will be more instances of players misjudging their lead. Not ending early enough, because they think they can get a few extra tower/dragons/barons. Effectively this will reward players for making incorrect plays at times and not contribute to a quality game play experience or accurate skill measure.\n\n> -1 LP per 5 deaths, +1 LP per 5 kills.\n\nGenerally KDA is the most popular stat to refer to when talking about individual MMR/LP gains but the issues are of course it will incentivise selfish and potentially incorrect plays. In this scenario, it would mean APC/ADC's pretty much always get more gains, as assists aren't counted for the players that initiate and support.\n\ne.g. Initiators are potentially discouraged from starting a good fight here, supports are discouraged to sacrifice themselves for the carries. It clouds players judgement. They will be thinking \"Maybe if I go in/peel for carry it will tip the scales in our favour this fight, or maybe not...but guaranteed if I die it will lead to 0.2 less MMR/LP.\"\n\nIt forces players to add another risk/reward decision in their head from \"how best should I win the game\" to \"how best can I earn LP\"\n\nI guess what I am getting at here is everyone has different perspectives on every given game, this leads to different behaviours. But the ultimate goal right now is to win. When you add in these extra variables into the mix it changes players behaviours in game. Imagine a game where you are slightly behind. The more resilient members would look to continue playing their best, making plays and trying to come back (as usual). But the less mentally strong, those that tend to play but give up more easily will then start considering, \"this games lost anyway, might as well avoid champions, ignore team as much as possible (no deaths) and look to sneak a tower here or there (objective gains)\".  And of course the self fulling prophecy comes true as this player stops contributing to the team so that they can pad their own LP gains stats.\n\nIn a perfect world, if we knew and could track every single individual decision and action that leads to winning AND implementing individual MMR/LP gains DIDN'T affect in game behaviour, add unnecessary risk layers for players AND we could balance it so every role/champion were treated fairly, maybe we could implement something similar. But currently there is no such system that is able to treat every role equally AND not affect players behaviour.\n\nAt the end of the day, in my opinion, its too difficult to track every stat  that an individual gets to contribute to a win efficiently.....except for the number of wins itself (e.g. Faker gets 80% win rate and get more wins than me every time, therefore he is rewarded with more MMR/LP). I think what might make more sense is to continue moving toward the team sport direction. Give players a compelling reason to form teams and participate in some tournament/game feature. This way they have more control over teams as its a premade one that has communication, camaraderie and synergy which is able to be grown and built over time.\n\nYou MVP thing sounds interesting. A small MMR/LP gain voted by the players could work, many things to consider though. \n\n* What happens if there is a tie? (2 players get the same votes)\n* Do both teams vote for 1 player on their own team?\n* Can players talk and discuss and chat before voting in the end game lobby?\n* does everyone have to vote?\n* Do you think this will be used the way you suggested (for the person split pushing) or will it just go to the guy that had the best KDA/highest damage out put?","replies":[{"poster":"Eonexus","date":"2017-01-27T05:01:37.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have been thinking about your well thought out reply there my man,\n\nAnd then i had someone suggest something that blew my freaking mind\n\n\"Why not have it so no additional LP is gained or  lost after the 40 minute mark?

Does that make me a bad player?\n\nI am not saying you're a bad player for split pushing. I am specifically talking about the different perspectives players have on games. No one understands the game state perfectly when you are in game. Some players think its over before others (whether it is or isnt). When this happens AND you have individual MMR/LP system. Anyone that thinks the game is over will no longer contribute to the team, and will only look out for their own MMR/LP (where can I get LP without dying). They will either \n\n* Avoid other players and just try to sneak objectives (\"We are gonna lose anyway, so who cares if we MIGHT be able to hold for a bit longer if I am in mid lane, Im going to go bot and ignore my team\")\n* Just avoid any action in general and stay alive (\"We are gonna lose anyway, might as well not die anymore and do a bit of jungle and lane push where its 100% safe\")\n\nI was specifically talking about the above situations, as soon as a team is behind with individual MMR/LP gains players will look to minimize their loses vs taking riskier plays to come back into the game.\n\n> Easy enough to solve, make it so you get a slight amount of bonus LP based on game duration so + 3 for game length 20 mins or less, + 2 for 20 - 30, + 1 for 30 - 40 mins, and no gain after that (Guideline).\n\nOnto the objective MMR/LP gains. Maybe I didn't articulate the core problem before well. What you have solved is the needless prolonging of games to farm MMR/LP. But it doesn't solve for the fundamental problem that if you assign MMR/LP gains to objectives it will reward players for making the incorrect play.\n\nYou're just adding another layer to try and solve for one specific problem (extended game time) but it doesn't solve the root problem nor does it solve the extended game time problem effectively. Here are some examples to help clarify the problems.\n\nExtended Game time problem;\n\n20-30 = +2\n30-40 = +1\n40+ = no gains\n\nThe problem here is while you will no longer have the most OBVIOUS MMR/LP farm games (40+ minutes of just killing barons and dragons). You will still have many games that should end at 21 minutes but don't until 27 minutes or some that should end at 28 minutes but dont until 35 minutes. Because players are optimizing game time gains vs objective gains. (lets take a couple more towers/dragon/baron before ending just got squeeze a bit more MMR/LP vs lets do it forever as long as the other team doesnt surrender).\n\nSide note I think having this means players are more likely to surrender earlier even when they have a chance to win because of the potential reduced MMR/LP gains from coming back (harder tbh) vs gains from stomp. Why play a hard game small chance to get 16LP when you can move onto the next one and go for potential 20-30 LP?\n\nRoot problem;\n\nLeague of Legends is a very complex and situational game. Every game is different in a way and the same blanket rules don't always work. What your KDA/Objective individual measure does is it directs players to play the game a certain way even if it isn't the right way to win in that game. Some times it's a very close game and you need to push the limits of death timers to end the game, while some players in the team might not understand this fully and think lets farm some more objectives. Sometimes taking baron or dragon isn't the right play, or going bot for that outer turret is incorrect. It all depends on the context of the game. But what your system does is effectively say, every game it's good to take as many towers and objectives you can.\n\nE.g. In one game it might be super close 5v5, you're team needs to hold as 5 or else they can dive. A player goes bot lane to push it into turret and get outer but this costs you a team fight, and 1 or 2 towers. In this scenario you are actually rewarding and INCORRECT play. This should never happen.\n\nIn every given game its different and by assigning MMR/LP values to objectives it clouds players judgement on what they should and shouldn't do. Instead of a player thinking \"We need dragon to win the game or to prevent them from getting that specific buff\" you add an extra layer of \"We want that MMR/LP\". Same can be said for any objective, but what it does it cloud judgement, add factors in that don't always contribute to wins and potentially reward incorrect play.\n\nThat is the core problem. A individual stats based system like the one you have mentioned will reward incorrect play, adjust in game behaviours and cause MMR to be less accurate.","replies":[{"poster":"Eonexus","date":"2017-01-29T01:46:04.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think YOURE misunderstanding the root problems.  Let me attempt to clarify.\n\nRiot have been bitching for years about \"toxicity\". \n\nLet me ask you then. Why are some players Toxic?\n\nPlayers are toxic when they feel that a situation is out of their control. I rage and get toxic because im camped under my own tower, because my jungler doesnt respond or power snowball another lane, and just basically afk farms jungle, which means im useless, but for no trade off. I try telling the guy until im blue in the face \"look man, if youre not taking an easy gank top, try and do something somewhere else\". \nWhen im luring the whole enemy team on myself as a splitpush champ, and noone takes baron, or dragon, and basically means i had a meaningless death, where im trying to trade a death for a vital late game objective, for no other reason than to prevent the enemy team getting further ahead. If i still lose this game despite me doing everything in my power to be a \"team player\", then i get toxic. This basically shows that my best in a bad situation wasnt good enough. Yet at the end of the day you're basically saying \"yeah, if you were better you'd win\". Or \"yeah you can all lose the same amount of LP for losing, because you all basically did the same amount to lose here\". This is when people get angry and toxic.\n\n> But what your system does is effectively say, every game it's good to take as many towers and objectives you can.\n\nUh yeah. Look man, its nice if you can win it earlier by shoving one lane, but if you cant, then like you've said to me in the past \"if you want people to listen to you, then group as a 5 man, otherwise understand people probably wont\".\n\nSound like a team game to you? Sound more like people are playing their own way to me. Like \"individuals\"\n\n> In every given game its different and by assigning MMR/LP values to objectives it clouds players judgement on what they should and shouldn't do. Instead of a player thinking \"We need dragon to win the game or to prevent them from getting that specific buff\" you add an extra layer of \"We want that MMR/LP\". \n\nYeah, its basically giving players incentive to be doing WHAT THEY SHOULD ALREADY BE DOING.\n\n\"You have to understand that in solo queue, anytime you die it's almost exclusively your fault. You can always play better and you can't change your teams. I think it's stupid the way people approach solo queue by just saying 'Oh, my team sucks.' You don't play solo queue to get your team better, you play solo queue to get yourself better. And by getting yourself better you're able to carry your team, raise elo, and then your teammates will get better.\" - Doublelift\n\nThis is basically saying \"its up to you to win the game for your team if your teams bad\" , unless you feel a pro player doesnt know what he's talking about?, and the last part basically says \"thats when you move out of trash tier and get better teammates\"\n\nI get what you're trying to say man, i really do, but lets assume that i play a game that i carry my ass off in, you still feel that i should be punished equally because of bad teammates/ afks/ people not swallowing their pride?. If the current system was so good, then why are there so many people pissed off and angry? Take one look at oce/ na forums to see that.\n\nYes its possible that people will forfeit early rather than drag games out, due to not wanting to screw potential gains and losses but post 40 mins it wont matter. Its also possible people wont end games as early as they could to farm out an extra few LP.\n\nThe longer you drag the game on the higher the chances of a turnaround. The thing is, i understand how you feel that mechanically itll fuck with too much stuff, but atm the system is far from fair.\n\n**Do you think its fair that this guy gets - 20 LP if he loses when he's doing the workload of 5 people by himself but cant win simply because of the numbers advantage?**\n\nThe correct answer is No. No its not fair. \n\nBasically your answer is \"he just needs to keep winning and eventually he'll climb\". While accurate, it doesnt take into account the times when people just get a team of plebians and CANT carry. Therefore \"Frank\" (mr solo carry) still gets punished equally.\n\nYou tell me how \"Frank\" goes 12/7/8, takes 7 towers, 2 inhibitors, 3 dragons and a baron by himself deserves to lose full LP when matched with potatoes, Riots answer of \"you win some , you lose some, carry harder\" is the most irresponsible piece of horseshit ive heard.  Lets assume he loses 20 lp a loss and gains 20 for a win.\n\nUsing your current system_ \"Frank, if you couldnt carry your team you deserve to lose, sorry buddy, but thats how it is. You win some lose some. Here take -20 LP coz you're no better than your team\"_ Frank then gets salty because all he wanted was to not have a team of scarecrows.\n\nUsing my proposed system \"_Frank, as a team your team wasnt strong enough, but we want to reward you for making an exemplary individual effort in the face of diversity. Here take -6 LP because you tried your hardest_\".  Frank gets less salty because as a solo carry he really didnt deserve to lose that.\n\nI get that you really think the ideas a bad one because \"People can exploit it and farm it for LP, people will just focus objectives for the wrong reasons, but theyre STILL FOCUSSING OBJECTIVES.\n\nThis is how anything like this should work, same as in a war.\n\nMaximize chances of victory\nMinimize losses\n\neither make another queue and run it for 3 months, or implement this idea into one of the existing queues for 3 months. Ask the players what they think about it when its done (you know, Riots always saying \"We're all about the players\" so go on, give them a say, take a survey, see if the majority want it implemented. If they do, then swallow your pride and do it, if they dont, then theres nothing more i can say about it to try and justify it","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-01-29T05:37:01.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You seem to be ignoring everything I am saying about how it will shift players behaviours in game.

But this system in its current state is not the answer.","replies":[{"poster":"mau5trap","date":"2017-02-13T14:36:06.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its not good for the money man, if they think they have a chance they keep playing and paying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eonexus","date":"2017-01-29T08:17:01.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not at all, i hear what you're saying\n\nI do agree it will change players mindsets, and change behaviours, maybe not necessarily for the better, but players CURRENT behaviours (seeing as theres more than a small handful of players that dislike the game in its current form, and the amount of toxic players). The CURRENT system is also not working.\n\nAnd how could i forget the 4 kda challenge? the reason why its not happening is because i can get 4 kda and lose, due to not butchering my own kda to take objectives.\n\nplayers ALREADY need to adjust their behaviours. Myself included. But Riots current system is a joke, and one that needs to be sorted out, If Riot was TRYING to find an alternative system, then tell people what progress has been made about a system, coz all it looks like to me (and everyone else) is that Riot arent giving a rats ass. If i KNEW a system was happening soon that means that id be able to still do well despite being let down by 4 other people, then i wouldnt be anywhere near as toxic as i am. This proposed system might be full of holes, but its better than the current one","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"mau5trap","date":"2017-02-13T14:34:14.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sigh they are well trained in the art of deny everything but what is written by riot, like mr smiths from the matrix. meh let them ruin their THEIR game, just stop wasting your time and MONEY!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eonexus","date":"2017-01-27T01:50:47.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry boss, \n\nWhen i was talking about it i meant 5 kills or assists, just never translated it to the post, but yeah 1 point per 5 kills or assists, solves that issue thanks for pointing that out\n\n> It's great that you are focusing on objectives here. But by adding this factor into play there will be more instances of players misjudging their lead. Not ending early enough, because they think they can get a few extra tower/dragons/barons. Effectively this will reward players for making incorrect plays at times and not contribute to a quality game play experience or accurate skill measure.\n> \n\nEasy enough to solve, make it so you get a slight amount of bonus LP based on game duration so + 3 for game length 20 mins or less, + 2 for 20 - 30,  + 1 for 30 - 40 mins, and no gain after that (Guideline). This is kinda like a reward for being able to \"roflstomp\" a team and more than likely is because you can work better as a team.\n\nAlso add in a reporting function for \"dragged the game out unnecessarily for LP gain resulting in a game far longer than it had to be or better yet, resulting in a loss\"\n\nim pretty sure that someones objectives taken vs game duration can be easily monitored, and it would be obvious someones squeezing LP if theyre game duration is massive and theyve personally got a really high objective count.\n\n> I guess what I am getting at here is everyone has different perspectives on every given game, this leads to different behaviours. But the ultimate goal right now is to win. When you add in these extra variables into the mix it changes players behaviours in game. Imagine a game where you are slightly behind. The more resilient members would look to continue playing their best, making plays and trying to come back (as usual). But the less mentally strong, those that tend to play but give up more easily will then start considering, \"this games lost anyway, might as well avoid champions, ignore team as much as possible (no deaths) and look to sneak a tower here or there (objective gains)\". And of course the self fulling prophecy comes true as this player stops contributing to the team so that they can pad their own LP gains stats.\n\nSo \"not contributing to the team\" means selfishly \"sneaking objectives\". So you're always telling me IM pessimistic lol, but that could be looked as \"forcing the enemy team to rethink their strategy\" or \"applying map pressure\". The amount of times i splitpush to stop enemy teams pushing as Nasus is ridiculous, or shoving a lane and telling team to take baron when i get collapsed on. Does that make me a bad player?  \n\n> I guess what I am getting at here is everyone has different perspectives on every given game, this leads to different behaviours. But the ultimate goal right now is to win\n> \n\nIs it? because im telling you right now, that if you saw some of my games, youd think the aim of the game was to see how long you could spend running around the map doing absolutely nothing.\n\nEveryone either involved directly in an objective or being partied with the person that took the objective is privy to the objective bonuses.\n\nYes, it COULD be exploited, but by giving a maximum value for objectives, this means at most youll get +18 LP divided amongst all participants in the objective/ people in your \"group\". +18 LP total for taking every objective in the game lets be honest, isnt that excessive. You're right, people will be more focussed on objectives, you know, like they should be.\n\n> But currently there is no such system that is able to treat every role equally AND not affect players behaviour.\n> \n\nYou're right, hence why we SHOULD implement it, and secondly, Riot are ALL about player behaviour \"apparently\", so i fail to see your argument, all this is doing is allowing players more \"control\" over their game, something Riot dont clearly give a shit about. I could show you screenshots (which i will do later) of me being paired with high plats and a diamond player, I believe Riots excuse is \"low player volume\". Would be interested to know EXACTLY how many players OCE has for that to happen.\n\n> At the end of the day, in my opinion, its too difficult to track every stat that an individual gets to contribute to a win efficiently....\n\nTrue, but youre NOT tracking every stat, youre tracking kills/ deaths/ assists, and objectives taken. \n\nEventually the list can be expanded sure, into heat maps, successful/ failed ganks/ wards taken/ destroyed, theres loads of stuff but i think that just initially starting off with these two stats and see how it goes from there.\n> \n> Give players a compelling reason to form teams and participate in some tournament/game feature.\n\nPlayers sharing the LP they gain from objectives if theyre in a \"team\" or group, shared LP for mutual objectives is certainly going to promote \"team\" play dont you think?\n\nAnd \"yes\" while i can see people being able to exploit this for the additional +18 LP, the longer you drag a game out, the more chance there is of losing it, and then instead of gaining 38 LP, you end up still going negative. The system as it is currently doesnt work. One look at forums on NA and OCE should tell you that.  This system, while not foolproof, and while certainly having flaws is far from the worst thing thats ever been introduced. \n\nRegards the MVP vote, its optional, but i think you should be forced tp MVP at least a minimum amount, if its a tie, maybe give both players a reduced LP bonus (maybe 2), think of it as an expansion of Riots honor system. Its up to the individual player what they deem as \"MVP\" worthy, so if someone who has got tonnes of kills is what they think won their game then so be it.\n\n\nIf youre that concerned about people exploiting this proposed function, then make another queue, and label it \"the test queue\" and have it active for 3 months. Now i know OCE has such a pitiful played volume as it is, and can barely maintain 2 queues, but give people the option of playing in the queue. At the end of the 3 months, look at peoples progress compared to where they are now, and then maybe move their rank to the midway mark. This will give people the incentive of playing in this queue, then compare the toxicity level, as well as game length and amount of honors/ etc given.\n\nIf this queue performs more poorly than solo/ duo and flex in any area ill eat every hat i can find, because between you and me, im sure we BOTH know that it wont.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dark Vibe","date":"2017-02-03T00:00:23.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked for a post that had some good ideas and arguments, while I think Marauduar has a point in the change of player behaviour but I don't think the current system is even close to being perfect. No matter the rank you have people Hijacking queues (I had a Xerath jungle today) he didn't care about his loss just instantly started trolling and that was a waste of 20 minutes... \nI think smaller changes need to be made first like a vote kick system in champ select if all 4 members decide they don't want to play with this guy then they can kick him and restart the queue, nobody loses lp or time and it stops people from doing things like this.\n\nThe remake system is also a bit busted - Champ select can take ~10mins + load time (If someone doesn't connect this is always longer) + the 3 minutes until remake. Great I just wasted upwards of 15 minutes and get nothing from it on either side  a +3lp gain would be nice (To address people abusing this.. Its +3lp.. That's a long grind to 100 and you still have to win placements (you gain no mmr from this +3) not to mention the leaver buster will ban you if you tried to). \n\nIndividual lp gains are a nice idea in theory but their are way too many variables in a game to decide who is contributing and who is not. \nThe smaller things needed to be changed first to reduce toxic behaviour..\nEven a change to the report system - if they dish out smaller ranked bans of 30mins - 1hr - 2hrs ~ scaling.. It would deter toxic behaviour, sure maybe in one game you normally aren't toxic but your get a substantial amount of reports and get a small ban (It gives you time to cool down.). The chances of you repeatedly getting reported game after game is unlikely unless you actually are toxic. I know there is an instant report feedback system, I just think it is way too lenient..\n\nJust my 10 cents","replies":[]}]}
