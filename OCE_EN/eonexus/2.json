Lyte (and Riots) plan to ban people for toxicity, while allowing other forms of player toxicity to exist seems vastly counter productive, and just fosters a sense of frustration and anger within the community, so im going to put forward a proposal that i feel hits a whole lot of nails on the head simultaneously\r\n\r\n**Create two queues within the game. **\r\n\r\nYou log into the client, and it comes up with two boxes to click. One is for a moderated queue, one is for a non moderated queue. Within non-moderated queue players cant be reported for toxicity, moderated queue you can.\r\n\r\n**What does non-moderated queue offer**\r\n\r\n* The ability to say whatever you want without fear of being reported, trash talk is encouraged. Sure, some things should be off limits, like death threats and racism, but realistically_ its a game_. _Over the internet_. The person ripping you out probably has to be cautious that their mother doesnt walk in on them in her basement being abusive, and her having to remind him that they&#039;re 40\r\n* A moderately stress free environment. When your inhibitions are down, and you&#039;re less worried about what everyones saying because everyone has skin thicker than fraction of a millimetre thick, then you can truly let your hair down. You are in a competitive game, where 5 people are trying to kill the other 5 people. Everyones on edge,  things get said. As the bullet point above said: _Its a game_. My very good friends know that i can be a right pratt, but i love them anyway, and them me. We understand words are just words, and dont let it define our friendship.\r\n\r\n**What does moderated queue offer**\r\n\r\n* The ability to report for abusive/ toxic language. Once someone has had a certain amount of justified reports they get lumped into non-moderated queue. Instead of being banned from playing the game, you just get thrown into non moderated queue for a certain amount of time, or a certain amount of games\r\n* Increased lp/ip. Maybe getting 5 more lp per win, and losing 5 lp less per loss. An  extra 50% ip for games. This gives positive reinforcement and gives an incentive for people to behave to not get kicked out of moderated queue. I mean lets be honest, 90% of people who have been playing for longer than 2 years own every champ and have every t3 rune anyway, so the increased ip is of no consequence, but getting more lp for a win and less for a loss, is always nice\r\n* A chance for hextech chests and key fragments to drop outside of their usual drop conditions \r\n\r\n**Forced play in moderated queue at higher elo**\r\n\r\n* Every game played at platinum or higher should yield 50% lp if played in non-moderated queue. This means gain 50% lp for a win, lose 50% less for a loss. My initial idea was to have no lp gain/ loss in non-moderated for plats and higher, but thought this might be seen as discriminatory. In reality its to try and encourage people at higher elo to behave more than low elo, as theyre the people whos game-play, ability and attitude is constantly under observation and shapes the lower elos. Everyone is more likely to idolize someone higher division than them, as opposed to one of their peers\r\n\r\n**Regards dealing with trolls/ intentional feeders/afkers/ people who are just bad at the game**\r\n\r\n**Trolls**\r\n_Intentionally tilting your team off the face of the planet by building 6 tears on rengar, and when you hit them up about it, says &quot;i built tears, just for you. QQ more kid&quot;_.\r\n \r\nNothing you can do about people like this. Am leaning towards some form of ranked ban for a certain amount of games, or a ranked queue duration ban. Eventually maybe 3 month account banning. After reinstatement the ban duration doubles. So then 6 months, then a year, then 2 years. Still something similar as current system in terms of current punishment tier system, where it drops a tier after 3 months of good behaviour\r\n\r\n**Intentional feeders**\r\n_Technically falls under the same category as the above. When someone is having a terrible game, or for whatever reason just wanted to ruin the game experience for you, and then just runs mid repeatedly, or feeds other lanes for whatever reason_\r\n\r\nAm also leaning towards some form of punishment as above example. Eventually maybe 3 month account banning. After reinstatement the ban duration doubles. So then 6 months, then a year, then 2 years. Still something similar as current system in terms of current punishment tier system, where it drops a tier after 3 months of good behaviour\r\n\r\n**repeat afkers**\r\n_I understand some people have ongoing internet issues, but realistically, if your internet is that much of a problem then maybe you shouldnt be playing online games_\r\n\r\nI dont feel discriminating someone against the game just because they have bad internet is fair, but imposing a ranked play restriction and/or forcing them to play normals and customs is an ok countermeasure. They&#039;d be aware of issues with their internet after a few games, but when you look at someones match history and they have a huge chunk of afks, then i think the ranked play restriction is more than fair. At least leaverbuster isnt going to permanently ban them. So they should feel thankful\r\n\r\n**People who are just bad at the game**\r\n\r\n_Riot removed the&#039;unskilled player&#039; reporting function as they felt it was unfair, and that you shouldnt be able to report people for being bad_\r\n\r\nThis is becoming more of a problem now as riot have butchered the amount of required exp to get from lvl 1 - 30. Believe this was probably the reason they abolished the refer a friend system. This means people have less game experience and knowledge when they arrive at those gates to hell we call &#039;ranked&#039;. I believe if a player has consistent defeats then there should be a ranked game restriction until they gain some more experience in normals/ different game modes.\r\n\r\n**Bonus idea: Riot should make it so that any champion can be used in &#039;custom&#039; games **\r\n\r\nAll champions being unlocked in customs would allow people to test champs out before actually purchasing them, without waiting and hoping for their prospective purchase to appear on free to play rotation.  The closest idea to this currently is ARAM, but lets be honest, how often do people ever get what they want in aram?. By being able to practice in custom games with any champion it will increase the enjoyment/ fun factor for people, as well as allowing people to &#039;try before you buy&#039;.","replies":[{"poster":"Kreator","date":"2016-05-15T09:14:20.754+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"You've raised a few good points, but lets get down to some proper logic throughout your ideas\n\nFirst of all\nAN UNMODERATED QUE? **WHAT IN GODS NAME ** \nDon't put a bunch of people in a room that are _going_ to rip each other to pieces, you're already creating a hugely toxic environment and that's not what this game is about.

If you're toxic, you're toxic, don't beat around the bush. Using these two modes creates an area in which allows for people to condescend, treat different and downright exclude people.

Trolls\n2. Intentional Feeders\n3. AFKers\n4. people who are bad at the game \n\n1. Trolls\nIn game behaviour is a bannable offense, if you're _consistently_ building 6 tear rengar, you're going to get banned for it, even if you're not being toxic in the chat logs, its quite easy to see in a manual review of the game of what you're actually doing. Pushing people away from ranked ques into the normal game modes makes the game all round worse than it needs to be for everyone. \n\n2. Intentional Feeders\nPretty much the same issue as trolls, not much to say here really because i've outlined the issues in point 1.\n\n3. AFKers\nYou have no right to tell someone to not play a game they enjoy, sorry buddy but thats not how it works. I do agree with a ranked restriction if you've disconnected 3-5 times within 3-5 games then you shouldn't be able to que up for ranked. \n\n4. People who are bad at the game\nThis is again, subjective. you're bringing your own opinion into someone else's gameplay. Simply being bad doesn't exist, you're either not as skilled as others, or you're still learning the game. Neither of those things constitutes a player being bad. If you're condescending someone who you think is bad, you should really consider why they're bad and instead of flaming, offer advice. \n\n**Bonus Idea**\nThis i agree with, but unfortunately Riot doesnt have it on its radar in the immediate future, in a few years yes maybe.\n\nAnd you're getting downvoted into oblivion because when you post a thread with some well thought out opinions and some that are _incredibly short sighted_, you're going to accrue downvotes.\n\nAnd when you spam boards it just makes you look desperate","replies":[{"poster":"Eonexus","date":"2016-05-15T10:30:34.790+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Appreciate the well thought out reply, lets see if i cant apply some 'proper logic' in response\n\n> AN UNMODERATED QUE?

An unmoderated que does the exact opposite of helping people reform through still playing the game.\n\nAlright then, why would people join the non moderated queue by choice? Ive asked around quite a bit, and its come back to me that quite a few people would join that queue, because they dont like being politically correct, or have a 'use as few words as possible to get my point across' attitude. Are you telling me that these people arent entitled to play an online game simply because their personality doesnt change from their real life persona to their digital one?. At this point Riot want everyone to think about what they say and not to say stuff in a nasty way. Sure, some people lash out and get shitty, but i dont take it personally when someone does it to me. The only way around this is to group the people together that dont take stuff personally (hence a non moderated queue). Tash talking and BMing is a legit strategy in pretty much any other game in existence. Lets assume you offer a feeding teammate advice, and they dont take it, then continue to feed. This is non reportable because by riots own admission \"everyone has the right to play the game how they want to. They dont have to listen. Tactical disagreement\". Which is true. But wouldnt an unmoderated queue allow people to play the game how THEY wanted to? to again, allow them to resort to talking smack, and all sorts of stuff that cant 'get out of hand' in the heat of battle. \n\n> Moving on to your moderated Que;\nthe thing that stands out to me here is the difference between justified and unjustified, that's subjective and not a good way to deal with problems.

But your system system promotes toxicity, which is the exact opposite of what you want to accomplish.\nThe LP gain would destroy the integrity of the ranked system and if you want more hextech drops, i think they're in a good place right now.\n\nYeah, some people are toxic, and some people arent toxic. Some people are overly competitive, and dont take defeat well, some people have been playing for years and can offer constructive well thought out advice that falls on deaf ears due to years of experience. The problem is that the catalysts for people being toxic arent just black and white, and cant be generalized. No two people are the same, yet everyones being forced to conform to rules that dont fit everyone. To be honest, regards your example, i wouldnt care what this personsaid to anyone, wouldnt even care if i was the guy in the game before that theyd told to fist myself in the ass with a rusty stick. Words are exactly that. Its like the old adage \"sticks and stones will break my bones but names will never hurt me\". what i DO care about, is results. I could get into a whole lengthy discussion about the things that have triggered me in the past, and the things that will continue to, but thats neither here nor there. I dont think the system promotes it, it just understands that an immediate solution (banning) for a long term solution is impractical and just going to totally screw your playerbase. Might explain why league of legends is the only moba that bans for toxicity (except in instances of racism or clear death threats).\n\n> Trolls\nIn game behaviour is a bannable offense, if you're consistently building 6 tear rengar, you're going to get banned for it, even if you're not being toxic in the chat logs, its quite easy to see in a manual review of the game of what you're actually doing. Pushing people away from ranked ques into the normal game modes makes the game all round worse than it needs to be for everyone.\n\nHow so? Im not saying normal game modes dont matter, but im pretty confident that at least 85% of the competitive people play ranked.\nCould be wrong, but i doubt it. Riot has said that people cant be banned for playing non meta picks, or off builds. Again though, this is just speculation, but would need exact facts and figures from Riot\n\n> Intentional Feeders\nPretty much the same issue as trolls, not much to say here really because i've outlined the issues in point 1.\n\nIntentional feeding and trolling, is completely different. Intentional feeding can be picked up by excess negative kda. Trolling 90% of the time flies under the radar if the troll makes it a lifestyle choice\n\n> AFKers\nYou have no right to tell someone to not play a game they enjoy, sorry buddy but thats not how it works. I do agree with a ranked restriction if you've disconnected 3-5 times within 3-5 games then you shouldn't be able to que up for ranked.\n\nRiot permabans for consistent afking via leaverbuster and a review 'buddy'. Probably could have explained that a bit better for the anal retentive people. Why play an online game thats going to permaban you due to your net connection?. You're better off playing something thats not going to make you work, get champs, runes, probably spend money on it, then ban you. If I meant that they shouldnt play at all, i failed to see why i would have even offered the ranked restriction as an option. Thought that was kind of obvious\n\n> People who are bad at the game\nThis is again, subjective. you're bringing your own opinion into someone else's gameplay. Simply being bad doesn't exist, you're either not as skilled as others, or you're still learning the game. Neither of those things constitutes a player being bad. If you're condescending someone who you think is bad, you should really consider why they're bad and instead of flaming, offer advice.\n\nCorrect. Youre either 'not as skilled as other players', or 'still learning the game'. Then why play ranked without having a firm grasp of mechanics, gameplay and  strategies. Things you get 'over time' from playing , or watching streams or friends play. You can offer people various sugar coated advice, but theyre under no obligation to take it no matter how much you hold their hand. If you were in a workplace situation, and was given advice and chose to keep ignoring it and making the same mistake, how long do you reckon you'd keep that job for? Now that the exp from 1-30 has been reduced there is going to be less people with an adequate amount of experience appearing in ranked, which is going to lead to more frustration, and more angry people. \n\n> Bonus Idea\nThis i agree with, but unfortunately Riot doesnt have it on its radar in the immediate future, in a few years yes maybe.\n\nAnd you're getting downvoted into oblivion because when you post a thread with some well thought out opinions and some that are incredibly short sighted, you're going to accrue downvotes.\n\nIncredibly short sighted you say?. The thing is, that a short term solution is better than no solution, and i just feel banishing something that doesnt agree with you, doesnt really solve anything. Tribunal hasnt been in effect for 3 - 4 years, its been up a year, and already people are getting permabanned. Short sighted is expecting people to change a 3 - 4 year bad habit in a year. Again, would need total transparency from Riot regards Lytes findings before he left, because without exact facts and figures it will be hard to make any kind of informed decision.\n\n> And when you spam boards it just makes you look desperate\n\n2 replies to a poster appreciating him for actually making an effort makes me look desperate?","replies":[{"poster":"Eonexus","date":"2016-05-15T10:35:31.369+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Apologies, id made several changes to the OP, didnt realize that it re-posted it after each change. mb","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lonely Rat","date":"2016-05-15T09:19:42.926+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a well written piece of feedback.  +1","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2016-05-15T10:02:27.372+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reasons you are down voted: \nYou posted it like 4 times\nA toxic queue is just stupid telling people its okay to act like that.\nWhats stopping the non toxic queue from being any different to the current queue?\nNo where in your speech do you have any reference to the title...","replies":[{"poster":"Eonexus","date":"2016-05-15T10:36:18.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didnt like the look of the post, and there were several typos in it after the first time.
