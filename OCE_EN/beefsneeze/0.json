So I locked up how to change that and I found I could go into input.ini to change it, now I could move with right click, but other stuff in the game was still reversed like clicking on the mini map and clicking in the shop/menu is reversed, so i guess the game thinks MB1=MB2 and MB2=MB1? How can i fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-10-22T03:54:37.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you try doing the following to reset your configuration to defaults.\n\n> 1) Login to the client (**DON'T START A GAME**)\n> 2) Delete your **Config** folder (this includes PersistedSettings.json and input.ini)\n> 3) Go into a custom game (you should now have default settings)\n> 4) Exit the custom game (your default settings will now be saved to the server)\n\nLet me know if this helps.","replies":[]}]}
