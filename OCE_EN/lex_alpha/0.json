I had an issue in a game where 2 trolls on my team harassed me and as well purposely fed. Also, the other team had 3 trolls that were verbally offensive. I had reported all of them for their negative comments and trolling and so forth. I did however, got tilted and couldn&#039;t control my attitude that one game and I ended up being saltier than I ever been. I been playing League of Legends since Alpha and I been very good and friendly to the community with little issues. I actually try and promote positive play in every game I play. It is one of the reasons why I have such a high honor level. However, in this one game, this one game.... Those 5 players reported me, even though my friends and I (3 of us) reported them, I was the only one to receive a punishment of 10-in game chat penalty on top of rewards removed and on top of honor level being diminished to level 1. I like to also note that we all kind of know when other players are punished as well when you receive in game notification about such and such has received some sort of punishment. In this case, I felt that I was incredibly unfairly treated by the support specialist (Aka Mama Meep). She without taking any time to watch the game, properly punish all parties at fault here. Blatantly said my opinion is irrelevant and that I should have just muted them and not been triggered. Even though muting is the correct alternative. Let&#039;s be honest, we don&#039;t do that 100% of the time. We have 9 good games and 1 bad game where sometimes we just fall into the unfortunate trap. No one is perfect. I find it ridiculous though how dismissive this agent was however. I explained and apologized for my actions and I even went forth to acknowledge that I don&#039;t mind serving the 10-game sentence, but I explained and felt that was it was wrong for me to be the only one punished and as well for me to have my honor level reduced. I felt that was completely uncalled for and discriminating. So, basically I am always at danger of trolls reporting me if the gang up and report me even if I am not at fault. I don&#039;t think that is how the game should operate. I actually preferred it when players judged players back then with the judgement and banning system. It worked so much better where players knew how to tell trolls from normal players and as well toxic from one time baddies. It happens. We are all victims at times from these kinds of things but it doesn&#039;t justify that we should be punished for other players wrong. I hate that their is no direct way to reach Riot through a phone number or even reach supervisors to handle these kind of issues. I am asking for help from the community to reach out and have this unethical employee punished for her dismissive and unethical attitude. The question most may ask is what did she do wrong.\r\n\r\n1. I asked her to be fair and check out both sides and fairly punish all sides all fault. She said only I was at fault, even though the video replay and audit clearly shows they were toxic and blatantly harassing me during and after the game. I stopped replying and even stopped playing to want to end the game early. The two trolls kept saying no when we wanted to surrender. I find it quite unfair that because more players gang up on you, you should be punished.\r\n\r\n2. She never took the time to review the case, she was dismissive and hostile towards me from the beginning and her only agenda was to get rid of me as soon as possible even when I requested this case to be reviewed by another agent or supervisor preferably. She just kept doing the usual copy and paste replies and putting the case as solved and eventually preventing me from replying because she didn&#039;t care to listen to me anymore and actually said &quot; Case has been solved and no need to further look upon the matter.&quot; That isn&#039;t how customer service works and if that is how Riot handles things than their is some serious issues internally with support because that isn&#039;t right.\r\n\r\nI hope overall, people don&#039;t come here just to be salty or a troll type. I am not looking for the dumb comments of you get you deserved. I think this could a bump post to help other players report unethical support agents who don&#039;t want to help players. I want a way to reach support easier or even supervisors who would be ethical and fair in these cases. Something needs to be done to make these things easier for the community to communicate with them. Otherwise we are just promoting toxic players doing their thing and when you report a person on average. Almost 100% of the time they won&#039;t get punished. Because, in that one game it requires at least 5 people to report them, which is absurd. I think at least 3 is enough to warrant someone being observed and even restricted. I also believe that one game should be a warning and not restrictions. I think to warrant a real punishment, it needs to happen in repeated games and not just one. I think Riot needs to work on their support and work on properly banning people and not banning people who had one bad day or game. It isn&#039;t right and it isn&#039;t the way the game should operate. What, I should be nice 100% of the time with the worry if I play 5v5 and I kind of trash talk the competitive team and they report me and I get punished. That is stupid. It should be multiple game review before making something solid and punishable. I hope someone here can help and get me to the right person or with the right answers to help make some sort of change or at least just have this damn support agent punished. Cause that crap is absurd and I don&#039;t find it right or ethical. I been playing since Alpha and never have I been ban or punished. This is the first time I ever dealt with this in all my years playing this game and I hope this crap changes please. Thank you for the time to read this and I hope some find it helpful in the future, and others find may find it amusing or sad. Whatever it may be, please help. Thanks.\r\n\r\nV/r,\r\n\r\nLex Alpha  (Wood 5 League)","replies":[{"poster":"Puppeter","date":"2017-10-10T20:32:16.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel you bro!
