I got the message that my connection was broken, the typical attempting to reconnect. After I checked my internet connection and I saw that everything was alright, I decided to restart my game. So I pressed exit the game and waited for the 5 seconds to pass by. But as I left the game the client didnt load. So I used my taskmanager to close the game. It worked and started it again and logged in. \r\n...\r\nBut I didnt get the normal reconnect button. It seemed like the game was finished already. But I didnt find the game in my match history. It seemed like it just disappeared.\r\nDoes somebody know what happened there?","replies":[{"poster":"CUTIEBIBABE","date":"2017-05-21T03:24:48.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just had the same thing happen.
