Why is it that when you have experienced players that have played well over 800 - 1500 games in high bronze levels get placed with players that are also new to the game eg. 100 - 200 games? \r\n\r\nThis can be very frustrating to players that are trying to climb out of the elo.. you are almost forced to get some one with a smurf to get you out of it. For example i mainly play supports / tanky champs. Im good at them.Im not a carry and i seem to stay in lower divisions mainly because i dont carry my self out. Yet when i jump on with a duo who is a way higher elo we seem to win more often.\r\n\r\nI guess i would like to go in solo que with out having to duo knowing i have experienced people to back me up. Is there anyone out there that feels the same?","replies":[{"poster":"Weaboo Warrior","date":"2015-03-23T00:52:35.736+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"TBH if you have 800-1500 games in Bronze, you ain't climbing anywhere.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-22T18:00:37.800+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well fact is you have the same MMR within ranked as them, the amount of time played makes no real difference.\n\nAlso if you want to climb in lower elo the carry roles tend to be Mid/Jungle.\n\nTanks/supports can carry games, but it tends to take a lot more, because you can get your carry's fed, that doesn't mean they know what to do with it.\n\nBut it also changes as you go up the elo ladder, for example, most challengers are ADC mains, because they are the carrys up in higher elos.","replies":[{"poster":"Critical Strike","date":"2015-03-23T14:11:11.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your right ...
