Through this time I have lost most of my ranked games, but have won lane in most of them. Obviously I have gotten bad teams now and then, but after 60 or so ranked games, I can't have had a bad team in every one of them. I am clearly doing something wrong and would like to find out what. What I&#039;m wondering is if you guys have any tips for not how to beat your lane opponent, but how to help your team, by getting them fed or through some other means, because I have come to the conclusion that my lane opponents must have been helping their team when I beat them but still lose the game. Any tips on this or champions that excel at this would be great. I main mid lane ap champions such as leblanc, cass, ahri, annie, etc. Also if you have any tips for climbing low elo, like how to counter pick correctly, how to get your team to group, engage, take objectives and also how to end games, as many of the games I have lost we have actually been winning by as much as 15-0 by the 20 minute mark but have somehow went 4 or 5 for 1 or 2 in a teamfight and lost off of the back of that. Any help/tips/suggestions would be much appreciated. \nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-06-20T02:10:47.907+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man!\n\nI'm glad to see that you're taking it upon yourself to learn and improve!\n\nA few simple tips to help you improve;\n\n**Goals**\n1) **KDA ((Kills + assists)/Deaths) = 5+**\nYour last 20 Games you have averaged a 1.98 KDA, this means for every death you had you were only getting about 0.5 kill and 0.5 assist. If you focus on dying less you will notice the following things - More time alive, more farm, more impact on the game.\n\n2) **Creep Score = 80 at 10 mins, 180 at 20 mins, 250+ at 30 minutes** \nIn your last 10 games 9 have gone over 30 minutes and 1 was 20 minutes long. However you only managed to break 200 cs once (in a 48 minute game). In a majority of your 30 minute games you didnt reach 150 cs.\n\nWhy is creep score important? more CS means more gold earlier, more gold earlier means you will be stronger than the rest earlier! Getting core items as early as possible will let you dominate the map.\n\n3) **Attitude**\nLooks like you're pretty good in terms of attitude already, but I reckon its so important it needs to be here anyway. Remember to always stay positive and never blame team mates (it just makes them tilt moreeeeee). **Don't tilt** if you lose 3 games in a row best to take a long break 2+ hours from ranked. (usually if I lose 3 in a row i just stop for the day). \n\nAlso you will find a lot more enjoyment from ranked if you aren't too laser focused on your division/tier. Just make sure you always take away a learning from each game. A few questions I ask myself after each game, why did I die unnecessarily? why did I get picked? why did I have low farm? why did I make a bad rotation? why did I ward enough? As long as you focus on improving your gameplay every game, win or loss, you will have a much better time. As you improve your rating/tier will rise to reflect that!\n\nTeam work makes the dream work.\n\nGL on the Ranked Ladder =)","replies":[{"poster":"campbelltron","date":"2015-06-20T03:12:51.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks man, I can usually get a decent kda, (some of my normal games are misleading), but I agree that I definitely need to focus on CS, would you advise freezing or pushing out lane if I am using a roam based champion, just in general? Another thing is when should I go into a fight versus staying in lane, or is that just based on my judgement that I will learn in time? And also if we are behind or I am in lane early game with a champ that scales better than my opponent, eg. Annie, is it ok to go 1 for 1 if you have even SS trade or to your advantage?\nThanks for the advice!","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-06-20T03:31:35.582+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its never ok to go for a 1 for 1.\nI would only freeze a lane if Ive lost my turret before my opponent this makes it so it wont push and harder for the enemy to gank me.\nI would recommend pushing at the start of the game to reach early lvl 2.\nLike attack some minions and last hit as well, this means you will kill minions quicker and push quicker.\nBut you should reach lvl 2-3 before your enemy laner. This means you have more skills- more dmg and you can easily win trades and such.\n\nI only raom as X-Y_Z champions. Like Katarina-Ekko-Zed etc. Champs that are really fast paced and can burst enemy's easy.\nIf you cant roam, try quickly pushing your wave into the tower then go into your jungle-Or if you have balls teh enemy jungle and take 1 camp.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-06-20T02:28:11.197+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ this guys pretty much summed it up.\nBasically, dont die (Even its fir 1 for 1 DONT)\nthe less deaths the enemy has - The less gold they have.\nLearn to CS (Heck even I need to get better) Try and average about 100 CS every 10 mins.\n\nLearn when to do things.\nWhen to roam.

If you are getting pushed back and someone on the enemy team is ahead, it is likely you will get ganked and your tower taken\n\nDon't get caught up in the 'doing better then your opponent' mentality especially if someone on your team is doing badly, in the long run that will have a large devastation on your team if they fall short mid/late game. So make sure you think of your impact on a **global** scale.\n\nAlso keep in mind where and when you last saw an enemy player, teamplay is the most important aspect of this game and you must treat the enemy team as if they know this. 1v1's are not common and is easy bait for picking off someone on any team, so back to the **global** scale of thinking what is your role in a **teamfight**? \n\nTo give you an idea to the best of **my** ability, teamfight roles are:\n\n- Tank, Takes all the damage for your team and locks down one specific champ (or crowd controlling a few) (the general idea is you get in the way between the two teams and cause as much chaos as you are capable of, mostly you secure kills against who overextend to kill you). 80% of the time you initiate a teamfight (sion ult, senjuanni ult ect).\n\n\n- Assasin, I know this is a basic role and what exactly am I telling that is new... really? Well instead of doing that ill rehash something you should know, an assassin picks **ONE** target and eliminates it. Then gets the F*CK out, you don't do those 1v5 bjergsen plays as zed  because to be honest you are not bjerg or anywhere close. So stick to your role and kill one important member of their team i.e the carry.\n\n\n- Support, This has to be the most underrated role in any situation that I have encountered, not only do they keep your keep your team alive (especially your carry, and your tank which is soooo f-cking annoying for the enemy) but they also lock down your enemies and limit their options of escape **AND** damage. They are the one's who keep your team in control of a situation.\n\n\n- The fabled Carry, Now where this role is positioned varies considerably but traditionally placed bot lane. Last year everyone instalocked adc hoping to have a godlike kda because it is mechanically the most stressful but also the most **REWARDING** of positions, where realistically you are the only one who has the chance to kill the entire enemy team in a teamfight. However the only viable option of play as a carry is damage and if you don't have it then you just became a burden on your entire team, this is accentuated by the fact that anyone who is playing sensibly will know to target you first in any situation (unless you are behind)\n\n\n- Jungler, Now I'm just getting this out of the way to tell you that a jungler is really one of these roles listed placed in the jungle.\n\nGetting a teamfight started can be hard, especially if anyone who initiates think they will lose as a result. Therefore in a stalemate like this combine everything I have told you about awareness and the use of roles to identify a weakpoint in their composition and exploit it.\n\nGood luck on improving :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-06-20T00:28:35.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its because your really \"Green\".\nIf you just started playing, no wonder you've lost most of your games.\nYou don't know anything, you don't have mechanics. \n\nPlay alot more normals before you ranked.
