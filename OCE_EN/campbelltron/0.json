I am currently at 3000 ip and saving up for Ahri, and main sivir atm, but would like some advice on how to get started/get better/ which champs to buy.\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-02-21T08:22:51.785+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you are playing PvP already? New people usually stick to bots and ARAMs. I personally didn't start playign PvP until about level 20, when I could start buying Tier 3 runes.\n\nMy recommendation would be to hold off on buying champions until you have played them a couple times when they are free play. Just because a champion is a strong pick doesn't mean you will like to play them. For example, I know Irelia is a really strong top laner at the moment, but I don't enjoy playing her at all.\n\nI made the mistake of \"collecting\" champions and wasted so much IP on champions I hate playing LOL believe me when I say you have plenty of time to buy champions since it takes a long time to reach level 30 and be able to start playing ranked.\n\nDon't be afraid to pick a random champion you've never played before from the free-to-play roster and just learn how they work in a bot game. Read their skills, learn how they do damage, then when you play against that champion you know what to avoid.\n\nIn order to get better, I'd recommend watching streamers/youtubers who teach the game and a introductory level.\n\nSome champions I would recommend for beginners.\n\n450 IP: Annie, Ashe, Sivir, Warwick\n1350 IP: All of them except Twisted Fate are pretty \"noob\" friendly.","replies":[{"poster":"campbelltron","date":"2015-02-21T09:57:10.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played bots for a while until i could reliably go like 20 kills/0-5 deaths\nThanks for the advice, I'll play bots with the free to play champs and see what I like.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DongkeyKongkey","date":"2015-02-21T08:36:53.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Focus on cs'ing and looking at the map and warding to begin with, when you have time, for example if you're playing an adc and you send your aa orb at a minion to cs, that gives you a chance to look a the map and note where your team is and where the enemy team is, this is by far the most important skill you will learn in league. Your mechanics will get better with time and practice but you really need to lay the foundation for awareness early.\n\nAlso try your hand at jungling and learn the different routes so when you are in lane you can better predict what the jungler is going to do and ward accordingly. Warwick is an incredibly good champion to have in jungle with NO RUNES AT ALL, he's very safe and doesn't get low on health which can be a problem in the new jungle. You could also balance his poor early game ganking with a jungler like lee sin or khazix (although khazix is kind of mechanics heavy so maybe not him for now).\n\nDon't expect to be really good to begin with though, If you've just started it's going to be hard and it will probably take you a while to 'git gud', as other people have been playing for a long time.","replies":[{"poster":"campbelltron","date":"2015-02-21T10:00:49.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have no idea about jungling, so I might watch some jungling vids and learn about the buffs for killing different creatures and whatnot.

Problem areas where you can see the two different team colors getting very close in other lanes is a good indicator, but you need to use your better judgement. This is especially important in top if you run tele.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-02-21T11:12:14.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, the mini-map is your friend with Jungling. If you see an enemy shoving lane into your tower, that is the perfect opportunity for ganking. The easiest junglers to learn are probably {{champion:19}} Warwick, who has no trouble taking damage from minions as he heals a lot of the damage done thanks to passive and Q, and {{champion:9}} Fiddlesticks, who is more delicate when it comes to team fights, but has infinite health in the jungle because of his W - drain. However, Fiddle is very blue buff reliant, so you need to be careful of that. \n\nJust watch videos and also watch pro games to pick up tips. Believe it or not, watching the pros can actually give you incredible knowledge about the game, so if you are keen on watching them, look them up on YouTube","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-02-21T11:01:10.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically, find champ that's on free week that you LOVE and I mean **LOVE** to play. Use them as your main and buy them. After that, you want to save up IP until you have around 15,000 so that when you do get tier 3 runes at level 20, you can fill out all your pages. After you have more than 15,000IP, then just spend it on whatever you want, as long as you don't go under 15,000. After you fill out your rune pages, you should earn enough IP between levels to get all your runes.\n\nAs for gameplay, don't forget to ward. No matter what lane you play Ward key bushes and gank points, and most importantly at least pink dragon or Baron Nashor if no one on your team does it. Map vision wins games, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\nAlso, masteries. Don't forget to put a point into them whenever you level up. they are free to use and you can have up to 20 pages of them.\n\nLearning the fundamentals of each lane will also help your team out tremendously. You can't always have your favourite lane, so if you get put into a different roll, then at least you know how to play that role. \n\nLearning to last hit, while it doesn't seem to matter much, can earn you that awesome stuff we call GOLD. You won't be able to last hit every single minion in the game, but always try to do so. It isn't always about the kills. In fact, If you look it up somewhere then you'll find that 1 kill equals around 15-20 CS worth of gold depending on what you kill.\n\nIf you want more advice, if you add me I'll help out in anyway I can. Saying that though, I still have a lot to learn and I am no way pro at this game. However, it's always nice to play with a friend.","replies":[]}]}
