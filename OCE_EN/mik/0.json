It was made well before all the other project skins and his recall animation and effects in my opinion have nowhere near as much detail as the others do, and I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not alone on this one. Also, will his skin be on sale again soon?\r\n\r\nThanks, :D {{champion:157}}","replies":[{"poster":"Gravelord","date":"2015-10-03T20:41:42.385+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yorick and Poppy?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-10-03T06:46:47.065+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering actual champs like udyr are so outdated design wise and haven't been updated for years, its unlikely they'll update something that came out last year and that is only a skin, not even an actual champ.\n\nalso if they did do it, it would be the first time in lol history (to my knowledge) that a skin was updated like this without a champ update as well.\n\nso its unlikely, but yasuo is one of the better project skins anyway.","replies":[]}]}
