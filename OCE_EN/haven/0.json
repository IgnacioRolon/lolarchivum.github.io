If the punishment was for behaviour unrelated to chat (like intent feeding) then you'll jump straight to a 14 day. It doesn't make sense to chat ban for a non chat offence.\n\nIf you were banned for chat then likely it was something severe like hate speech as such things will see you escalated through punishment tiers.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-10-15T22:02:41.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"My ban was hate speech?\n\nFuck this is news to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-10-16T00:34:07.839+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I did say likely. You're saying you never received a chat restriction before? Because for you I would find it strange to jump straight to 14 day, but I can also see you getting a chat restriction some long time ago and not remaining neutral enough to drop the punishment tier over time.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-10-16T00:52:59.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"No i had NEVER received a punishment, that's my point.\n\nBut keep proving you don't even know how the system you defend works.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-10-16T00:59:55.676+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I was asking a question with the intent of helping you work out why you received the punishment you did, because if it was in error then you know maybe we could do something about that.
