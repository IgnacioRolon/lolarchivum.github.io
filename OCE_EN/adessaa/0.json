My question is i just got a warning for abusive langue, which I assume is riots way of saying dont swear or use profanity. which i can assure you I do not do... even when i say something negative i use what i like to say as the sandwich technique something positive, something negative, (the issue i have with another player) then something positive, (i have had assertive training). And i have also been active on the tribunal in the past trying to clear some toxic players ( not this season) and i am just wondering if i should worry about any repercussions? (i have only received warnings for being afk, which were connections problems)\r\n\r\nthanks guys","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2015-11-17T00:55:41.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mate, its coming from an automated system (Like leaver Buster etc). If you get a few players per game reporting you for the same thing, then you will receive these. Some penalties may happen, which you can send a support ticket to riot to explain your situation, only then they will review your situation and decide an outcome.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714\n\nHave a look at this.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-17T11:29:40.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As I understand it, you get those notifications even from just one game if it's from more than one player, doesn't mean the reports are legitimate or will be counted as such, just that they were filed, if he genuinely didn't do anything wrong, which it sounded like he didn't, and these guys are just salty or something the reports will just get thrown out and there's nothing to worry about.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CandyVanisClosed","date":"2015-11-17T04:37:53.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive been saying that the system could be abused by players just like this and what you get a penalty because of it...i hope they just fix the system of players not being banned when they should because it would clear up this very quickly if it was...","replies":[]},{"poster":"lordofrage","date":"2015-11-17T00:55:48.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"plebs for lyfe","replies":[]}]}
