The bonus section of that ability for armor which i believe is yellow is never increasing no matter how much I buy it forever stays at (0) the purple next to it which i believe to be  MR adjusts fine . Not really fair as we cant use the champ to its full potential. Please fix this.","replies":[{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2017-03-22T07:42:22.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They've yet again not updated something that has came out of PBE. Just like bond of stone it was changed to stoneborn pact but left a 1 patch worth of time where it was bond of stone instead of the new name. also a few tool tips were broken. He did have Armor scaling on W and R being 4% per 100 amour but was taken away due to him showing being too strong as he is a counter pick to AP damage not AD so building armor and have armor scalings on a AP counter tank is really unbalanced. it will be back to normal next patch","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-03-22T07:44:04.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks for the report! I just investigated this ability. I believe the yellow number shouldn't be coming up as it only scales off magic resist.\n\nDAMAGE REDUCTION: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40% (+ 8% per 100 bonus magic resistance)\n\nWill message the team to let them know. As FS Bruce mentioned its not meant to have armour scaling, most likely just incorrect tool tip.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-03-22T10:16:35.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No it shouldn't, the armour scale was removed during the second patch of his pbe cycle as it was providing him too much strength.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
