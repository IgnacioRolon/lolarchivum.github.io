Thanks","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"On behalf of all the passionate League of Legends players out there from Unranked to Diamond, Thank You for creating an amazing game and doing it justice every since year. Your efforts and work have not gone unnoticed from me and probably many others. From the support team helping me with game play issues to the champ design team making amazing champs and putting hard work and effort into making a champ that is really special and almost a piece of art. When things go wrong, you guys are always there to fix it as soon as possible and when we are in trouble you never leave us to solve the issue ourselves. To pretty much everyone at Riot, Thank You.\n\nI never get to say thanks when you guys help me but really, you are the back bone of League. So Thank You for everything.","replies":[{"poster":"Gummyjacob","date":"2015-01-06T12:48:58.780+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think we should also thank Riot for dealing with a small portion of the community who seem to enjoy raging on the boards or trolling ingame.
