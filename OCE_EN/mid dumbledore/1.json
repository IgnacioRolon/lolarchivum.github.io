I never want to play with him for 2 specific reasons.\r\n1. The matchmaking system automatically places you with higher ranked opponents when you duo so it makes it harder for me hence why so many duos stuff up.\r\n2. He doesn&#039;t take ranked seriously enough but I do. He even said it to my face &quot; I&#039;m getting bored of League, I&#039;m not really having fun and I don&#039;t really care about my rank&quot;. He only cares about his way of fun which is stuffing around and making st00pid mistakes to stuff up the team. Told him that&#039;s for normals.\r\n\r\nMy issue is, when I tell him that I don&#039;t want to play with him, he takes it very personal and now I have to schedule my hours of play time around his so I don&#039;t have to play with him. He could literally go 10/0 but after a while, he could go 10/16. I told him he doesn&#039;t take it seriously enough to play with me so he got mad (really mad, thinks he&#039;s MLG cause he got Ziggs Pentakill off my Varus ult). He&#039;s a friend so I can&#039;t tell him &quot;you&#039;re f**king sh*t&quot;. I do have to be honest there is a reason why he is in Bronze and I&#039;m trying to get out of Silver. ;-;  What do I do?","replies":[{"poster":"vicelore","date":"2015-07-01T06:03:46.815+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Grow some balls and tell him the truth.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2015-07-01T01:00:38.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Make a smurf and play on that if you really have to.","replies":[{"poster":"Always Runnin","date":"2015-07-01T03:41:24.835+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No need to make a smurf, easier just to change your name....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-01T02:02:05.252+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">My issue is, when I tell him that I don't want to play with him, he takes it very personal\n\nTell him to quit being a bitch, it's personal, but that doesn't make it wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Mid Dumbledore","date":"2015-07-01T10:48:24.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"very true","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-07-01T01:29:36.967+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play with him on normals instead?\nThat way it doesn't stuff up your ranked.
