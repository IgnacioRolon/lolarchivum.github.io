How long can I flick through my friends profiles and see the same banner over... and over.... and over. I know it isn't an important feature to pretty much anybody but still it's always something we have to see. Can't there be like an option to put your last played champion on it, or your favorite champion, or just a classic splash you like. I really don't like how you can only change the Banner if you have an Ultimate skin. It would be cool if you could change it to suit you and showcase something apart from an old man.","replies":[{"poster":"proMINscuous","date":"2015-07-09T22:05:17.447+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's the rectangle picture on your front profile page. If you haven't changed it, it should be a elder man thats in a hoodie and has a white beard, some people have pulsefire ezreal as their profile picture and some have spirit guard udyr and I don't know if theres more. So basically the Banner he is talking about is the rectangle picture with the elder man with the hoodie with a white beard.","replies":[{"poster":"Mid Dumbledore","date":"2015-07-09T23:01:27.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely what i'm talking about","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-09T13:36:45.918+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel a bit stupid for asking this, but what exactly do you mean by banner?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-07-10T01:46:34.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Apparently in 5.14 they have two new banners: http://www.surrenderat20.net/2015/07/79-pbe-update.html#more","replies":[{"poster":"Mid Dumbledore","date":"2015-07-10T03:08:54.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol the ones on your profile not in game hahah","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-07-10T03:39:00.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh, thought they were profile banners lol.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
