She has the only heal that requires using health also mana. also needs a in game skin update as they all look ugly.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m sure there are others out there who agree with me that Riot made a great support into a not so great support.","replies":[{"poster":"Suppbunny","date":"2015-06-25T06:12:11.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok yes she is strong only down side is her hp costing heal and that riot is slowly removing silences from the game, soooo when that happens what happens to soraka e it wont be nearly as good","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crowd Pleasa","date":"2015-06-24T07:38:10.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Incorrect, she is actually stronger now when played correctly. Aoe slow which also heals her. An aoe instant cast silence and root. And the ability to heal  an ally  for up to 2500 health in under 7 seconds, while also giving them increased attack speed and magic damage on hit if you have ardent censor.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-24T07:21:54.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soraka is fine as she is now, and honestly, she used to be an oppressive bitch.\n\nHonestly her heal is fine mostly because you have to be smart with it and not just spam it, if you can hit your Q's then you basically instantly win lane.","replies":[]}]}
