Rather than using an ability on button cast it would show a range indicator and then cast after I let go of the button. This is super annoying and I can&#039;t play properly with this so I had to resort to playing normal casting. I&#039;m wondering if this is a new thing riot implemented or if my client is bugged?","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-04-14T08:30:53.667+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Summoner!\n\nWhat you're encountering is called _quick cast with indicator_.\n\nIf you want to change back to normal quick cast then scroll to the bottom of the hotkeys tab, and uncheck the box saying _\"Replace Quick Cast with Quick Cast with Indicator in the quickbind UI\"_.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Featherpirate","date":"2016-04-14T08:29:58.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fairly certain that there is an option to make the smart cast be on release like you describe, try looking underneath the settings for a checkbox about it perhaps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-04-14T08:28:26.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go into settings, Hotkeys, Scroll right down and untick \"Replace Quick Cast with Quick Cast with indicator in the quickbind UI\"\n\nThis will remove the indicator and make it cast on press.","replies":[]}]}
