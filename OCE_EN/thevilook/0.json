This is insanely frustrating for people who want to win it, as winning heavily depends on the luck you get (not getting matched with a combination of malz, wukong, yasuo, lux bot). This could be solved by adding a incentive to win.\n\nNow I know this sounds like a cash grab, however I think its actually a feasible idea. Riot already demonstrated they could do this with the Star Guardian event, where people were offered 1k RP for finishing it on S+. Since its Halloween is just around the corner, and Doombots is a heavily underappreciated gamemode, I'd love to see an incentive placed for defeating 100 Doombots\n\nOther than that, it took me 60 tries to win level 100 doom bots, and only 2 to get S+ on Star Guardian.","replies":[{"poster":"Bronze 6 Yasuo","date":"2017-10-28T04:35:35.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am one of those Yasuos","replies":[{"poster":"Bronze 6 Yasuo","date":"2017-10-28T04:36:10.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"(Srry)","replies":[]}]}]}
