I do not appreciate losing because a 4 man pre-made has all the power over a surrender vote causing me to lose the LP I worked for, over a damned red buff! I have access to video evidence if needed, but I want to see them punished for being such children and ruining the experience for others.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-08-21T10:11:43.922+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tough life buddy.
