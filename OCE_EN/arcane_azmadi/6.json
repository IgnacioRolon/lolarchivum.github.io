Who the hell created these things? Clearly all they&#039;re for is to level up an infinite number of spam accounts with 0 effort which can then be sold, but the thing is they have actually RUINED co-op vs AI.\n\nOh sure, you can easily win an AI game 4v5 while the stupid spam bot farms (or conclusively fails to farm, because it&#039;s as thick as pigshit) the jungle. Hell, last game we had to win basically 3v6 because there was also a very stupid lanebot that fed the fuck out of the enemy AIs (at least it helped split push a bit). But the last lobby I was in had THREE jungle farm bots in it. **_THREE!_** That would have been a 2v5 game and, even if it&#039;s 2 humans against a bunch of intermediate AIs, it&#039;s still a guaranteed loss because 2 players simply can&#039;t cover all 3 lanes and the AIs will eventually just split push down to your nexus). Obviously I dodged that one, but that would only cause some other poor schmuck to get stuck with it, or else people keep dodging until there's a game with 5 really fucking stupid bots all trying to farm the jungle at once. I'd _almost_ like to see that (in spectator mode, of course).\n\nRiot, either do something about these stupid fucking bots (they&#039;re all exactly the same too, either Jhin, Garen, Amumu or Brand with Smite and Heal, or in the case of one Brand bot I saw, Heal and Exhaust), or just disable Co-op vs AI queue so at the very LEAST these fuckers can&#039;t continue farming these accounts for sale so easily.","replies":[{"poster":"gekky","date":"2017-11-29T00:27:51.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"YES! Getting the same shit! Im still pretty green to the game and am learning roles outside of Support and it makes it so frustrating to learn! bots games are there to either dick around with mates or learn. I dont want to ruin peoples normal games when I play top lane and fail horrendously. That's why I learn in bots but when everyone on your team is a bot you cant learn! {{sticker:sg-shisa}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"CritTheClit","date":"2017-11-27T22:54:11.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"upvote my mate is trying to learn the game but cant cos  of this","replies":[]}]}
