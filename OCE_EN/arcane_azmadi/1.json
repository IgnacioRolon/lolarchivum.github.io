So I press it, and the launcher disappears for a second, but then the game client STILL refuses to launch and the launcher reappears again with the fucking 'Reconnect' button there again, sitting and taunting me. I even closed and reopened the launcher, but nothing changed. I guess I'm stuck here until my team remakes and I get hit with a leaver penalty for a game I was never even allowed to so much as _attempt_ to join.\n\nFucking class, Riot.\n\nUPDATE: The game was, predictably, remade and (rather oddly) I ended up in the post-game lobby, where I was tarred with the leaver penalty.\n\nFURTHER UPDATE: I went and tried to get into a co-op vs AI game to see if it would happen again. Oddly, I didn't seem to have a leaver penalty and was able to queue immediately. But yeah, it happened again. Game's COMPLETELY fucked. At least I warned my team this time.\n\nYET ANOTHER UPDATE: So I closed the launcher and ran the Hextech Repair Tool, using Forced Repatch to see if it helped. No, it only made it worse- now when I open the launcher, everything except the social bar on the right side is a blank black screen with just the tabs for 'Preseason', 'Overview', 'News' and 'Patch Notes' floating incongruously on it. So now even the _launcher_ is fucked as well as the game client. BRB, doing a reinstall through Hextech Repair.\n\nNEXT UPDATE: So I do the reinstall. And now the fucking thing won't run AT ALL. I try to run the LoL launcher, and right after the LoL logo appears I get an immediate bugsplat, nothing more. How is it possible that every single fucking thing I have tried to do to rectify this stupid problem has only made the game MORE FUCKED? So now I'm doing a Clean Uninstall/Reinstall, which is at least not bugsplatting yet.\n\nUPDATE+1: So after doing a complete clean reinstall I'm right back where I started. At least I got the launcher to run again. Still patching before I can actually try playing again.\n\nFINAL UPDATE: After doing the complete 100% uninstall/reinstall and repatch, I am LITERALLY right back where I fucking started- launcher works at least, but when I try to play a fucking GAME the client refuses to start and I'm stuck staring at the 'Reconnect' button on the launcher until it's over. Fucking hell, Riot.\n\nPOST-FINAL UPDATE: So after Wim Tinton suggested it could be an antivirus problem (and it was, despite absolutely no indications suggesting that) I was finally able to get first a custom game, then a co-op vs AI game to load. And all seemed well. Until the co-op vs AI game finished and the launcher got stuck on the \"Concluding game...\" screen interminably, eventually forcing me to close and restart the launcher again. Guess nobody will be getting any honor from me for the time being. For FUCK'S sake, Riot...","replies":[{"poster":"HungerX","date":"2019-11-21T06:05:12.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No anti-virus myself, though I am running via Wine.

It may be worth disabling your anti-virus entirely for just the install period to ensure all goes well if you can't find the exact file(s) to allow through.\n\nIf all else fails send a ticket to player support and they can usually point you in the right direction: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]},{"poster":"HungerX","date":"2019-11-20T06:04:16.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Experiencing the same thing :/","replies":[]}]}
