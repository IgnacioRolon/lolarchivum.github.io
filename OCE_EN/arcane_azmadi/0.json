I'm sick of doing everything right and losing anyway because my teammates just _can't fucking play._ I'm sick of trying hard, only to have my time wasted. I'm sick of being serious and doing my best.\n\nSo fuck it all. I don't care any more. I'm just going to do whatever the fuck I like and to hell with the consequences, because there are none. Lose the game? That was going to happen anyway no matter WHAT I do. Get reported? For what, being non-meta? Not giving a fuck makes me LESS toxic, not more, since if I don't care I don't get worked up.\n\nSo I'm going to play my Teemo support and my Poppy jungle and my Nami mid if I can get away with that one. And you're going to let me, because you can't do jack-shit about it. And I'm going to do pretty well on them (hey, just because I don't give a fuck doesn't mean I'm not TRYING) and you&#039;re going to feed like the noob you are and waste my efforts anyway. And I'm not going to care.\n\nAnd yes, I'm going to do it in ranked. And there's nothing you can do to stop me. Because I'm not breaking the rules- Riot doesn't mandate that you have to give a fuck. I'm not trolling. I'm playing seriously. I even buy Sightstone first on Teemo support because I'm not a useless retard like most of the supports I get teamed with (I think a 30-minute Sightstone is the record so far, not counting those who never buy one at all because \"wards are for faggots\"). I just don't care.\n\nJust thought I'd warn you.","replies":[{"poster":"ESC Static","date":"2015-07-23T07:01:27.086+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Out of interest what division in Bronze are you?

Well yeah he is **because of noobs**. If you bother to check his stats you can see that he's a reasonble player. I mean 95% of bronzes can't even get a KDA of over 3 on their favourite champ after 100 games. He can.

I can understand ***some*** of those games are support but this is happening pretty much every single game, at least pretty much every game over the past couple months.
