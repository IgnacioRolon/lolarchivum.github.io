Went into a ranked game, but after the lobby was finished and the game was supposed to start... it didn't. It just _sat_ there, not doing anything, with the client saying \"Game is about to start\" but never even _attempting_ to start. No crash, no error message, nothing, it just refused to do ANYTHING. I desperately tried closing the client and restarting it, but when it loaded again the client just said that I was already in a game like it does when you alt-tab out of a game to the client (despite me being fucking PROVABLY not in a game), and consequently not letting me do anything- no Reconnect button, because it believed I was actually in the fucking game. So I tried restarting again, but by that time my team had remade the game and I got stuck with a leaver penalty.\n\nI mean _come the fuck ON,_ Riot, I put up with enough bullshit from this game already without the fucking thing just deciding \"Nah, fuck it, I don't feel like working right now because fuck you.\"\n\nEDIT: Tried having another game, this time just a co-op vs AI one. THIS time when the game decided it didn't fucking feel like working it actually had the decency to crash PROPERLY, giving me an error message that \"A critical error has occurred and the process must be terminated\" and even letting me (futilely) attempt to reconnect, rather than telling me that it doesn't know what I'm talking about, I'm already in the fucking game. So apparently the entire fucking client is fucked.","replies":[]}
