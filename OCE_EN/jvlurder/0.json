(paying)","subforum":"Team Recruitment","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\r\nI am looking for a coach to help me get myself back in the Ranked system. I have lost confidence and have lost many games. My provisionals went great, although I would still like a coach to help me improve at playing League. I am willing to pay a named price, as long as I deem the coaching worthy (Still pay). \r\n\r\nI do not have a preferred role or lane, as I like others to play what they want or are most good at so I could have a better mindset about winning a game. I have Skype, but I do prefer just typing and chatting (not because I'm a squeaky little twelvie, I am just not a fan of talking to a screen). My aim, or purpose of looking for a coach is to become better at League.\r\n\r\nI can pay through Paypal, or Visa. I'm most likely found online in the afternoon till midnight (weekends are excepted). Comment below or add JVlurder if any coaches (that are at least Platinum III+) are interested in paid coaching.\r\n\r\n==\r\n\r\nMore information if needed:\r\nTop Champions: {{champion:24}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:58}}  ( a little iffy on Renekton )\r\nJungle Champions: {{champion:9}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:24}} \r\nMiddle Champions: {{champion:55}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:37}}  ( willing to learn ad mid )\r\nMarksman Champions: {{champion:51}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:67}} \r\nSupport Champions: {{champion:412}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:37}} \r\n\r\nCurrently Gold I (lucky provisionals, probably belong high silver low gold).\r\n\r\nDoesn't have to be Ranked coach, I actually would like to start off and learn and continue for a while on normal games. Not playing ranked until I have gotten my confidence back.","replies":[{"poster":"ESC Static","date":"2015-02-22T23:57:34.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've added you in game to be able to talk to you in real time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XSirCution","date":"2015-02-19T18:34:03.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can help you out a little bit\nWas D5 last season but bad promos so i'm in plat 5 now but yeah\nWould be happy to help, no pay neccesarry\nJust helping a bro out","replies":[]}]}
