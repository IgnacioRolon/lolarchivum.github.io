I have about 100k mastery points on him (useless info xd). I missed the skin &quot;Underworld {{champion:4}} &quot; and i know it comes back in a year, but im really excited about the skin. And i would like to know if riot is releasing a bundle soon (where underworld tf is in) Because i saw it before in June Bundles. (Creep KIllers) bundle.\r\n\r\nSo hopefully anyone that knows anything about it will reply, it might be a riot worker or just anyone that is clever around bundles and how they work.\r\n\r\nConclusion: I would like to know when underworld tf comes back. Will it be in a bundle soon or what? :)","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-01-01T07:48:47.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive disenchanted like 4 of them","replies":[]},{"poster":"KamikazeBombRun","date":"2017-01-01T05:52:40.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NO, GO AWAY, TF MAINS GO AWAY too many horrors.... too many 3 shots...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-01-01T05:33:36.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really know when/if it is coming back however we do know that Underworld Twisted Fate is classed as Legacy Skin meaning that it should come back around Harrowing time each year. Like you said though sometimes these skins can pop up through bundles and skin sales, and there are a few ways you can keep track of these to know if it comes out.\n\nThe first thing I would do is have a look out for any Riot posts to do with this months sale schedule. [For example we had the December sale schedule which you can have a look at here.](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales/december-sales-schedule-0) Along with that keep an eye out for any bundle announcements that you will see both on the front page of your client or in the [news section of the league of legends website.](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/)\n\nApart from that just keep your eye out on the front page of the client and have a look through sales for it. Usually these skins only come back through harrowing but if it does come back at another time Riot is sure to make an announcement about it. Hopefully you can get it  soon, its a very cool skin and I have it myself, however the next harrowing will be here before you know it so you can most likely get it then if they follow the theme of old Harrowing skins coming back like they usually do :3\n\n--\n\nGood luck mate and I hope this helps answer your question and gives you places to have a look out for where this skin might come out. If there are any more questions I can answer let me know.\n\n~Elam","replies":[]}]}
