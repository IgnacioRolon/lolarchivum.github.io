I am looking for either a duo to climb the ladder with or just a team to secure my place in a competitive nature. I am currently trying to climb the solo queue ladder but failing to do so (Usually thanks to some pretty bad or Toxic players) but i try to keep a positive mindset about it.\r\n\r\nJungle: I like to play Aggressive and Damage style Junglers like {{champion:421}}  and  {{champion:121}}  but can also play the Tank style ones like  {{champion:113}} and {{champion:79}} . I am more then versatile in learning new champions if needed. There are few champs i cant jungle with though, Like Lee Sin..\r\n\r\nMid: I like bursty brawling champions like {{champion:103}}  {{champion:1}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:127}} but can also play the AD Mids.\r\n\r\nFeel free to add me in game or post bellow!","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Sanity","date":"2015-05-16T04:02:31.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would be happy to duo with you or add you into the ranked team i'm in.
