I also was a  part of Team Works End playing Jungle for them and helping to reach Gold 1 before being removed due to my negativity towards the team and some of its members on the team, Which I highly regret now and have since tried to reach out and contact some of the members to apologise.\r\n\r\nLittle bit about myself, I am 22 Years old, Live primarily in Australia and have been playing League since Season 2 (Around the Sej-Naut Patch) and have since found myself on again off again with the game. I also play MMO's like World of Warcraft where I raid three nights a week (Wednesday. Thursday and Sunday 8-11PM AEST) which means during those times I am not available to play. Other then that I am mainly looking for friends to play with, I have a few that I play with every now and again but am not a big fan of playing alone. I am a chilled out laid back guy willing to trial for any team that wants me, I am also looking to achieve my goal of Plat This season, With or without a team.\r\n\r\nSo here is my application to any High Silver+ Teams out there that are looking for a fill, I am open to any position, My main role is Jungle but am willing to learn other roles if needed. If you wish to contact me feel free to add me in game or post below, I am interested to see if there are any teams out there willing to have me be apart.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-01-16T13:26:21.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm gold 5, also looking for a team.
