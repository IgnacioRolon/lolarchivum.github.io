I typically play with 2 or 3 other mates and a great many of our games have a plat or higher player on their team. Do you know what a plat jungler who mains Lee Sin can do to a bunch bronzies? It is not pretty.\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re just a bunch of happy, albeit terrible, little scrubs trying to have a good time together of an evening. Then we Q into a match with a Lee Sin that seems to be everywhere all at once. Our poor little jungler is scurrying around apologizing and feeling bad because all his lanes are getting camped at the same time and he doesn&#039;t know what to do. It&#039;s heartbreaking :(. \r\n\r\nOr maybe it&#039;s an Azir that can do things we didn&#039;t even know were possible from fuck knows where and all of a sudden turn what we thought was a lovely little pick in the jungle into a pentakill for himself. The list goes on.\r\n\r\nThen at the end of the match, when our spirits are finally worn down and we put up the /ff, we go and check on that Lee Sin or that Azir and he has that shiny, coverted platinum or diamond border next to his name and it makes us sad and confused.\r\n\r\nThank you for listening. Sincerely, a group of frustrated noobs.","replies":[]}
