I didnt play for a long time, but eventually started playing ranked again. I went on a huge winning streak, but it has become impossible to get my mmr back up. I started at 2120mmr (calculated on OP.GG) and after that I went on a 10 games win streak. my mmr didnt rise on that at all. I got +7s,+8s +9s. When I lose I get -31LP (all losses! -31) with a huge mmr drop each time. I kept my winrate high and I have like 75% winrate over the last 20 games, but my mmr just keeps dropping. I am now at 2010mmr. I started at 2120mmr. Why am I getting lower mmr even though I get a +-80% winrate? I don't get it. It makes it literally impossible to climb. I don't wanna blame the system, but I want an explaination about what I can do to improve my mmr. Even by winning it drops, so I got scared of playing ranked. Thanks for reading and hoping on good help :) Greets NY Crispy","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-01-16T23:35:51.226+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">calculated on OP.GG\n\nwell there's your problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arcanopulse","date":"2015-01-17T03:00:02.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You didn't link your main, so I can only suggest you got boosted.\n\nDon't get boosted, and then complain that you can't stay at a rank you don't deserve.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unnatural","date":"2015-01-17T00:48:42.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the reason that I havent played many games after I hit d5.
