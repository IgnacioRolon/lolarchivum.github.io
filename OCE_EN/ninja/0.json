With all the poro icons in the store giving you custom poros in the game mode, I was super excited to get a mini poro king for my poro.\r\n\r\nI got NOTHING, why Rito. All 5 icons you buy give you a cool poro, you can't give us one awesome one for free to hype the event?\r\n\r\nDont get me wrong the icon by itself is cool, but I was so keen for it ;(","replies":[{"poster":"GamingWithGameX","date":"2014-12-19T03:11:12.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hai {{champion:238}} Sup ummm i luv that icon its cool","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-16T16:31:23.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am annoyed as hell that you have to pay for temporary poro skins. Some of them should be unlockable, with the other half purchased. Or, at least, make half purchasable with IP...
