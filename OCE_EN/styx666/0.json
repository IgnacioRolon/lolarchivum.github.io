Logo pops up but nothing else. Task Manager has Lol_Launcher, 2 instances of Lol_patcher and 2 instances of Lol_patcher_ux but no client window pops up. Tried every fix mentioned all over the web including reinstalling, deleting LoL Launcher folder, RADS folder contents, resolution, winsock, you name it, I have tried it. No idea what has stopped it from opening. \r\n\r\nThe only other new things in that time was Plays.tv installing via Raptr (also tried uninstalling that) and an updated graphics driver which I have also rolled back with no success.\r\n\r\nShort of reinstalling Windows, I am running low on ideas...anyone else?","replies":[{"poster":"Styx666","date":"2016-03-09T09:24:17.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just paused protection on Kaspersky and the lanucher opened and is now patching.

If not, please do this to hopefully prevent the issue in the future.","replies":[]}]}]}
