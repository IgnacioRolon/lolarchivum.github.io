This happens when the game server you were playing on fails to communicate the game-end message to PVP.Net.\n\nThe ghost game will fix on itâ€™s own and usually lasts a maximum of 2 hours after this occurs. Sometimes this issue can be fixed by relogging into League of Legends. Occasionally, restarting your computer may help. These actions force the client to request a new update.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark3001","date":"2016-04-30T16:39:39.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same for me, can't get into client.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoodaBrine XD","date":"2016-04-30T03:10:59.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crane","date":"2016-04-29T16:48:46.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this has been resolved for me, but the ranked game that i won didnt count{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"lostmydinosaour","date":"2016-04-29T16:22:35.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"me too, from now is already 3hours still stuck at reconect stuff","replies":[]},{"poster":"TitusBlackwell","date":"2016-04-29T14:21:55.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also stuck in reconnect screen :/ We won our hexakill game and went to lobby but couldn't make a room, then when I reset the client it told me I need to reconnect to a game that either has finished or never actually got created >.<","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeeSinuous","date":"2016-04-29T13:31:58.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am also stuck :( And my promos game had 2 people dc :'(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Seaniiboii","date":"2016-04-29T13:30:40.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i finished a normal game an got stuck on the reconnect screen to... an i cant do anything about it, log out an in an it ask's me if i wanna reconnect to the game","replies":[]}]}
