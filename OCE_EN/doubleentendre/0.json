AD jg ori goes way negative and i get banned for calling them a %%%. This is your idea of making the game better? You need to change your definition of toxic to making it impossible for your team to win and not anything that can be typed on the keyboard. that&#039;s what the mute button is for. if i get mad and you don&#039;t like what im saying, mute me. your fucking logic makes no sense. that&#039;s why your game is dying among other reasons.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2018-07-20T08:30:38.307+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh look another moron saying the game is dying.\n\nYeah that explains why on OCE alone there are over 50,000 new accounts playing ranked in Season 8.\nIf the game is dead, why is LoL ALWAYS the number one game on Twitch?\n\nThere are more people playing now than every before, just because you bitch and moan doesn't mean the game is actually losing players.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellopolite","date":"2018-07-20T16:57:35.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"same idiot that believes in australian equality, talk about falling for the meme. anoooosognosiaaaad","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hellopolite","date":"2018-07-20T06:42:52.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Poor idiots should ban the lowlife that doesn't know how to use mute function rather then try to surpress free expression of speech and live in a non soyed world aka reality.

Ok, let me articulate myself on your opinion. \n\nYou seem to be the sort that think words bring no consquences. This ussually mean the person is young, or severely lack the social guidances to know what to says to fit in with the norm. \"You're not gonna be popular with the ladies, i'll tell you this now.\"\n\nYou're talking about this \"non soyed\" reality. But lets take a step back. Would you insults others so freely, like you do in league, in a face to face interaction? Especially strangers?. Not to mention the conflict is usualy personal and not political.\n\nThe reason most people find it easy to lash out online, is due to it anonymous environment. In another words, they viewed it as a virtual interaction with no consequences to their name \"Real name and details\". If you bring in reality, where your name and details are put up for public viewing, lets say; Social media, facebook, twitter and such. Believe me, you would filter your words to make it presentable. \n\nHalf the nonsense people spewed in league, they wouldnt replicate it where it would lay them bare. Why? because they know what they are saying is not a debate, but straight up \"Fighting talk\". \n\nI dont like the PC cultures aswell but, i hate it even more when people like you abused whatever you dont like as such. There is a big different between Free speech and being an asshole.","replies":[]}]}]}
