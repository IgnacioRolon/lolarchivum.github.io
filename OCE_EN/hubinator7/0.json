Current champion pool (which i aim to improve regardless).\n\nNot really a weakness but i also mistly play late game scaling champs that for the most part require a dect bit of peel so usually the first 10-12 minutes i am pretty weak comparitive to other champion selections.\n\nQuestions for you:\n\nWhen do you play? \n\nWhen do you train?\n\nWhat do you expect?\n\nFeel free to add me IG: Aspire nothing","replies":[{"poster":"hubinator7","date":"2016-04-05T06:47:31.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Questions for you:\n\nWhen do you play?\nwe mostly play in the afternoon around 3pm to 12am depending whats on in real life.\n\nWhen do you train?\nwe will be training the afternoons because some people have school.\n\nWhat do you expect?\nwe expect you to listen and attend practice when possible so you can improve your skills.\nwe expect you to not flame anyone else on the ranked team if they make a really noob mistake you can tell them about it after the game to help them improve on it and tell them what they could have done instead.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Drizzer","date":"2016-04-04T19:49:18.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey i am happy to be a sub i am silver 3 but when i was in NA i was plat 4 or 3 cant remember so ye :)\nI am a ADC main","replies":[{"poster":"hubinator7","date":"2016-04-04T20:51:26.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sick bro send me an email or message on league when you can and ill add you on skype or whatever","replies":[{"poster":"Drizzer","date":"2016-04-05T04:20:54.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ye sure fam","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"King Bee","date":"2016-04-05T02:58:49.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"gold 1 top laner, im looking for a ranked team to join, dedicated to improving, and adapting to the meta, add IGN Pixel Panda","replies":[]},{"poster":"abnormalx","date":"2016-04-05T01:17:23.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"D4 sup main, but played alot of top, specially tanks, add IGN abnormalx","replies":[]}]}
