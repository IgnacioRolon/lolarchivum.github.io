I have to cope with leave penalties because your client crashes randomly and when i finally get into a game after 2 hours because between crashes and people leaving queue... that's what it takes! I get a freaking Nasus op that goes 0/7/0 by minute 5 basically... and what do you do about those players.... NOTHING.... utterly... NOTHING\r\n\r\nWhat about you penalise everyone with leave that goes with a KDA lower than negative 5 or even negative 6 wit a leave penalty of 20 minutes?\r\n\r\nand I mean KDA because if you are a sup you could be 0/6/40","replies":[{"poster":"Killiak","date":"2019-11-20T05:25:56.491+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Buddy people have bad games, you have to understand this.\n\nNot every game will someone do amazing, bad games happen. If you tell me that you've never had a game like that Nasus you're a filthy liar. You can't be punished for having a bad game, if it happens consistently enough and they arent just having a bad game then reports will add up and they will receive suspensions. \n\nI really don't think that you should be giving an input on such a topic if this is the knowledge you have on it, if riot did your method of banning and suspending queue times, the player count would drop so fast and the game would die.","replies":[{"poster":"Grouchy Poro","date":"2019-11-21T18:16:27.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"people have bad games\" not an excuse why is the \"people have bad games\" only ever in my team eveyr single match","replies":[]},{"poster":"The White Hatter","date":"2019-11-20T06:27:23.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely understand that people have bad games, i've had them... but when you have a bad game you don't keep just going in after your 4th consecutive death - you stay under tower and farm and wait until later in the game.\n\nObviously if something like that were to be implemented then the games in which i've been tilted and not gave a crap about it would have costed me queue time.. and i'm totally fine with that as in those game I probably was an arse-ol to the other people in the team.\n\nI'm not saying ban people with kda lower than -6, I'm saying make them cope with a 15 minute queue block... yeah would be slightly higher times for those who don't like to feed nor like people feeding but at the same time the games would have higher quality (in theory).

That's pure run off the mill racism that should have triggered alarms on RITO's side... but nope.. the guy has been playing for quite a while now I've met him in game a few times as said before.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The White Hatter","date":"2019-11-20T06:08:04.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely understand that people have bad games, i've had them... but when you have a bad game you don't keep just going in after your 4th consecutive death - you stay under tower and farm and wait until later in the game.\n\nObviously if something like that were to be implemented then the games in which i've been tilted and not gave a crap about it would have costed me queue time.. and i'm totally fine with that as in those game I probably was an arse-ol to the other people in the team.\n\nI'm not saying ban people with kda lower than -6, I'm saying make them cope with a 15 minute queue block... yeah would be slightly higher times for those who don't like to feed nor like people feeding but at the same time the games would have higher quality (in theory).
