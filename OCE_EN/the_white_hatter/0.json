That means your personal score actually is based on not only how you played but also how the rest of the people on your team played. This actually makes sensed for those people who play 5:5 ranked games, those who choose their team to be how it is.\n\nNow, for those in solo queue this doesn't really makes sense. Yes, wining a game does mean that yo are probably good, but you could also being carried the heeeeck out of it. At the same time, losing a game could have been because the other people was having a bad day, or there was one or 2 feeders/trolls on your team. \n\nNow, what if you were actually ranked by how YOU performed in the game based on Kills, Deaths, Assist, skills landed, etc? That would actually give a more accurate rank of the player itself rather than how a game ended up. Let's be honest, if you put Faker on a team with a few feeders/trolls and you make them play against an all Diamond team, chances are, Faker's team will lose even tho he would have done really well.\n\nSo, Riot, People... what can be done about this?","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2017-01-03T14:43:52.327+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is a terrible idea, always has been always will be.\n\nIt promotes a \"Just play for me\" style, your team means nothing, and your better off just chasing down that kill instead of getting that tower.","replies":[{"poster":"Mortis Ex","date":"2017-01-04T03:09:50.300+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Valor Carrys,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=2rXnl1yq,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-01-03T14:43:52.327+0000)\n>\n> This is a terrible idea, always has been always will be.\n> \n> It promotes a &quot;Just play for me&quot; style, your team means nothing, and your better off just chasing down that kill instead of getting that tower.\n\nExcept towers are a counted stat.

If the scoring system is worked out properly then surely it could be used to judge that you played very well and were let down by a bad team / bad luck and only lose half LP or something. \nWith my main, Diana, my averages for this season  170.3 CS 3.36:1 KDA 11.1 / 5.2 / 6.4 but only 57% win with 14 games.
