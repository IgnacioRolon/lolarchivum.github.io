Lately I&#039;ve been getting quite a few game in which people believe that the support role is limited to:\r\n\r\n**- Staying in bot lane only until laning phase is done no matter how much time it takes for the adc to achieve that.\r\n- Not take any kills at all\r\n- Constantly ward around the map\r\n- Peel for the adc no matter what\r\n- Never be the one to split push even if no one else is doing it**\r\n\r\nWhile I do agree that the support role has (to an extent) to cover some of those points, I do also believe that there are some other things getting overlooked.\r\n\r\nIn LoL as well as other games I&#039;ve always liked to support, but not just mindlessly following the adc or party and healing or sacrificing other aspects of the support role. What I like doing is to have an overall look of the game, support the whole team rather than just one character and even taking kills.\r\n\r\nThe way i like to play support is more like:\r\n\r\n- Stay in lane for 3 or 4 levels ( 6 or 7 if the adc is not doing so hot and needs extra help)\r\n- Roam and help mid and jungler to get kills and/or objectives or even escape death if they&#039;re in a risky situation and ward (shouldn&#039;t be the only one warding tho)\r\n- Take some kills here and there and try to get support items during the early stage of the game (early gold can help a support get a SS ($800) or a few control wards ($75 each) and ward to give vision benefiting the whole team vs a BF ($1500) on an ADC to only benefit him/her) \r\n- Peel for adc and others without risking a double kill, if you know it&#039;ll be a double kill, then don&#039;t go in\r\n- Take control of the mini map and ping other so keep them informed (everyone should ping for their lane tho, because if the support is mid fight, you can&#039;t expect him/her to be looking at mini map during a fight to check if the midlaner has disappeared) \r\n- If no one is caring for the lanes and letting them get pushed and minions are destroying torrets, first ping your teammates, if they are still not going (not because they&#039;re in fight but because they prefer to chase the enemy team) then you can take lead and go, clean push a bit and come back to the team.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve noticed that the games I&#039;ve played with people with my same mindset re: support role we actually had heaps of fun and everyone covered their basics quite well, while on the other hand, when i was forced to play on the first style people were a bit toxic and greedy for kills.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts? \r\nPlease don&#039;t rant, I&#039;m just curious to know what the community think that the support role should cover.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-08-28T10:27:46.397+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your ADC is shit, don't be afraid of going to support mid or w/e.\n\nSupport the team, not just the ADC.","replies":[]},{"poster":"diamondninja855","date":"2017-08-31T04:11:55.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have one question.

I'm refering to the following situation:\n\nYou ADC, APC, or whoever gets caught in a 3v1, you spot it and start going there to help him either get out or get the kills. As you approach you notice that person is with only a bit of their HP left and the 3 enemies are half health or they're simply too fed. In that case, instead of going there knowing that the enemy will get a double kill if you get closer to help rescue, then run the other way.\n\nThat should clarify both questions :P","replies":[{"poster":"diamondninja855","date":"2017-08-31T18:27:50.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh okay.

In the duo lane, we don't need to farm so we can pay more attention on mini-map and warm others lane about existing enemy jungler. Ward up aggressively/offensively depends on different situations, and more important, to think about whether you should snowball mid with your jungler, or stay at bot with your adc to keep him safe.\n\nTo be honest, this role called SUPPORT for a reason :D \n\nTo me, being a support was like:\n\n    - Stay cool\nYou can be aggressive but remember to stay cool (This always on my list No.1 :D)\n\n    - Keep warding\nOf course, you need to ward depends on what is gonna happen. \n    If your lane is pushing, you want your ward spread most likely into your enemy's jungle to prevent a gank or cleaning your enemy's vision in tri-bush for creating an opportunity to dive with your other teammates.\n    If your lane is taking heavy pressure, ward your own jungle to prevent being gank.\n    Warding on enemy jungle's camp is always a good way to obtain the information about your enemy's jungler.\n    ALWAYS KEEP A VISION WARD IN YOUR BAG, 2 IF NECESSARY!!!!\n\n    - Always stay with your teammates, never walk alone\nAvoid clean the vision alone, you might be one-shot even your team have a big lead in game.\n\n    - Go gank after you secured the vision\nGo gank, but ensure your adc will not die because of surprising gank.\nGank with your jungler or invade into enemy's jungle, this is always an option to decrease other lanes pressure.\n\n    - In teamfight, keep your skills for peeling.\nYes, peeling, but not only adc, it depends on who can do the most dmg on your team at the moment( Of course, in most of time, it's adc/apc). Don't use all your skills for killing, especially for killing a tank .\n\nFor what I can conclude my sup main for these two years: Support always the role that cover the lake of your team and protect the strongest point of it. \n\nCheers :D","replies":[{"poster":"The White Hatter","date":"2017-08-28T11:48:59.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank dude!!!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-08-28T10:08:03.824+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Role of Support - Support main right here\n\nMake plays (better if you're duo'd or better with the team)\nRoam mid early if bot is going nowhere, or if your ad just wants a chill farm lane\nPeel hard in teamfights, prioritise ad > ap > everyone else\nMap awareness, chances are your ad is blind so its your job to make up for it\nCommunicate as much as you can\n\nAND MOST IMPORTANTLY VISION CONTROL\n- Baron - from about 25-30 mins in, depending on whether grouping has started\n- Drake - always, sighstone first buy (if you can afford) then keep that warded as long as you can, if waiting for respawn drop a ward between 1:30-1:00 to maximise vision time\n- Enemy buffs (control, but normal wards work too)\n- Ally buffs, if you have no outer towers (again control, but normal wards are just as useful)\n- De-tilt your team if you can, inflate their ego if you need to","replies":[{"poster":"The White Hatter","date":"2017-08-28T10:21:47.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\nThanks for your response!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FatCakedJismbe","date":"2017-09-05T08:29:50.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends on your rank level but it is better not to leave you adc alone.

Calming the flame i feel seems to be a side job for the support\n\n> Roam and help mid and jungler to get kills and/or objectives or even escape death if they're in a risky situation and ward (shouldn't be the only one warding tho)\n\nThis is a risky scenario ive gone over many time in my head , especially when playing {{champion:432}} - ADC's lose alot of presence in lane when youre not there , i'd like to hope that the adc could stay safe but naturally they're at risk when trying to farm with the enemy {{champion:89}} who's ready to do some tower diving and hurr durr press R. Unless the circumstances allow it - say double kill bot and your adc has recalled +you have decent HP , only then would i look to roaming and warding which leads to my pet peeve with warding on a basic SS\n\nRoaming and putting in deep wards as a support isnt particular helpful for your lane , not due to the lack of presence but your ward number in general. By time you ward dragon , river brush/tri depending on what side and perhaps one of the bot lane bushes youre out of wards. Either you go back and lose that pressure even more or you rely on your adc to ward (laughs in support). If you can keep 2 pinks up and your adc wards( hah!) you could do more offensive warding , but in the end if youre low health and theres a fed {{champion:19}} , wards wont be saving you from that hehe.\n\nIn the end it really comes down to the individual and the game theyre playing at that time. Ive left fed dravens alone for to ward and they got a double kill while i was gone . Deep wards help track the enemy but hey it doesnt hurt for your jungler to ward /pink it . ADC dies because youre mid , you get flamed - its really a case of weighing up the what ifs and potential from your actions. My adc is trash ? , sadly you still need them.
