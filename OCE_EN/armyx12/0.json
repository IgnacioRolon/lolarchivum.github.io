But, for those of us who may miss these games live, could we get access to VODs of these games somewhere so we can watch them in our own time? I haven't found any links for anything like this and think this could be worth doing. Please correct me if there is a location for either of these. Thanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Quayer5","date":"2015-02-05T13:46:23.407+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnkfmQV7fyM","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-02-06T07:31:53.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nYou can find vods at the link below\n\nhttp://oce.lolesports.com/vods","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-02-05T21:04:42.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.twitch.tv/riotgamesoceania All streams are recorded and stored on the users profile.","replies":[]}]}
