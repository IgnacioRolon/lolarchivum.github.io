I don't blame you, there are 128 of them.\n\nIs it that you can't click on the correct target to get your spells to work? I don't blame you, that is a major issue with MoBA games, just get an AOE champion and hope for the best.\n\nIs it that you can't look at the map and screen in conjunction and keep dying to ganks? Than choose someone who can farm with ease and not have to be in your face.\n\nThere are options, but it simply limits the champions you can choose. Although, choosing only a handful of them will determine your weakness and strengths and allow you to get good enough with a couple of them that you don't think anymore allowing you to focus more on the enemy and the map than your own decisions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-11-24T23:55:28.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont multitask.
