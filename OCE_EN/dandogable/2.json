This was rarely a problem back in season 5 with the old queue. You&#039;d have the eventual leaver, but it&#039;d be because of somebody being abusive of trolling. Now it&#039;s just genuine laziness. I have joined 9 queues in a row now with somebody leaving, and it&#039;s getting incredibly annoying, especially since NOTHING is getting done about it. I&#039;m sick of trying to get my elo higher and it getting nowhere, because people are just plain lazy. Why should I waste 15 minutes (no joke) waiting around for nothing...Please thumb this up so Riot can see this, because I can safely say that a lot of people at the moment are getting pissy with this system too, and something needs to be done about it.","replies":[]}
