Sure, I swore at them, but I suffer from mental illness and anger easy when I&#039;m told that I got boosted and that I&#039;m shit. I now have a chat restriction, which means i wont get my rewards, and I heard that their entire team; all who abused me, didn&#039;t get a restriction. That&#039;s both hypocritical that I get no season rewards, and they do, BECAUSE I WAS DEFENDING MYSELF, and unfair that my case isn&#039;t read thoroughly enough to be seen that I wasn&#039;t in the wrong. And by the way, for people that are going to post on this and call me a whiner and insult me, you&#039;re literally proving my point on why this is unfair to me.","replies":[{"poster":"punpun irl","date":"2015-11-11T06:35:37.536+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You were very toxic to my team including me (I was the Hecarim in one of those games) i did nothing to provoke you my team didn't even abuse you, you just took a joke seriously. in my eyes they were defending themselves against you. You could've just muted them btw... you were also saying stuff like \"at least i'm going to get the plat border at the end of the season\" (Or something along the lines)  and told a member of my team in the endgame chat to kill himself. :( {{champion:32}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"casaj","date":"2015-11-11T06:57:03.502+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://puu.sh/lgcVj/608c722bda.jpg\n\nThat's the proof of dandogable being mean to us. \n\nCourtesy of XaX1 for taking screenshot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"cool cat","date":"2015-11-11T06:56:13.424+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i understand that sometimes things can get a little heated in game, but it is not an excuse to tell someone to kill themselves in post game chat, http://puu.sh/lgcVj/608c722bda.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"WinterSolsticee","date":"2015-11-11T11:27:59.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey well I saw casaj's photo and I noticed what it was. I don't want to butt into this and be rude about everything and criticize everyone but everyone was at fault tbh. One, Dandogable, you got provoked the enemy team and said mean things back or it might have the been the other way who knows. My friend and his ranked team was also at fault for replying and provoking you back. The best option for both of you was to just mute each other... <_<\"\nWelp but then you posted this on social media and made yourself a laughing stock because of this evidence of you being very mean to the enemy team. Good job on both sides.","replies":[{"poster":"casaj","date":"2015-11-12T14:41:45.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you sound like that we got sad or upset about him being mean to us. ｡◕‿‿◕｡\nalso it was more like we were both shouting insults at each other. rather than what he said \"for defending myself against their abuse\"","replies":[]}]}]}
