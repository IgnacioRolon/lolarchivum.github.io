I mean, it has its perks which the other ranked queue didn&#039;t. But two big things I&#039;ve noticed, which isn&#039;t exactly riots fault, is either people are retarded and can&#039;t lock in their picks and make everybody wait another 4 damn minutes to play a game (which ends up chaining into about 12 minutes, mind you), and people not communicating in the slightest. With the old system, at least you could type in what role you wanted and it would encourage people to talk more. As I&#039;m typing this, it&#039;s a 4th queue I&#039;ve entered in a row where somebody hasn&#039;t locked in their god damn champ, and the last pick (who is jungle mind you) wont change his god damn summoner into a smite, or listen to acceptable picks for the team comp. For example, my team is lucian, lulu, wukong and galio so far, so not bad. Very high levels of aoe and cc. But then douche bag mcgee says &quot;nup fuk dat&quot; and goes udyr with smite ignite, without even talking it over with anybody. I get it, we all have freedom to pick whatever we want, but this is ranked queue&#039;s, take it with a bit of seriousness. Communication is key to win games, so why is it that hardly anybody consults with the team anymore? It&#039;s retarded...","replies":[]}
