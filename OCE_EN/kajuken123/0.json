Leveling an account means playing games with noobs, which i usually stomp due to being a veteran Diamond player. People accused me of using scripts for either zed or lee (which i obviously didnt) and they threatened a report. I obviously ignored it because there is a lot of hate in the community and people tend to report for no reason. But then I noticed that my smurf was banned for using &quot;unauthorized third party programms&quot; which is silly. Is there any way to prevent this or am i forced to play worse on a smurf just to not get banned?","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-08-22T21:16:22.675+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya :)\n\nIt is my belief that they don't ban you for scripting (no matter how many times you get reported) UNLESS they find a suspicious 3rd Party Programme. Chances are, all of those reports were enough for the system to scan you and find something. It doesn't have to be scripts. Maybe they found LoLWiz? Or Mobalytics? Or perhaps using a Custom Skin? At that point all the system cares about is that you have lots of script reports and that a 3rd Party Programme was found. \n\nI would suggest sending a ticket to Riot Support, making your case clear, and also asking for more information about your ban. \n\nI hope this helps :)\n\nThanks :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-08-23T02:03:52.561+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a couple good responses already, but I just want to add a bit more.\n\nYou definitely shouldn't be getting banned for playing well, even on a new account in low level games. When it comes to smurfs in pre-30 games, Riot stated (over a year ago now, but still relevant) that they have \"pretty good detection methods that quickly separate new players from experienced smurf accounts in the early levels.\" [[Source](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/community/q/lets-talk-smurfs-snow-and-bans-ask-riot)] so you shouldn't really have issues with being match with new or very low skill players. It certainly shouldn't require you to intentionally play worse just so you don't get banned.\n\nI've seen more than a few cases of players who've been banned for 3rd party software who didn't know why it had happened. There's usually nothing that stands out based on the information they provide, however I've noticed that (more often than not) they do say they've previously used public computers to play, which can trigger such a ban if you're not careful. You'll never know what programs may be running in the background of a public computer unless you check, so always open Task Manager (or any relevant equivalent) and check. It does take only a minute or two, after all.\n\nAs Little Witch Eve has already stated, your best option is to contact [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) and either ask for more information (you might not get any, considering it's a 3rd party software ban) and/or appeal the ban (there's certainly no guarantee it will be revoked).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-22T23:56:38.795+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"> to have an enviroment where i can try out new things without the pressure of losing.\n\nThis is called 'Normals'. \n\nNo need to ruin new player's games just so you don't have to worry about losing. \nJust because they're 'noobs' doesnt mean they forfeit the right to have fun in a fair game.\n\nIf you get stomped in your own elo, you get to make a smurf and go and fuck over someone else so that you don't have to feel bad. But if people in lower elos get stomped _(notably by Diamond Veterans who can't play in their own elo)_, they have no escape, they can't just make a smurf and go somewhere else. They have to live with it constantly.\n\nAs for being banned, I'm no player behaviour expert, but I highly doubt they'd ban you for hearsay alone, I believe they have systems that know wether you were scripting or not _(very accurate ones)_. If you were banned for third party programs, I'm guessing like Little Witch Eve says, there was probably something else running in the background.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Syringe","date":"2017-09-03T04:14:36.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Similar things happened to me, in fact I was permanently banned.","replies":[]}]}
