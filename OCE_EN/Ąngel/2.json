In this particular game he played rammus, and every single person in his team TOLD him to try and int to 100 deaths. Because they \"were tired of stomping so hard in every game\" --> one of their words exactly.\r\nDespite this, they were asses and 2 of them reported him as well as the entire enemy team.\r\n\r\nThe in-game chat logs prove he had their blessing, yet the guy that reviewed his ban still said the ban was justified.\r\n\r\nSo.. be careful who you int with, even if they tell you to you can still get in trouble for it (absolutely stupid)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-12-02T08:51:14.619+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"If it was a custom it would be different, but given that this was done in a norm, old mate more than likely had a rather negative effect on the *enemy* team's experience.

You can get banned for inting in a coop vs ai game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-12-05T10:05:48.168+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes but if you did it in a custom and had a chat log proving that all parties agreed that would be a valid defence. If OP had only been reported by *their* team in this case they may have also had a strong enough defence to warrant a warning and removal of the ban (which a co-op vs Ai would also fall into the category of).\n\nAs it is, they clearly had a negative impact on the enemy team, who did not agree prior to the game to the terms OP and his team were setting.\n\nI'm not saying it's not a grey area, because it is, but ultimately, our actions affect the enemy team as well even if it's generally to a lesser extent. They do deserve consideration given that they were stuck with a negative situation they had no reason to expect. \n\nI can understand and respect both the argument for removal and the argument for the punishment remaining, but personally with the inforrmation available I do lean the way that Support ultimately went. Mostly though, the point of my comment was to explain the why.","replies":[{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-12-05T21:45:31.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"enemy teams totally complain about free wins/gold","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
