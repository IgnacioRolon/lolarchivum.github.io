Join a premade team.**\n Playing as a ranked 5 will definitely lessen your chances of being matched with trollers/afks/other toxins. It also allows you to become familiar with the play patterns of your teammates (so you don't have to keep adjusting your style every game) and you have way better communication. With the implementation of a dynamic queue where this is possible, there is literally no reason not to. You also get lots of cool bonuses like extra IP, mastery points and Hextech stuff.\n\n>**2. Play comfort picks rather than counter picks.**\nA lot of people in bronze get caught up in trying to play counter picks, even if they have no idea how to play the champion. Same happens when the \"FOTM OP\" isn't banned. A lot of people are going to be playing \"op\" champs in order to get out, and the likelihood of them sucking is high (look at all the bronze vaynes and yasuos). Playing a comfort pick means that you will not only have better matchup and skill knowledge, it means that you have more options on how you want to play (aggro/safe/roam). Keep in mind that your comfort picks may be banned, I would suggest picking up a couple of champs (also helpful if you are last pick and your team is missing something like a tank). On top of this, play easy champs. Champs that aren't too mechanically intensive, so that new players will be able to identify what they do (a lot of bronze is made up of new players), no point playing Eve/Yasuo when it is highly likley your team wont know how to synergise with them.\n\n>**3. Get super good at two roles.**\nDynamic queue allows you to choose two roles, so you have 100% chance of getting of your fave/best roles. Pick up a few comfort champs in each, learn all there is to know about them so you know things like build paths and matchups like the back of your hand. Fill is your worst enemy. Leave filling roles to normals. \n\n>**4. Revisit some of the basic league skills.**\nThings like [CS](http://imgur.com/orWUCKH), [warding](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/support-guide-map-control-warding-344910), positioning, [teamcomps](http://www.liquidlegends.net/forum/lol-strategy/476270-picks-and-bans-understanding-team-compositions), and [being a nice person and encouraging your team](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/). If you need help with some of this, you could[ consider hiring a coach](http://www.lol-coaching.com). \n\n>_Note: also check your masteries and rune pages are the best they can be._\n\n>**5. Keep a ranked diary. **\nMost of my improvement comes from my ranked diary. After every game I write down who I was playing, my score, CS, wards placed, LP gained/lost and a quick summary of the game. I also like to write down 3 things I did well, and 3 things I need to improve. That way, you are really processing the game and learning from your mistakes. It also gives you something to consciously work towards improving in the next game. \n\nGood luck, may the elo be ever in your favour ♥","replies":[{"poster":"Ąngel","date":"2016-04-25T02:24:09.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhh\nThis actually does help c:\nI'm seriously guilty of wanting to counterpick.

If you can't take a tower, if your lanes are stalemated or winning and then enemy team is visible or dead then you should take dragon. Focusing all your attention on baron and dragon can often throw games and give enemy kills, other times it might be stolen by the enemy jungler, or that if you're taking dragon, they might try and take an objective instead. \n\nMy next tip is, don't assume your opponent is stupid or that you're smarter. Sure, this can be true in many instances especially in lower divisions, however assuming these things can be equally catastrophic to you. Leading yourself to making a mistake that you shouldn't. When it seems like he's doing something dumb he might know something that you don't.  For example, the enemy toplaner has low hp, while you still have half. He comes to engage you, it seems common sense to fight him, but your lane is unwarded, and you don't have your flash. You still choose to fight him but suddenly the enemy ammumu shows up from the fog of war, lands his bandage toss, stunning you, allowing them to finish you off. \n\nUnderstand the strengths and weaknesses of your opponent. Know their cooldowns, their power spikes, their abilities. \n\nFurthermore pick for the team, sometimes picking a champion you know and love is great, it really is, and can carry you through divisions, but you also gotta think beyond the solo lane, and offer as much as you can in the way of utility and power to fit your team composition.  It's good especially in lower divisions to become familiar with junglers like ammumu, or toplaners or midlaners like Lux. I must also stress on the importance to only pick champions you know how to play and how to maximize their effectiveness. \n\nDon't always consider your champion pick in the best scenario where you win your lane. Personally when I make a first pick, I like to think of a worst case scenario in where I would pick a champion I can safely farm with and avoid getting picked off even if I am counterpicked.

We both finished at the bottom of bronze. In bronze elo, I easily won my lane but failed to carry teamfights and the team in general. When I was having really bad teams one time, I dropped down to bronze 5 where I stayed. I then became carefree and was like ** ranked and continued to spam it without caring for lp. That was when I started to climb and learn and adapt on the way, I went all the way to silver 2 in preseason 5 with syndra, kat, akali etc. \n\nWhen season 5 finally started I played my provisional and got bronze 4 again. This made me angry and I tried climbing again. I failed my bronze 4 promos 4 TIMES. Always some bad teams to get in my way. When I finally got to bronze 3 on my 5th promos I went on a winning streak, skipped some divisions (the more wins and streaks u have, the more lp and more chance of skipping divisions, at that point I was getting 30 lp per game). I constantly duoed with my duo partner and we had like a 90 percent win rate together and we both climbed. At the end of season 5 I finally ended up in gold 5 (as did my duo) using the season 5 statik shiv, infinity edge and trinity force yasuo build.\n\nIn preseason 6 I went up to gold 2 playing leblanc (before teamfights I would usually catch the enemy adc's out, farming down their mid lane by w, r, q and e resulting in a 4v5 teamfight) my duo partner got gold 3 in preseason and then the new season started. I got silver 1 in my provisionals and climbed to gold (currently gold 3 now). I played less ranked games and My duo partner went on to plat. Funny how we were once trapped in bronze once. We play a lot of roles but we both main mid. My advice to get out of bronze 5 is constantly spam ranked, learn to adapt in matchups (e.g. once I was playing leblanc against galio and galio was supposed to be leblancs biggest counter, I constantly auto attacked him in lane as my autos were ad and dodged his skillshots and got 3 kills on my before I roamed and carried the game), League is not all about winning lane, it is how to progress from thereon forth","replies":[{"poster":"iLiKeTuRtLeS","date":"2016-04-25T04:14:16.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a copy and paste from one of my earlier posts.\nTLDR: 1. you have to adapt to lane matchups\n2. you gotta know how to progress from lane into teamfights and the game\n3. find a duo partner of which you two can carry games (e.g. mid and jg/top and jg/adc and supp/adc and jg)\n4.
