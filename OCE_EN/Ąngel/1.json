I doubt anything will come of it but whatever.\nIf my account get&#039;s suspended or BANNED god forbid I&#039;m going to be seriously hurt. (I have no idea how the reporting system works so rip)\n\nOkay, so let&#039;s see.\nHaving 6300+ ip earlier I decided to buy Kindred, because they&#039;re a champion I&#039;ve never had the pleasure of playing.\nGoing into the norms match queue, of course I wanted to play them, so I instantly called ADC once a match was found and low and behold, somebody else called adc a second afterward.\n\nThis guy instalocked Jinx, demanding he got adc first, and so I asked our other team-mates who called adc first. (since theres been instances before where it shows up differently on your screen and all that)\nOne guy says Jinx, another me.\nInstantly after the guy said me he revoked his statement and said Jinx which I found fishy but whatever.\n\nHeres my first fuckup. I went Kindred regardless and just stated I was going support. (YES, I know, bad move but I knew we could win)\n\nIn the loading screen, GUESS WHAT, all four teammembers were in a clan. How lucky for Jinx. She had friends to back her up.\nOkay, in game, Jinx bit at me a few times at the start however it all went somewhat smoothly until near the end of the game when we were losing pretty heavily because our mid fed the opposing Aurelion earlier. \n\nBoth the Jinx and our naut started saying in all chat &quot;REPORT KINDRED, SO TOXIC&quot; &quot;KINDRED TOLD US TO KILL OURSELVES&quot;\nThey just started saying all of this incorrect bull about me when I hadn&#039;t even been talking to them about anything other then what I was going to do. (like warding)\nThey told the other team all of this WHILE telling ME to kill myself, and that our loss was my fault, and mine alone when, I went 4/4 and every other team mate went negative. //ugh\n\nI don&#039;t deny in any way I could have played better, and made better choices in and out of game.\nBut, I just don&#039;t react well at all to being ganged up on. And I didn&#039;t at all try to hurt them in any way shape or form. But clearly they tried to hurt me.\n(and I don&#039;t react at all well to people telling me what to do, but thats just a personality thing)\n\nAnyone else been ganged up on like this? Also, if four people report you in one game can that be enough to get your accounted suspended or worse?\nI don&#039;t believe I&#039;ve been reported before, this is my first experience with people like these it&#039;s insane","replies":[{"poster":"Narwhal","date":"2016-03-28T08:13:44.243+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't feel too bad, I once had all 4 of my team (a premade before clubs) go afk except one who stayed to make sure they all came back at the end and not get reported, it was a good 1v5 game.
