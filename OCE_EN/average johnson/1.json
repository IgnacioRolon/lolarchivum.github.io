Other players can get the corresponding profits, but we can&#039;t, we don&#039;t have items that can be used for discounts. So this activity is zero profit for us. It is not necessary at all. In other words, our interests rights are even less than normal account players. \r\nThis happened for a long time, and i think is time to ask some feedback from you guys now. \r\nSo what is some others reward for full skins account at this point? greedy me , i have to collect more limited skins as more as i can. Sorry Riot, i have to make this statement to squeeze my last few benefits. \r\nBig hope for you guys can send me some limited items. Thank you Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-03-10T04:58:23.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel for the few big spenders, the shop event should have granted emotes, chromas, or simply a large chunk of BE. Riot needs to respect the people that think, you know what, instead of having a car or buying a new computer or paying rent are like; 'ooh new skins, I have to have every single one'.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-03-10T04:17:58.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Average Johnson","date":"2018-03-10T01:38:46.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot pls","replies":[]}]}
