Season 5 i was Gold 3, Season 6 i finished my promos in Silver 2 and lost interest in league for a little while, while i was busy with life stuff. I have skype, choof bills, enjoy mad bants, don&#039;t ever rage and enjoy learning the game and developing mechanical skill.\r\n\r\nPreferably someone who has carried themselves to gold playing adc, but beggers can&#039;t be choosers so if you&#039;re a mad dawg and know where/when to right click some stuff i&#039;d like to get you fed af. Braum and Janna, are my go-to supports but i have a pretty good feel for all of them. \r\n\r\ni can keep u alive\r\ni can help u secure ur kills\r\ni can b ur dad","replies":[{"poster":"x Peppa Pig x","date":"2016-11-24T20:26:00.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"xpeppa pigx","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Brain Ahzoos","date":"2016-11-24T00:52:50.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im willing to play with ya but im only bronze 3.
