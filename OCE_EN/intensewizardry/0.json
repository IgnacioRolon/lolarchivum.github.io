She does a lot of different things *good*, but is exceptional at nothing.\n\nUnlike most other assassins, she has very little mobility and lacks a ‘get out of jail free’ card. Once she is in the fight, much like Irelia and Xin Zhao, she has to stay there. In my mind, she is nothing more than an initiator that is made to get in the fight and then keep fighting. However, she has no sustain or mitigation. She is in an awful place design wise.\n\nIf we compare her to other assassins.\n\n**Talon**: Can hop walls with very little delay. He also has an ult that provides stealth.\n\n**Akali**: Can shroud and play around in it. She can also use her ult to escape.\n\n**Zed**: Can dash away with shadows. He can also use his ult as an escape if done right.\n\nAnother issue with Qiyana is that some of her kit is clunky. Her kit looks like it has been tweaked to be as new player friendly as possible. When using her stealth, there is this delay before you can auto attack. The delay is perfectly aligned to proc Duskblade^. Also, her E > Q often misses. There has been many times when it has straight up missed the enemy, despite them standing still.\n\n^Apparently this has been noticed by Riot and they are working on it(?)\n\nAnother concern is that her ultimate requires the right conditions. It is a super strong ultimate, but it does not work like every other assassins ultimate. I wish it did more when in the river and in brush. It seems like you should really only throw it out at walls.\n\nQiyana is pretty mediocre and seems to fall off harder than other assassins if she falls behind. People have taken to calling her Akali 2.0. In my opinion, I do wish her elements played a bigger role. Also, her W is a completely useless skill besides grabbing different elements. Speaking of elements:\n\n**Rock**: Pretty much all you want to use.\n\n**Grass**: Useless and too easily telegraphed.\n\n**Water**: Useful to engage with for a free E > Q > W (rock) > Q > R combo.\n\nAs for people saying that she is bad… that is pretty common after a new champ releases. I would seek out the Qiyana Mains subreddit for more advice.","replies":[{"poster":"ShinySylveonGX","date":"2019-09-08T21:06:27.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This really helped me decide whether i should get her or not so thanks!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Poppin Off Poppy","date":"2019-07-15T19:06:39.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently shes got the lowest win rate in league, looks like she may even beat {{champion:134}}  for the spot of \"worst at release\" as she sits at a 40% win rate mid and around 43% top and jungle.
