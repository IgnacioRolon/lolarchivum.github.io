Ty riot\n\nRito Fix system plz... Very munted.\n\nWhy isnt blitz banned.... because i guess it just simply doesn&#039;t work that way....\n\nEDIT: let me add this one to convince you as well https://gyazo.com/0ace200e27c783ec64dcff8fc289a9d5\nEDIT #2: All these games are recent, VERY RECENT. Not sure why but this is meant to be a team game and OCE region and in this photo my mid/top DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH. https://gyazo.com/b0cb60690f56fb6d54a678b94ba8e34b","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-06-08T05:31:23.678+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nYou didn't post any chat logs so we can't really go into the specifics of why you received your punishment, but I would like to just correct a few of the things you said.\n\n+ **Getting angry at trolls is absolutely fine, harassing and flaming them is not. **\n\n I understand it's very tempting sometimes, but if you choose to flame, then you become just as bad as the trolls and will be punished under the same rules. \n\n Even if they are guilty, by flaming you become part of the problem. Not to mention many trolls are looking for exactly that kind of response.\n\n+ **Speaking a different language is not reportable.**\n\n **Riot** specifically outlines this [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player#h2q4). I personally don't mind other languages, but if you do find them irritating simply mute and move on. \n\n You can't understand what they're saying anyway, so there's really no difference. You'll be able to communicate most of the important information through the smart ping system.\n\n Remember, the OCE server supports [7 different countries](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/oceanic-transfer-faq) with a few recently added ones, who have a total of 7 different official languages. \n\n+ **_\"Why isn't blitz banned...\"_**\n\n If you reported him, then the instant feedback system would have reviewed his case. The punishment he received depends on how serious the offence was. \n \nI'd advise you to be more careful in the future as your next offence will result in a [14 day ban](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-#h1q2). It would be a shame to get banned over something this trivial.\n\nIf you need any help with anything, feel free to ask ;)","replies":[{"poster":"RememberMeKid","date":"2016-06-08T12:29:13.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont worry about the chat logs..... who cares. It's the fact that my team mates continually feed over and over from time to time, Now im not sure if riot as completely ruined the ranking system with dynamic queue... People aernt even in their own elo's.... and 80% of the teams im on have lower ranks than the other team. Its like im forced to constantly carry my team to succeed in ranking higher, TRAILER: \"team game\" yeah ok..... Either we need to fix the mmr system or dynamic queue and add a Solo queue which was brought up and shoved under the rug for some god awful reason.\n\nIf your team feed and my scores are as they are.... Give me a way to 1v5 and i guarantee that i've tried it.\n\nWhat ever you do.... do not say \"forget about that game\".... i only have a span of 3-4 hours a day to play league because of studies so pretty much most games are crucial when considering time.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-06-09T06:11:19.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks for the reply.\n\nJust before I start; people have been complaining about feeding team-mates since long before Dynamic Queue was even a thing. This is not new and I strongly doubt your issue had anything to do with Dynamic Queue.\n\n> One key point I want to discuss though, is that you're using rank to determine someone's elo. This is generally a bad idea as [rank isn't used in matchmaking](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ#h3q2) at all, and is sometimes poorly representative of a players MMR.\n \n> + As a matter of fact, in the game you mentioned with the feeding **Blitzcrank**, your team had an average rank of **Gold 4** whereas the enemies average rank was **Silver 1**. \n\n>  _Your average rank was higher, yet you say that this game was unfair for your team?_ \n\n>  As you can see yourself, their rank was actually not a very accurate indication of their skill.\n__*\n\n+ I think the main issue is you just have a small misconception about how ranked works.\n\n You don't have to always _\"carry my team to succeed in ranking higher\"_ or constantly find a new _\"way to 1v5\"_. In fact, the champions you're playing currently are actually not ideal for solo carrying (**Fiddlesticks**, **Amumu**, **Shen**... etc.).\n\n _**There's more than one way to climb in ranked.**_ Sure solo carrying is one of them, but it's definitely not the only way. Some players like to focus on supporting team-mates and facilitate their snowball. Others like to play an objective based game where they shotcall for the team.\n\nIf you're struggling to climb, it might be time to put strong emphasis on gameplay analysis and change a few things up. A coach could help in these situations, otherwise we have some great instructors here on the forums who might be able to lend a hand.\n\nI hope this helped!","replies":[{"poster":"RememberMeKid","date":"2016-06-10T11:18:33.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://gyazo.com/84f213077b542b00e3d4cd142482da06 yup ill change up a few things for sure. I'm not missing the point at all. The fact is that people like these have the same mmr as me. Thats whats wrong with the ranking system.
