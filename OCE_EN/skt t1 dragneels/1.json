Also performance in a single game is more likely player based rather than based on the champion pick. I've played troll picks like Leona top, Lucian jungle, midlane Zilean, Adc Ziggs and support Ammumu to fair success in the past.\n\nEzreal was once a midlaner, an adc and a jungler. Nautilus has historically been a toplaner, jungler and a support. Jarvan has been a meta pick toplane, midlane, jungle and support depending on which patch it was. Veigar has been a midlaner, toplaner, support and an APC in botlane. \n\nPre-rework Kayle throughout her previous life, had managed to be a meta pick in every single role in the game at one point (top,mid,jg,adc,sup), and which roles she was viable in was highly volatile depending on patch or even how the meta developed within a single patch at times.\n\nAnd even recently, I picked Lucian jungle because our botlane was a crit lee sin and a support without a support item singed. We still lost that game when the singed dcd and the leesin started spamming surrender votes, but I did very well personally with my %hp shred lifesteal bruiser lucian build, all things (like a botlane that went 3-22 during laning phase) considered.\n\nAnd you think you can neatly pigeonhole every single champion?","replies":[]},{"poster":"SquidbrickS","date":"2019-03-30T08:16:43.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely feel as though there would be no point in having the 150+ champion roster if they were to do this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"El Gringos","date":"2019-03-28T22:13:03.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can have toplaners who get stomped, it comes down to the individual, sadly you cant only lock characters into certain positions","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-03-29T09:07:45.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ok, but how do you think those 'viable in other roles' champions become viable?\n\nBy the same logic we could argue that only FotM picks should be allowed, since there is a point to be made that any other pick isn't trying as hard as you can to win, but that has glaring flaws too. A Malzahar main is going to be better on off-meta Malzahar than in-meta [insert champion] that they don't play, so denying them that choice ultimately hurts you.\n\nShould someone who plays Sylas top with consideration made to the enemy and allied team-comps, and who has success with it, be denied that choice just because it's not meta?\n\nWould you not prefer the mid-main to be allowed to play their best champ in support, rather than a support champ they've never played before just because it's not meta, and in spite of the fact that the majority of mids can function just fine in support with enough champ knowledge?\n\nIf you're playing in-meta Sion top in ranked, having never played the champion before in your life, are you not a way bigger troll than the Lulu main taking it top who is flexing because of an enemy pick or an autofill?","replies":[]}]}
