I would like to know if this can get revoked as I feel it&#039;s very unfair!!\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nCaspeer: Report teemo\r\nCaspeer: Troll pick\r\nCaspeer: I am calm lol?\r\nCaspeer: Doesn&#039;t mean troll pick support\r\nCaspeer: Teemo so bad, muted and reported\r\nCaspeer: afk\r\nCaspeer: kill teemo idc\r\nCaspeer: report teemo\r\nCaspeer: stealking cs\r\nCaspeer: He is so bad\r\nCaspeer: kill tememo\r\nCaspeer: kill teemo you noobs\r\nCaspeer: stop it\r\nCaspeer: dont come to lane\r\nCaspeer: fuck off\r\nCaspeer: afk\r\nCaspeer: He is shoving lane\r\nCaspeer: taking cs\r\nCaspeer: on purpose\r\nCaspeer: not kiting\r\nCaspeer: im afk\r\n\r\n^- I can understand why I got reported, due to saying I would afk so many times, although I never did! But I don&#039;t understand why I got banned, I swore once, but when you have a teemo support, who uses his blind to steal cs and lets the enemy run past him to kill me, what can you expect? And plus, isn&#039;t that what the chat filter is for?\r\n\r\nGame 2\r\nCaspeer: fuck sorry malph\r\nCaspeer: my bad\r\nCaspeer: stop attacking the minions ffs\r\nCaspeer: im so fucking pissed off i asked you to stop attacking the minions ages ago, ive missed so much cs because i can&#039;t calc the dmg\r\nCaspeer: and you ignore me\r\nCaspeer: I don&#039;t care, not a single gank, soraka keeps ignoring me fucking up my cs\r\nCaspeer: You can talk quinn, enjoy chat ban when i report you\r\nCaspeer: Talking trash in all chat\r\nCaspeer: Reported for giving up and flaming quinn, enjoy chat ban\r\n\r\n^- How is any of this justifiable for a 2 week ban??? I asked soraka to stop taking cs, she ignored me, asked her again because it was making it hard for me to cs properly, then the top laner starts flaming me in all chat, towards the enemy team, yet none of that chat log is showed! \r\n\r\nCan someone please explain to me how either of these chat logs is a reason for a 2 week ban? Especially since I was given the ban one game after I finished my chat ban! How is that a fair amount of time to fix my behaviour (Although tbh my behaviour in both of these games is nothing compared to how the other players on my team acted.\r\n\r\nWhy do riot employees view game chat logs like this? Reading one side at a time is very unfair, If I was able to post the other players chat log I&#039;m sure I would get unbanned instantly.\r\n\r\nI may just be complaining/annoyed that I got banned, and I&#039;m not saying I don&#039;t deserve it, but at the same time I think there should be a better reason then these 2 chat logs!!\r\n\r\nFeel free to put me in my place if you think these chat logs are worthy of a 2 week ban!\r\n\r\nSomeone from Riot please respond and explain to me how this is justifiable!!","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-08-12T08:38:09.430+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Enjoy ban :)","replies":[{"poster":"Caspeer","date":"2017-08-12T08:44:16.956+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submitted a ticket and it got removed!!

You don't have to take it, but it may help:\n\n* No need to repeat the same protestation about people stealing CS. They either will or they won't. If they're hitting minions to \"help\" see it as a challenge for you to improve your CS'ing ability, since you _can_ control the timing of _your_ autos/abilities but not of your teammates.\n\n* If it bothers you just danger ping once or type \"stop it\" in chat. They'll either stop or they won't. It's incredibly rare for players to stop if you keep asking them too, so save your energy.\n\n* For good measure mute the player and their pings, no need to get tilted by them gloating in chat or pinging each minion you miss.\n\n* Keep things out of all chat. There's no reason to let the other side know you're frustrated because they'll more than likely take full advantage of your frustration with ganks, trolling, laughing etc.\n\n* Ask your jungler for a gank, ask your teammate for help or a lane swap, try to take an objective (dragon, tower, invade etc.) or something that will take the focus away from the CS'ing issue and can actually benefit yourself and your team\n\n* Stay cool. If all else fails, mute all and farm until the game ends. You may not win, but your skills will be honed for next game.\n\nHope that helps and good luck in future games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RazorScythe188","date":"2017-08-16T11:38:06.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You got paired up with trolls so it isn't your fault, just control your temper and avoid  swearing. Trolls want you to get angry, and you're giving them that, just give them a 'sigh' and they might stop trolling. It's what I do and it works all the time, for me.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
