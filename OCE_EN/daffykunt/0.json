I don&#039;t knot how they changed it as there is no left over RP in my account which there would have been if they purchased RP to change my name (as the 1300 RP it costs to change summoner name is not an exact amount purchasable on the shop) and I had nowhere near enough to change it through IP pls help. is it possibe to change it back without paying? am I the only one this happened to?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-01T08:15:19.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Read over [this page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751694).

It's possible, but they are miles apart in terms of difficulty. Also, if you hacked into a server, why would you only mess up one guy's account? And in such a weird way, too.\n\nThe terminology \"hi-jacked account\" basically means that someone other than you, and whom you have not authorised, has access to your account. Most people who get access to another person's account without their permission will usually change the password (because they have the e-mail as well, in most cases). Just because you still have access to your own account, it still falls under this category.\n\nUltimately, you'll need to submit a support ticket in order to get what you want. They will instruct you on what you need to provide.\n\nBe sure to change the password for every account you have access to on your computer, not just League.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
