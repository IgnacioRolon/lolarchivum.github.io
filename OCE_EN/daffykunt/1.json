First bug I&#039;ve encountered is I wasn&#039;t able to view the end of game screen obviously this has only happened once since I&#039;ve only played one game but from other posts it sounds like it happens to a lot of people. Second bug was that after trying to play another game after the first when I got in champ select all I could see was the splash art for the champ I played last (darius) there was no champions, summoners or masteries to click so I just had to wait till it timed me out and I took the penalty. I then restarted the client once the timeout finished and went into another game and got into champ select. one i clicked a champ to pick it just loaded for ages till I was again timed out of the game. This has happened all 6 other times I&#039;ve tried this. Also in the one game I played my fps was about 30 lower than it usually is. WTF have you done riot can I change back to the beta? I literally cant even play on this s***","replies":[]}
