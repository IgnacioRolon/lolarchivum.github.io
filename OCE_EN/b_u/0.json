Which is fantastic *applause* however due to the small player base of the OCE server autofill is enabled. I am a simple Gold 5 player that wishes to play to the best of my ability. I find it awesome that soloq is back yet I feel that having autofill in it slightly contradicts the purpose of soloq (especially with the system of being able to choose 2 positions and it being in lower ranks). \r\n\r\nNow I understand that if one is truly &quot;skilled&quot; one can climb regardless of position. However, I do not solely play to climb, I play to have fun and for myself playing a position that I did not choose limits both my ability to climb (since I am not that skilled) and my capacity to have &quot;fun&quot;. I&#039;m not saying that other roles are less fun objectively, this is a subjective matter that differs from individual to individual. \r\n\r\nWhat I wish ultimately and simply is for autofill to go away. I definitely see the need for it and agree it is a decent solution, and a great one in the elite echelons of soloq (master/challenger). I understand further that autofill probably will not simply vanish due to the implications (longer wait time, lesser quality in matches). I am sure this sort of conversation has occurred in Riot and the decision to input autofill not easily made. Yet I would like to know in greater depth the reasons why it was made and the reasoning behind it. Additionally if any Rioter&#039;s are reading this and possess shareable knowledge; are you working on a longer term &#039;solution&#039;? \r\n\r\nCordially,\r\nB u","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-11-21T01:11:14.752+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"We have autofill for the reasons you said (reduce queue times and protect quality of matches). I do understand it sucks when you are autofilled though. \n\nOne way we can fix this issue is to make the less played roles more appealing. you can check out some of our thoughts around this here - http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/free-rotation/some-thoughts-support","replies":[{"poster":"Buttsubushi","date":"2016-12-19T18:17:38.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One month later, I can say that I'm sick of getting supports who both **DON'T WANT TO** and **CAN'T** play support. It is making playing ADC a headache, and I rather wait the extra time, even 10-15 mins during offpeak times to get someone who actually wants to play the role.\n\nI don't care if I get autofilled myself, if noone wants to trade I just lock in support Yasuo and just wait for someone to dodge. And if they don't:\n{{champion:157}}__{{summoner:3}} {{summoner:4}}_ _{{item:3050}} {{item:3107}} {{item:2045}} {{item:3022}} {{item:3190}} {{item:3111}}\n\nIf some gets autofilled, that means that everyone else has got the role they want and will be less inclined to swap since, they most likely got their role because they have autofill protection and don't want to waste it.\n\nRanked is no longer based on pick order for the roles, meaning that autofill is the new last pick. But back then the last 2-3 picks could swap the roles around as they like since most likely all of them didn't get the role they wanted and are more willing to compremise to get the best players on the remaining roles. Now days 4 people get the role they want, and no one wants to swap anymore with the support.\n\nI can play support, in fact I can play every role, but I don't want to pick fill and every game have to support. **If I picked fill and it gave me any of the other roles, the same one 80% of the time, even my main ADC, I would stop filling.** I prefer to have a more even spread across the roles then getting the same role over and over if I pick fill. And that is a problem for both fill and autofill. getting the one role over and over. I haven't heard anyone complain about getting autofilled jungle or top yet, but I have twice got top from just filling back in dynamic queue.\n\nIf you could just remove autofill for lower elos again, more people might take up support in **their own time** to, you know, **learn the role.** Back with the older dynamic queue we could play the same 2 roles over and over to master a small selection of champs, and climb. Now everyone who wants to seriously climb has to either:\n1. main support\n2. put support as their secondary and get support 90% of the time anyway.\n3. Get autofilled 50% of the time they don't have autofill protection and essentially have to play 3 roles.\n\nI'd like to say though, keep up with making other incentives to play fill or support. Where you put extra champs on free rotation that were supports/off-meta supports was a good idea. (Others I've come up with: 50% Ip boost, one guaranteed key frag for winning a filled game each day, IP discount on champs/rune pages)\n\n_I'm only replying to this old tread since it is the only Red post reply to the topic of autofill and all others seem to be ignored.

This year it seems to be more like 70%, with the missing 20% going to ADC. Possibly this is because more people are hating the adc role with autofill supports. I no longer queue as \"Fill\" because the reason I play or even learnt the support role was to avoid bad players in this role. Also because after watching the Season 4 World Championship, I was inspired by Mata's play. He had the most likeable playstyle out of the other pro players, for me. For now I put in \"Support-Mid\" to get support.\n\nAutofill was introduced to reduce queue times (especially in lower population servers). It's a pity that this has shown up OCE's greatest weakness - most of the server don't know how to support (this also translates to that most of the server don't know how the game works). And now that they need to learn the role to survive, albeit for one game at a time, we are seeing more threads like this.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Buttsubushi,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=F6a4bMs5,comment-id=00030002,timestamp=2016-12-19T18:17:38.226+0000)\n>\n> One month later, I can say that I&#x27;m sick of getting supports who both **DON&#x27;T WANT TO** and **CAN&#x27;T** play support.

It can say \"I'm prepared to wait for however long it takes to get one of my assigned roles, and I agree not to complain about waiting times. Tick this box to confirm.\"\n\nThere are simple solutions to the games problems. Until Riot figures them out, you'll have to figure out how to cope with the current situation.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-11-21T03:14:17.017+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Id scratch off quality of matches if i were you.\n\nI guarantee the lower in elo you go the more negatively autofill affects match quality due to overall game knowledge going down and the chances of a player not being competent in their autofilled roll going up.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-11-21T05:15:17.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean in low elo you can't blame auto fill for quality of matches, some people really are just bad, those players being auto-filled is just an excuse.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-11-21T06:53:22.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True but still, its like they get exponentially worse when it happens.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"B u","date":"2016-12-10T13:26:45.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, actually creating an incentive to play other roles is an excellent idea. As season 7 has come upon us all (whether for good or for worse) I have realized that I actually try and fill more, for that way I can guarantee a few games where I am not autofilled. I think that autofill shield has indirectly impacted my decision to deliberately fill for it is possible to obtain another role other than ones I find less appealing thereby if I do obtain such a position my mindset is already \"I chose this\" and not \"This ludicrous\".
