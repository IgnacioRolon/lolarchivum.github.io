The problem is i can log in to league and look for a game but (i assume) whenever i find a game (accept/decline doesn&#039;t pop up) it comes up with connection error then constantly just says retrieving data from server. i tried a custom match against bots and i was in champ select but when the timer hit 0 it just sat there in champ select going no where which is why i assume the error only pops up when the accept/decline option comes up due to it being random (10 second or 2 minutes into looking for match). any one else have/had this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Haxed","date":"2016-03-05T12:03:40.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump. would really like some help? considering i did the fucking recommended fixes and now my client won't fucking update.","replies":[]}]}
