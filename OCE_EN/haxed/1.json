It just happens to be that it's more noticeable in ranked than in the YouTube comments.\n\nI'd like to know though, why do you think **Riot** _created_ toxicity in League? Knowing that would be far more valuable and we might even be able to correct it going forwards.","replies":[{"poster":"Haxed","date":"2016-09-23T22:44:10.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im not saying riot created toxicity from day one..  i'm saying they're creating toxic players recently, when someone gets chat banned generally they either do 1 of 3 things.. continue to play and actually get something good done in their games due to their inability to dribble shit.. rage and stop playing for a bit so they cool off doing something else.. or climb into the next game and feed because \"hurhur dhuhurhur i got chat banned fuck riot\"\n\nThese days they do one of two things.. climb into their game and either feed or give up instantly when something goes wrong because their incentive to do well is gone (rewards such as chests and key fragments) or quit. It's almost as if riot is antagonizing people. \n\nfirst problem is that the system that decides whether or not you get banned is automated, so i can say fuck and it assumes that the context that the word is used in is negative. the word fuck should not be a word that could be used against you. there is a language filter, if you decide to turn the filter off then report people because the word fuck offends you then i should be able to go play in traffic and sue someone for a hit n run, it's fucking stupid. \n\nsecond problem is that not only do you get banned from the automated system but it then takes away you ablity to get rewards like they key fragments and chests.. these rewards are given to you through your ability to play the game well and win, not your ability to suck your teams dick, now if your chance to receive a fragment improved based off how many honors you got once you left post-game lobby then it would make sense.\n\nthird problem is that AFTER your chat ban that an automated system gave you it is then up to this useless fucking community to honor you (which are hard to receive without asking/begging)  so that you can receive rewards again. \n\nI think that creates toxic players. i'm not rewarded for being the most positive player on my team nor have i been punished for being extremely toxic like i was 2 games ago to some dense fucking garen. now if i was banned for 4 days after that game i wouldn't complain. i'd think it was too harsh but at least the problem was viewed and somebody said \"you deserve this punishment i am giving you\". even manual chat bans where someone has been reported so much that a rioter has to get involved can't be argued against and you see it all the time in forums, somebody complains and says they didn't do anything and someone posts their chat log and an apology and an excuse comes up. \n\nThe simplest way i can say it is it went from taking away peoples ability to flame to taking away peoples incentive to play the game properly. They no longer get rewarded for doing well so they just fuck everyone around until riot goes \"hrhuruhr well fuck you got chat banned and now you're being banned for 14 days how can you say you don't deserve it\" when in reality they're just losing their shit because some kid who called him a %%%got for 40 minutes and fed on purpose reported him and the automated system fucking mutes him and 9 other kids like the first one refuse to honor him even though his behavior has gotten better so he can't receive rewards after his chat bans up so he fucking quits because the automated system doesn't have the ability to gauge someones fucking behavior or personality.\n\nI've been working all night while also dealing with trash and i'll be surprised if i don't get banned for a while after some of the games i've had so i'm salty as fuck so with that in mind if anything i said makes no sense i'll elaborate if you actually care enough about my opinion/observations","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-09-24T00:27:43.076+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Long response incoming! Hopefully it makes sense though ;)\n\n__*\n\n> These days they do one of two things.. climb into their game and either feed or give up instantly when something goes wrong because their incentive to do well is gone\n\n+ The incentive is now to reform so you get rewards back. There are many players who don't care they are chat restricted, but when they start to loose out on skins they'll put some effort in to fix their behaviour.\n\n The incentive to play well might be diminished, but I don't think it's gone by any stretch of the imagination. Before Hextech Crafting was introduced, people still wanted to do well and win. I don't see why that might have changed.\n\n> first problem is that the system that decides whether or not you get banned is automated, so i can say fuck and it assumes that the context that the word is used in is negative.\n\n+ Nope not at all. Non-derogatory swearing is perfectly fine [according to **Riot**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player#h2q2). In fact, if I remember correctly, some of the phrases the system found to be linked to positivity were \"well shit\", \"shit sorry\" and \"fuck me\".\n\n> there is a language filter, if you decide to turn the filter off then report people because the word fuck offends you then i should be able to go play in traffic and sue someone for a hit n run, it's fucking stupid.\n\n+ The language filter or the mute button isn't there to allow for toxic behaviour. Those systems are there to protect players during a game.\n\n If **Riot** just adopt the mentality of _\"just mute them and turn on the filter\"_. They're basically saying _\"this behaviour is fine, if you take offence then you can just mute them\"_, which would **actually be allowing for more toxicity in the community.**\n\n I have a really great video on this if you want know more.\n\n> these rewards are given to you through your ability to play the game well and win, not your ability to suck your teams dick\n\n+ True, it might seem like **Riot** is taking away something unrelated. But like I said, this is there to try and give more incentive for reform. There's also something to be said that \"playing well\" includes a bit of sportsmanship too.\n\n> third problem is that AFTER your chat ban that an automated system gave you it is then up to this useless fucking community to honor you (which are hard to receive without asking/begging) so that you can receive rewards again.\n\n+ Who told you this? If it's an official source I'd definitely like to see it.\n\n The support site on [Hextech Crafting restrictions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209939463-Hextech-Crafting-Restrictions), only mentions you need good behaviour. It never mentions honours even once.\n\n> I think that creates toxic players. i'm not rewarded for being the most positive player on my team...\n\n+ We're in agreement there for sure. The honour system is lame and not really rewarding. Luckily **Riot**'s got a rework planned for sometime in the future :)\n\n> ...nor have i been punished for being extremely toxic like i was 2 games ago to some dense fucking garen\n\n+ There's a few reasons as to why you might not have been banned. And yes, one of them is that the Instant Feedback system didn't work properly in this case. Although it's unlikely that happened IMO.\n\n Other reasons are that; no one reported you (I often forget to report sometimes too), or this was your first offence in a while and system didn't get too harsh. \n\n I guarantee though, if you keep this up with any good frequency you'll be facing punishment.\n\n> if anything i said makes no sense i'll elaborate if you actually care enough about my opinion/observations\n\n+ I think I got the general idea of everything, let me know if I'm not understanding though!\n\n Your views and opinions aren't unjustified, toxicity in this game really isn't at an acceptable level yet (and I don't know if it ever can be). **Riot**'s approach and dealing with toxicity is also questionable at times (_cough*_ dynamic queue). I don't think some of the points you brought up in this case were really fair.\n\nI hope I answered a few of your complaints.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-09-23T22:23:58.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"people are always going to be toxic in anygame, but riots bad approach to everything hasn't exactly helped. ever since dynamic que came out and lvl 30 has become easier to get, everyone of my ranked game have been like 20x more toxic. they focus far to much on raking the money in, rather than listening to its playerbase and making the game better.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-09-23T23:20:39.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, the move to Dynamic Queue was actually made primarily because they thought it would reduce toxicity.

But yeah the LP and Rank didn't mean anything to them, just kills. But with that said yo udon't even have to be toxic to be reported by some salty kid and the system will find something to ban you for. It would be decent if it gave you more than just the last games chat log as evidence, if it gave you the previous 3 games it would alleviate so much hostility towards the automated system because people would see that it not only \"scanned\" your last game but your previous lot that you had been reported in and it has now given you enough proof.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2016-09-23T21:23:46.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think in any competitive esport or online game, there will be plenty of toxic people. This generally doesn't happen in normal sports because the competitors are not only face-to-face in the real world, but there are also plenty of spectators watching their every move. But in online, certain players think they can hide behind a computer screen and just behave in whatever way they choose.\nRecently on a twitch stream I've had people say to me that the chess community is even more toxic. For example, have a look at the chess.com forums - they look remarkably similar to whats on here! I hadn't noticed it before because in chess, you are the only person responsible for your actions on the battlefield and in general, higher skilled players are not toxic because they don't have time to waste on such behaviour. They don't want to waste effort into being toxic just for the sake of covering up their unskilled plays. They would rather just focus on the game and improving.\nSo, no, I disagree that Riot is to blame.","replies":[{"poster":"Haxed","date":"2016-09-23T22:51:46.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm blaming riot for implementing a system that is more of an irritation than a solution. Imagine having something that can't fairly judge or critic your behavior take away your ability to talk or receive rewards due to what other players have reported (whether just or unjust)  and then relying on the same community who could've gotten you banned for saying \"gg ez\" to give you back the ability to earn rewards that you earn through doing well at the game rather than being a good community member. I could say \"Fuck it's cold outside\" in 8 games straight, absolutely demolish my opponents, get reported for verbal abuse and because the word fuck is in there i get chat banned and denied loot. I used to have all honor ribbons and ever since transferring to OCE i've lost them and never regained them, not saying i SHOULD have them. I have been banned in the past so fairs fair, i lost something that i gained from the community because the community had reported me for being toxic. Same with chat bans, fairs fair. you talk shit you lose the ability to talk shit. But when you get banned for nothing and then have something completely irrelevant to matter at hand taken away from you and put into other players hands to give back to you then you lose faith, start to hate the game more and more before eventually quitting or becoming toxic yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2016-09-25T03:23:49.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well according to Tele, that's not true:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Tele,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=qgO2hFqs,comment-id=000100010000,timestamp=2016-09-24T00:27:43.076+0000)\n>\n> + Nope not at all.
