However, when you get a troll, all you have to do is hard carry. Just like the last I had, heimer was trolling and refused to listen. Since we had a nasus, I went to his lane and made his laner low so he gets the last hit, I also made sure I was drawing pressure towards my lane so that jungler, bot lane/top lane was forced to go to my lane to defend and giving my laners more time to farm and take more objectives. Since we got the nasus fed, we grouped mid to draw pressure while nasus split top and eventually we won the game with a TROLL.
