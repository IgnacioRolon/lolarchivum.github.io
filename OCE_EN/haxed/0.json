Riot&#039;s as useless as it&#039;s fucking %%%% of a community. HE EVEN ADDED ME AFTER THE GAME! ANYONE WANNA GUESS WHY? TAKE A WILD FUCKING GUESS? \r\n\r\nOn top of  that i also lost a promo game because even though i had locked in a champion and was in skin select (which you can&#039;t get to without LOCKING IN THE CHAMPION) i got kicked for failing to lock in, GG.\r\n\r\nNo i wasn&#039;t being toxic in game either, am now doe","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-09-21T08:58:49.969+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"its not just 1 game and you get banned friend. So although you may have been falsely reported, according to you, it would have also been added to the cumulative reports sent prior to that game that all led up to the chat ban.\n\nYou dont get banned from just reports either, reports are just flags to the system to say \"hey, check out this guy\". The reports go into a system that then checks your chat logs and determines if you need a ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Haxed","date":"2016-09-21T11:02:39.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All i've done is fill in ranked, go support and say \"Dw about it man\" or \"gj man keep it up\"","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-09-21T12:20:38.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolute bullshit right here. \nAs if anyone on the league boards is ever going to believe that dude. \nEspecially after you've been chat banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Haxed","date":"2016-09-22T06:48:09.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't leave my whole chat log here so i'll leave a screencap of the ONLY thing i can see that would warrant a chat ban, http://prntscr.com/ckwx9f\n\nLegit only thing there is the comment to udyr... BECAUSE HE WAS INTENTIONALLY FEEDING, to which i have proof. i can tell you in detail what every single comment in that screencap is for, as you can see i try to be encouraging to the people who at 4 minutes in said \"gg im afk\" which eventually got them to keep playing.. which caused them to flame even more. i even asked in champ select who they would like my ban to be.. i got ignored.. but sol flamed me for my pick which is why i said get over it kiddo and shit. from 4 minutes in they just flamed sol, then udyr blamed my promos for his feeding saying he was doing it on purpose which made the rest blame me for the loss.. if you can somehow defend them for blaming me for udyr feeding because he wanted me to lose promos then fuck me apply to be a rioter, can't fail.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2016-09-21T11:11:57.239+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hahah Riots automated system at it again. Not surprised in the least. It really is a pathetic system and really only works for chat bans and afk players. Take Tyler 1 for example, probably THE biggest toxic person to ever play League yet look how long he was able to play before Riot started to do something about it. Even then he still plays today ruining peoples games like he always did, he just doesn't stream it because that account would get banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Haxed","date":"2016-09-21T11:24:33.074+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tyler1 plays a bit on stream now and even uploads vids, but the most toxic shit i have said n the last week would probably be \"fuck up and get over it\" and thats not enough to warrant a chat ban, i haven't been toxic at all, i want tribunal because even if i was toxic the person who is actually flaming would cop it as well","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xDarkRavenx","date":"2016-09-21T13:03:20.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh hey I played with you.","replies":[{"poster":"Haxed","date":"2016-09-22T06:43:08.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmm?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-09-21T08:29:19.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You wouldn't have got chat banned unless you were being toxic","replies":[{"poster":"Haxed","date":"2016-09-21T08:34:57.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering the only 2 \"toxic\" things i said were \"don't get salty because i wrecked you 1v1\" and \"go get mum to buy you boost to gold like last season\" to two seperate people i find it hard to believe, you can get banned for fucking saying easy in this game, wouldn't be surprised if people have been banned because riots automated piece of shit took the word \"easy\" out of context.\n\nBut no unless you consider them two sentences bannable compared to their constant abuse then i shouldn't have been chat banned\n\nNot chat banned, behaviour ban, so i can't even get crates and keys anymore because some guy decided to troll my promos then report me or some guy got so mad that he lost his perfect kda to me he reported me.
