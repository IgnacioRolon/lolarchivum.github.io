Light Chords grant 100 max health to allies while near her and increase their movement speed towards Araya. Enemy champions do reduced damage. Also, every 4th ability cast by Araya stuns them for 0.5 seconds.\r\nQ, Ride the Light: Araya can dash to an enemy or allied champion connected by a Light Chord. This grants her a shield, lasting 3 seconds, that negates the next crowd control ability cast by an enemy champion and does (50/75/100/150/200) physical damage to enemies within a small radius.\r\nW, Reel: Araya tugs on an enemy&rsquo;s Light Chord, turning it red, then pulling them towards her after 1 second, dealing (100/125/150/200/250) magic damage. The enemy cannot be targeted during this ability.\r\nE, Draining Shadows: Araya throws a ball of light, that targets enemies within radius. Enemies are slowed by 50% and take (20/25/30/35/40) damage per second. The ball lasts for 5 seconds.\r\nR/Ultimate, Vortex: Araya creates a vortex, pulling all nearby enemies inside, immobilizing and dealing 100 damage. After 2 seconds, Araya throws the enemies in all directions, dealing a further (100/150/200) damage.\r\nAraya was an Aspect of Targon, before she sided with humans and became banished from Mount Targon.\r\n\r\nZer&#039;g R&#039;ot, The Void Assimilate \r\nPassive, Absorb:\r\nZer&rsquo;g R&rsquo;ot gains Energy stacks for damage dealt to it by enemy champions. It gains 0.5 Magic Resist and Ability Power for every 100 magic damage dealt to it, and 0.5 Armour, along with 0.25 Attack Damage, for every 100 physical damage dealt to it. It also gains size from each stack.\r\nQ, Luring Prey:\r\nZer&rsquo;g R&rsquo;ot taunts target enemy champion for (1/1/1.5/1.5/2) seconds. It gains 10% movement speed (15% if heading towards targeted champion) until the end of the effect and any damage dealt by that champion during Luring Prey gains (1/1/2/2/2) bonus stacks of Energy.\r\nW, Weakening Bolts (3 Charges):\r\nZer&rsquo;g R&rsquo;ot shoots an energy ball, dealing (50/50/75/75/100) magic damage to the first target hit. It takes (10/10/15/15/20/20)% reduced damage from that target for 1 second.\r\nE, Power Smash:\r\nZer&rsquo;g R&rsquo;ot pounces forward. If it collides with an enemy champion it grabs them and slams them into the ground, dealing 150 physical damage and stunning for (0.5/0.5/0.5/1/1) seconds. Nearby enemies take 50 physical damage.\r\nR, Consume:\r\nZer&rsquo;g R&rsquo;ot pulls in all nearby enemies (max 5), suppressing them (excluding epic monsters, which it does (200/300/400) true damage to instead). It then does 200 magic damage to them over 3 seconds. It gains (15/20/25) max health for each enemy suppressed and can recast to throw them a short distance (can not throw over walls).\r\n\r\nThe Nameless &ndash; The Zaunite Assassin\r\nJungle/Mid/Assassin\r\nPassive, Killer&rsquo;s Memory:\r\nThe Nameless gains Lethality against an enemy every time they kill them. 0.2 per minion/monster, 2 per large monster, 4 per champion. \r\nQ, Assassin&rsquo;s Blade:\r\nThe Nameless channels for 2 seconds to sharpen his knife, gaining (5/10/15/20/25) lethality and (10/15/20/30/45) attack damage for the next 5 seconds. Their basic attacks also bleed the target for (20/20/40/40/60) physical damage over 2 seconds (does not stack).\r\nW, Into the Shadows:\r\nThe Nameless targets an enemy champion, blinding them for 3 seconds and dealing 50 magic damage. They can then recast to leap to them, refreshing the blindness and dealing (50/75/100/125/150) physical damage. \r\nE, Shadow Sweep:\r\nThe Nameless becomes surrounded by a large black field for 1 second. The size of the field increases by level. This field reveals wards, hidden traps, and invisible enemies for 5 seconds, additionally dealing 100 magic damage to enemies within the field but does not apply on hit effects. At level 3, the field can grant vision over barriers.\r\nR, A Murderer&rsquo;s Grasp:\r\nFor 5 seconds, The Nameless is given vision of the entire map (this vision isn&rsquo;t shared with allies). During this time, the Nameless can walk through minions and walls, becomes immune to cc (excluding knock-ups and suppressions), and their next attack deals a percentage of max health as Ultra True Damage*.\r\nUltra True Damage:\r\nDamage done as Ultra True Damage is not affected by armour, magic resist, damage reduction, tenancy (if damage is cc), and shields (both summoner spells and shields cast by champions). It will, on the other hand, remove any crowd control debuffs from the enemy attacked.\r\n\r\nMorana &ndash; The Lightsbane\r\nPassive, Banishing Symbol:\r\nMorana does 10% bonus damage against monsters. Every time Morana kills a monster, she gains stacks. 1 stack = 1 ap. 1 per small monster, 2 per medium monster, 5 per large monster, 15 per epic monster. This passive becomes Banishing Darkness after she gains a total of 80 ap from it. \r\nBanishing Darkness: Morana can expend her stacks temporarily to deal 100 + (25% Current ap) + (160) magic damage on her next attack (180 seconds cd). Activates when Morana double clicks an enemy champion. Lasts 5 seconds.\r\nQ, Hunter&rsquo;s Tread:\r\nWhen active, Morana regenerates (20/25/30/35/40) mana and (5/10/15/20/30) health per second for 10 seconds when in the jungle. She also gains (10/10/15/15/20) bonus movement speed. Taking damage from champions ends the effect. \r\nW, Light Seeker:\r\nMorana sends out (1/1/2/2/3) wisps of light that seek out nearby champions. Enemy champions are slowed, take 25% bonus damage from all sources, and are visible, but are granted vision of Morana&rsquo;s location for 3 seconds. Allied champions gain 15% increased movement speed, 40 armour, 40 magic resist, and they can recast one of their summoner spells (if it is on cd) for 3 seconds.\r\nE, Field of Strength:\r\nMorana creates a small area on the ground. After 1 second, it explodes, dealing magic damage based on enemies&rsquo; missing health. Morana can recast to dash to the lowest health enemy hit, dealing (75/100/125/175/225) physical damage.\r\nR, Energy Shower\r\nMorana picks a location. After 3 seconds, massive bolts of energy rain down from above in random locations within the circle. Each one deals 150 magic damage as an area of effect. Releases (5/7/10) meteors over 5 seconds.","replies":[]}
