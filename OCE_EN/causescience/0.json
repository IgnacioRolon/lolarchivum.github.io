The only way to get blue essence is to get tiny amounts out of capsules and chests. Disenchanting our own champion shards for a halfway decent amount isn&#039;t a very good method. With the old IP, we would get a bit every game, which i believe worked fine.\r\n* I understand that this makes the players buy RP for champions, therefore paying money, but we aren&#039;t happy with that. I have an entire list of champions i want to try but i cant cause i dont have the essence:{{champion:122}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:240}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:134}} And not forgetting the new champion Pyke{{champion:555}} , which i bought RP specifically to purchase him. Weekly rotations wont always show the champions we are want, and even if it does, we only have a week to play them.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, i think that Riot should (a) Decrease the blue essence cost of champions (b) implement a similar system as the private skin shop, but with champs, or (c) (optional) Add in a system that every week, we choose an un-owned champ, and for that week, we can play them for free, although this doesnt solve the problem entirely.\r\n\r\nFeel free to share your own ideas.\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"WandererYoshinon","date":"2018-06-26T12:08:21.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the new system is just a sneaky way to get people to play more. in the old system, you got a super consistent amount of ip per game (outside of first win bonus). the difference now is that you have to level up to get blue essence and if you play a lot, you'll earn it a LOT faster than you did before but if you don't play a lot, all of the blue essence you would earn gets front loaded onto your level up so it feels slower even though it's not really.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wean","date":"2018-06-15T02:40:02.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did see Blue Essence discount on certain champions a while ago, I just don't know when it would happen again.\n\nApart from leveling up to receive shard for Blue Essence, you can obtain Blue Essence through missions, however I find that it would be much better if you can also have straight up Blue Essence every time you level up. \n\nHow does that sound?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-06-08T15:33:51.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's late and I'm not expressing my thoughts to well so please do bear with me here.\n\nWhile we all love free stuff, I'm not too sure why you take issue with the new BE if your only qualm is how long it takes to save up for a champion compared to the old system. There was plenty of math done upon the release of the new system, and you gain more BE (effectively) per game than you did IP. The amount of IP you earned was far more dependent on win/loss than EXP is, and while there is some RNG elements, even earning the minimum roll every single time you levelled (which is phenomenally unlikely though not impossible) would only earn you marginally less currency over time than the old system.\n\nThat is also not taking into account the benefits of BE and IP merging, namely the free hextech chests. Now any BE you earn from disenchanting champ shards from Hextech chests can also be used to directly purchase champions, giving you even more currency than was previously available to you. Assuming your rewards aren't locked most players would be unlocking chests reasonably often.\n\nAs to whether it still takes too long to earn enough currency to purchase champions, I feel that is a somewhat different discussion. We earn BE objectively faster than we did IP, not to mention that if you do happen to roll a champion shard for someone you want, you have much more BE available to you to redeem that shard, instead of the measly amounts we had for that use previously.\n\nOf course perception is a whole other matter. Given the number of complaints despite the proof that there was a net benefit (until you reach some ungodly level, at which point you would have all the champs you wanted anyway) it seems fairly obvious that something in the manner in which currency has earned has made progression feel slower.\n\nPersonally I prefer one big reward to lots of smaller ones, but that naturally isn't the case for everyone. I think however the primary issue is the perceived value of the shards. Despite benefiting from the new system, disenchanting a 6300 perceived value into 1260 doesn't feel as good as just earning that 1260 over time, despite the fact that if you're disenchanting it it's because it's a champion you don't want or already own and therefore didn't actually have any value to you.\n\nPersonally I was sitting on 2200~ BE and within three days of Pyke being out I had enough BE to purchase him, even at his higher cost of 7800. I play more than some people but I hardly play all day every day either. Usually a few games a day, sometimes more if we have a big group. Now mind you I did disenchant a 4800 champ shard (980 BE I think?) that I was saving for a mastery upgrade (hadn't played the champ in a while and still needed 3 S/S+ ranks) and opened a hextech chest in that time that had a champ shard in it, but neither of those circumstances are exactly rare or unlikely.\n\nNow could they reduce the cost of champions? I think perhaps if they could push up the discount schedule a little, instead of taking one champ down when a new champ is released, do two or three for the next few since there are a whole heap of 6300 champs at the moment, that would be ok. However I also understand why they don't want to do that, from both a business and gameplay perspective. \n\nSomething like a private champion shop or personalised free to play rotation I feel are certainly options worth exploring, but again the execution has to be careful. I see no particular issues with something like the \"your shop\" for skins, but personalised free to play rotation would likely be off the table or quite heavily limited. The point of free to play rotations is partly to help new player understand more gameplay, and partly to help new or even just not long time players to expand their champion pools. Allowing free personalisation of that would sort of defeat that purpose.","replies":[{"poster":"CauseSCIENCE","date":"2018-06-15T01:13:13.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see what you're getting at, and i imagine running a system like this is hard.

If they treated Blue Essence the way they treated IP, it'd be fine. Nowadays, it takes you somewhat anywhere between 50-100 games just to get a 6300BE champ. I think it's a joke.","replies":[]}]}
