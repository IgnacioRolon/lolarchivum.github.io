A person played ashe in my team had intended to afk from very early into the game. she had no problem with lagging or disconnection from the game. Please review the gameplay with all the chat. there should be enough evidences. Please punish this kind of players. Make them improve their behaviors and improve the gameplay. my in game is : Girl Banh Beo and the afk is :I _Name Removed_ I. i have pictures and willing to provide as evidence. thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-23T00:07:47.200+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I record all my games now and have submitted many reports for abusive flamers/trolls/intentional afks etc. I also state i can provide evidence but i never hear anything back. But thats not to say nothing has been done about it either, i would hate to think how many reports are accumulated on a daily basis and how many would need to be sifted through for 1 single persons actions.\nAll you can do is report and hope it is dealt with accordingly. Also, find some regulars to play with so theres less/zero toxicity in any of your games.\nI have 3 RL friends I play with almost nightly, the 5th is always usually a random and its rare we have a 'bad apple' join our team xD\nGood luck on the rift!","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-08-23T06:10:43.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woah, keep up the good work :D\n\nBTW you mentioned that you _\"never hear anything back\"_. Do you mean **Riot** isn't replying? Because they should reply to every ticket you send in. I'll be happy to look into it for you if that's the case.","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-23T09:31:01.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, to clarify what I meant by \"reporting\" was that I use the report function at post game, and use the comments section to explain I have evidence etc.\nThats probably not the same as \"submitting a ticket\" I presume? So perhaps that's why I never hear back.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-08-23T10:25:58.436+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah MB, so that's the report feedback card, you'll only get that when a player is punished. On the down low here though, it's being reworked so you might be seeing more of it soon ;)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-08-23T12:14:28.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a very insignificant act.

I guess you should not ban to those who are toxic but to those who ruin other players game and make them toxic !!!!! \n\nPlease RIOT use ur brain if not then I am sorry, I feel bad for you","replies":[]}]}
