This is really annoying for me as I am a beginner at LoL so it  cvis really annoying when people flay as Fizz in a \r\nCo-Op vs AI beginner match and completely take all the kills and do it all for you and take the difficulty of it. If you are one of these people please could you not do it, just play PvP and not ruin it for us.
