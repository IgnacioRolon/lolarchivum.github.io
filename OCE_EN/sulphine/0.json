Right-click the speaker on your taskbar and select \"Sounds\".\n2. Switch to the \"Playback\" tab.\n3. Right-click the listing for your headset and select \"Configure speakers\".\n4. Switch the audio channel to mono.\n\nIf the mono option isn't there it usually means that device doesn't support one channel audio, but the vast majority of headsets will. You may also be able to change this in the Logitech Software, and the LGS may in fact override the Windows settings or visa versa, so you might have to play around a bit.","replies":[{"poster":"Sulphine","date":"2019-07-26T15:13:47.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This absolutely fixed my issue, thank you. I went into the ease of access settings in Windows 10 and set Windows to force Mono Audio, thank you for helping me out and I hope you have an amazing day! :)","replies":[]}]}]}
