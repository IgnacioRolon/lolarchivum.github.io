HELP","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys, Now i have an alienware m17x r4 laptop which ive played LoL on for years and its been fine. I normally average around the 100 fps mark, and 30-50 ping. Now recently I have re-intalled windows on my computer, and esentially reset the whole machine back to factory settings. And since ive done this, I reinstalled all my drivers, etc and league, but my fps is now down to 40-60 and always drops to 20ish in team fights. And i get regular HUGE ping spike topping 600 making it unplayable for a few seconds (even minutes)...\r\nMy graphics drivers are up to date, im running my whole computer for 'best performance'.. and everything from what i remember is the exact same as before, so i dont know why it isnt performing the same.\r\nDoes anyone have any ideas as to why its doing this?
