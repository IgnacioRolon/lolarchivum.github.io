So in a nutshell, I&#039;m looking for someone who has been around for a while, played lots of games and is at least decent at the game. I&#039;d like to get better at league, but I&#039;m not sure where to start, I&#039;ve been playing on and off for about 2 years on a few different accounts, some of which I have no access to anymore. I&#039;m not totally horrible, but I&#039;m not great either. If anyone could come play a few matches with me every now and again, and teach me on how to improve my game play I would be grateful. I currently play mid and jungle almost equal amounts, and I also plan on maining Lee Sin. Hit me up if you are willing to help.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nMyDadsDumbFace.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-05-09T04:30:30.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why cant you access your other accounts?","replies":[]}]}
