I play normals as I don&#039;t have enough champs to go into ranked quite yet, (started a new account to play some games with a mate who was lower level, decided to make it my main account after I got 30 super fast) I main jungle Lee and I&#039;m half decent at him as long as I can play with a team that doesn&#039;t feed early. Cheers and have fun, hit me up for details.  {{champion:64}}  ftw","replies":[{"poster":"SoulReaperMX","date":"2016-05-13T00:00:55.385+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: SoulReaperMX\nRole: ADC, Supp, JG\nChamp for each role: Lucian, Leona or Thresh, Trundle\nBeen playing since season three but havnt really played ranked want to join a team, wanna have fun but also win XD\nCurrently Bronze l hopefully soon to be Silver","replies":[{"poster":"The TeemoNator","date":"2016-05-13T02:20:06.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is NA posting on a OCE looking for team thread...
