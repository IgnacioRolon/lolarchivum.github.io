It just straight up either crashes and says something like &quot;Cannot connect&quot;\r\nI&#039;ve looked for the issue online and can&#039;t find a fix. I believe its not on my end, because of this issue I&#039;ve been placed twice now in low priority queue and I&#039;m a bit pissed over it. I&#039;m not purposefully leaving games or afking, yet I&#039;m still being punished for something I didn&#039;t do.\r\nI have so far, re installed completely, checked and double checked my net. (I have nbn), tried several other small things, but I just had the issue again.","replies":[]}
