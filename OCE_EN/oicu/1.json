Other players that want to flame others or bait them into an argument. These people do it to piss other players off.\r\n\r\nI continuously report these players and I continuously get no  feed back from Riot","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-03-27T03:33:25.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Troller feeders:** There is a big difference between intent feeders, and players that are just tilted/bad. Riot can tell the difference between intent feeding and being bad (thankfully, otherwise I would be permabanned 1000x over), intent feeders are punished but bad players are not. \n\nWhile intent feeding is a massive issue and the detection systems need to be a lil quicker in responding, it isn't actually as common as everyone makes out. Out of my past 50 or so games, I have only encountered 2 intent feeders (both have been banned now). Less than 5 intent feeders per 50 games is probably the norm around most ranks, with the exception of low bronze.\n\nI went through your match history for the past 20 ranked games you have played, and found a whopping 0 intent feeders on either team. I did find plenty of players with below average scores, but they are in low bronze for a reason. \n\n**Plain trolls:** Those who refuse to group and refuse to listen to pings are super annoying, and I totally get where you are coming from. Unfortunately, you can't actually report them for this. This happens in every rank, but gets slightly better as you move up. Bronze (as you know) is the worst for this kind of behaviour, as most players are playing with a \"solo carry\" mentality and want to splitpush or just don't care about the rest of their team. The best you can do in situations like these is to type in chat to them, being super nice and super encouraging and start taking control. \n\nYou can read more about player behaviour systems [HERE](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/Y9YJ60Fn-player-behaviour-faq) and the upcoming tribunal [HERE](https://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answers/134200448962).\n\nYou can also read about r[eportable and non-reportable behaviour here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player) (keep in mind it is quite outdated and the r[eport categories have been revamped.) ](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JCwL8706qZk/ViAdgsIzgoI/AAAAAAAAy20/uibMA7oozLo/s1600/n2BJwC2.png)\n\nIn terms of indefinitely avoiding these players and brining the fun back into league of legends, [I would suggest joining a premade team](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment). You build relationships, can learn to fit with each others play styles, have A+ communication and avoid toxins like feeders/afks/general potatoes. With all of the incentives being thrown at you such as, increased IP, mastery points and hex tech stuff, there is literally nothing to lose ♥","replies":[{"poster":"OICU","date":"2016-08-28T15:04:25.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"ARE YOU SERIOUS buddy ? i hope to god you do not get payed for your job. \nI get a troll or a feeder or both in each and every game i play either on my team or the others. \nThere is not a big difference. If you feed 5 kills at the start then play safe for the rest it looks like you had an average game but you just snowballed the laner you just fed the game is basically over unless you have a smurf on your team or the other team has been feeding and steamrolling someone on your team. YES people DO feed 5 kills within 5 min IT IS intentional NOT a bad player. \n\nWAKE UP RIOT !\nTROLLS HAVE OVERTAKEN OUR GAME","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-08-29T08:12:30.876+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow that 5 month reply time. \n\nLet's clear some stuff up. \n1. im not a Rioter\n2. My involvement on the boards is voluntary. \n\nThere are times in games where I die in lane a number of times in quick succession, am I a troll? No. I just have bad games. There are so many players that do this in any elo, while it isn't the best, it also isn't trolling. \n\nI mean, of course there are intent feeders and trolls, but more often than not the type of player you are complaining it about isn't doing it intentionally. I could look at your match history, bring up the games where you did not so well and notice that in many of them you have died in quick succession in a number of them. Are you a troll? \n\nYou are in bronze 5. You are at the lowest of the low, where players (including yourself) are inconsistent af. One game they may go 1/10, in another they may go 18/6 (oh look, I'm using your match history as an example).\n\n>If you feed 5 kills at the start then play safe for the rest it looks like you had an average game but you just snowballed the laner you just fed the game is basically over unless you have a smurf on your team or the other team has been feeding and steamrolling someone on your team.\n\nIt appears you have quite a negative mindset in regards to playing from behind, I think if you look at changing this you might climb a bit better. Learn to play from behind, learn to control snowballs, learn to encourage your team and keep everyone working together until the end. There is no reason for you to say \"gg\" as soon as the game is 0/5.","replies":[{"poster":"OICU","date":"2016-08-30T14:57:22.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Wow, some people have a life. \n\nYou sound like you really need to get one bud \nYou are a pretentious wanker.\n\nIf you had any idea of the problems in Bronze you would know straight away what i am talking about. \nIT appears You are A W A N K E R.\n\nYou have no idea YET you really think you do.
