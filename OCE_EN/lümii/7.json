Why retire something that people actually want to purchase? I cant find it anywhere, ebay, amazon, facebook. Why Retire something that people want? retire the stuff no one wants like coasters...\r\n\r\nI feel its really disappointing riot missed this. multiple tickets in, saying they dont know when it will be restocked, to look and see its retired... come on.. a massive company, constantly putting out new merch but couldnt put out another restock? \r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} {{sticker:sg-janna}} {{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[]}
