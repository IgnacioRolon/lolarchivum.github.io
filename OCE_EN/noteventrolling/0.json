Im getting tired of playing and losing just because someone dc and that is pretty much game lost yea they will get reported but im still losing alot of points for something i did't do or plan to happen i just think its unfair for other players. so can league do something about this because i don't know how much more i can take before i just stop playing ranked. As it is in oceania not many people play rank and auto fill was made which makes even more games lost because people get roles they can't play. if you make it we lose no point and if we have an dc your problem thinking team mates will go and dc to help keep there team mates from not losing points. just make it who ever goes and dc loses more points like 25 or even 30 and it should stop it.","replies":[{"poster":"FerrousOxide","date":"2016-12-06T08:56:52.283+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Houestly, Remake did a good job of fixing the DC at start problem. Later game, I think riot should have a banned form ranked punishment. Where a player with connection issues or anger issues(rage quitting after feeding).. or 12vie issues (intentional feeding/trolling after feeding) in ranked games shoudl be banned from ranked games.While i understand the lag and connection issue may not be the players fault; Constantly persisting on tying ranked when you know you have a bad connection like the other things i mentioned detract form the enjoyment of others and should still be moderated against. Keep the toxic players in normal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-12-06T01:22:40.053+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quick lads we are going to lose someone afk so we dont lose our LP!","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-06T03:16:19.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, does that mean ranked trolls are the people who don't afk?
