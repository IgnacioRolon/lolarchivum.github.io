This year, when we think about what we want to improve about our game systems, the word that comes to mind is \"adaptability\".","url":"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/road-pre-season-gameplay-systems-update","image":null},"up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The removal of smite buffs are coming next season and it is by far the worst idea I have ever heard. \r\n\r\nThe reasoning for removing the smite buffs are incomprehensible conclusions, stating that because a group of people don&#039;t use them to their full potential or incorrectly the option should be removed and replaced with simple RNG aspects (which Riot stated they wanted to move away from). This is the equivalent of removing the ADC role because a group of people only play top and don&#039;t know how to succeed in that role. \r\n\r\nThis is basically removing half of the skill potential in both standard norms and ranked games. I can understand wanting to make the game easier as you&#039;ll attract new players, and also give your current lower skilled players an easier aspect to learn, but you have to understand that as a game some people are just going to be better at certain aspects of said game than others are. For example you wouldn&#039;t remove Zed, Zilean, or Azir mechanics just because a group of people don&#039;t know how to play them. Edit them sure but not remove an ability or champion completely.\r\n\r\nNot only is the removal of smite buffs hindering skill potential, but it&#039;s also removing a players trust within your development team. Why spend all this time practicing skill and mechanics when the whole game is slowly going to be turned into a D&amp;D game?\r\n\r\nNow wanting to spice up the game for the new season is also completely understandable, and having buffs for higher skill potential is also a great utility in the game. So why can&#039;t we have both? Why not keep the buffs, and add the plants (with the exception of the honeysuckle which would be too OP to have as well as the buffs). \r\n\r\nThat way everyone&#039;s happy, Riot gets to move ~~away~~ into their RNG aspects for the lower skill cap, and people who don&#039;t understand how a smite buff works can use the plants and jungle camps (or they could just read the innumerable tutorials on the internet of how to jungle because you&#039;re not the embodiment of Lee Sin), and people who have actually put time and effort into their learning of the game can keep the buffs that they&#039;ve trained around.\r\n\r\nThis way no one gets the virtual carpet ripped out from underneath them.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-10-15T04:20:06.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that Smite buffs shouldn't be removed, but i am very much against these plants at current.\n\nIt's a needless random element that will just dick people over based on RNG, and doesn't really benefit anyone in a good position.\n\nHoneyfruit: Oh i'm kinda low/full health, i'm just going to take this to Reset my health/Deny the Plant\n\nBlast Cone: Oh i'm just going to run past this and actually get away when i shouldn't (Unless the enemy player notices the thing and walks around it.\n\nScryer's Bloom: I honestly find this one funny, because the use that Riot shows us is retarded, because this would only occur if the enemy jungler was bad, because if that plant is there, you squash it THEN do dragon, and nothing is accomplished in the scheme of things, Not to mention it looks massive (the vision cone), and kind of game breaking.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2016-10-15T02:02:02.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i cant wait to get cucked my these plants","replies":[]}]}
