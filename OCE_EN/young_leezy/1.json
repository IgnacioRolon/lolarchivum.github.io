Nothing has changed with my internet.\r\nMy Champion will randomly stand still for 3-6 seconds, the minions will continue hitting each other but not doing damage, and enemy and allied champions will slowly float around, until all of a sudden, i'll unfreeze and all the animations will catch up at the same time, and if it happens during a teamfight/splitpush/any time after 35 mins I'm usually dead by then. I've lost a fair few games due to this and I don't want to play anymore until I get it solved.\r\n\r\nThis happens at least 10 times a game, other than that I have amazing ping, sitting around 15-30. I've got no problems with my internet besides this. So far I've tried restarting my PC and Power cycling my router, putting my computer in the DMZ, and tried playing at different hours of the day. any help at all would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm with TPG unlimited, if it matters.\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"GBids","date":"2014-12-13T00:55:11.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes this is happening to me too  and i am shocked no one else has posted a complaint  about it till you\nat first i thought it was just my net but since the latest patch  i get lag spikes disconnection  sometime even my ping \ngoes up i normaly have a steady 37-39 ping","replies":[{"poster":"Miluka","date":"2014-12-16T07:14:43.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same thing happening here as well, i have Telstra ADSL 2+.. normally my ping is around 29 maybe 40 on a bad day.\nbut these disconnects are consistant.","replies":[]}]}]}
