I wouldn&#039;t have cared about this if it was just the temporary ban, but points for this as well, when I did everything I could to join, is a bit angering. Is there anyway you could help me with this? Thanks.\r\n\r\n/&quot;MrBiG84&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-09T12:00:43.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Might have been that you had the misfortune of lagging during that exact moment. Goes to show that you shouldn't leave a few seconds on the timer to select a champion.\n\nYou probably won't have that loss removed from your profile, as it was a promotion. You can't have people leaving promo games, and it was what you agreed to when you started ranked.\n\nBest of luck in the future, though!","replies":[{"poster":"MrBiG84","date":"2015-04-09T13:13:34.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wasn't a promotion series, if that's what you mean. The only thing Im annoyed about is the loss of points you get from \"dodging\" solo ranked champion select, when I really didn't do anything wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-10T08:47:22.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, sorry, I misinterpreted \"but points for this as well\" as a result of a loss on your profile, which I'm all to familiar with in my promo games. Haven't actually left a normal ranked game, so I didn't know the point penalty applies there too.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
