Almost every game, and the worst thing is its not even spread across teams. Like one is all high ranks and the other is all low. rito really screwed the pooch again. How are you going to learn if you are a bronze or silver adc paired with a bronze or silver sup and you vs a plat adc and a gold sup. Its not even remotely fair, you get stomped, everyone starts bitching each other out and then someone afks. Pretty consistent experience across the last 20 or so games. Even when you trash your lane opp the mid game difference in golds and plats vs bronze and silver means its just one of the most annoying experiences I have ever had in ranked, and we dont have draft normals, so its aram or ranked coz blind picks sucks donkey balls.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Orange Caramel","date":"2016-11-13T01:34:03.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone starts with the same mmr.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MaNiC","date":"2016-11-13T00:24:42.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\nsame here \n\n[](https://gyazo.com/292bc3e45df9eb2cbf3d7aa4c7fc34c2)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Anıma","date":"2016-11-12T06:45:34.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's flex queue and it's purely to test preseason changes and to kinda get a feel for your mmr for next season.

Ranked is purely for people who want to practise stuff and get used to the changes around this time not for super duper climbing™.

But it just makes my games not fun when one team is all Gold and above and the other all silver. I can't get better in that game. That game only makes me and my team mates frustrated. I know I'm not that good, last season was the first time I got out of bronze after playing 6 years. However Ranked is still the most enjoyable experience I have in League, I hate normal queue, no one takes the game seriously, and we have no draft normal on OCE, so what am I supposed to do for the next few months? Not play at all??? If flex queue is going to allow this then the new system is worse than last season.","replies":[{"poster":"Anıma","date":"2016-11-12T12:19:34.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a side note I've gotten an all gold team + me verse full diamonds I know the pain sometimes.
