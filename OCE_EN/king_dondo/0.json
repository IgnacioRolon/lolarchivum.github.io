I feel leaver busters for half the time would accomplish the same thing they do in America.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-10-14T06:21:01.180+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"LPQs shouldn't be affecting the matchmaking system. What they're designed to do is implement a \"must wait\" period at the start of a given queue time for anyone who has received low-tier punishments relating to leaving, AFKing and/or otherwise disconnecting in-game. Once you've waited out that \"must wait\" period, the queue is treated like any other. If you're experiencing problems in-queue, I'd recommend submitting a ticket via [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) and explaining the situation to them. You can also submit a ticket if you believe you have been falsely punished, though you would need to submit separate tickets for each issue.\n\nIt's possible the issue may be related to the queue population, which can be affected by which mode/map you are queuing for and when you are queuing during the day and week. If you're experiencing the issue at different times in different modes/maps, it's likely a different issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Plutooh","date":"2017-10-17T03:30:43.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As was mentioned you are only punished by having to wait X amount of time before joining the queue. i.e. A friend had a power blackout a few times during a thunderstorm and came back and had a popup on screen telling him he had to wait 5 minutes before he could join the next game. Once those 5 minutes were up he could join a queue normally.\n\nI played this morning for an hour or so and never had issues joining a game and was usually in queue for no more than a minute or two.\n\nAt the end of the day though when you are playing with others as a team each person relies on the other to play a part, if you're internet is that bad you really shouldn't be playing games like league, I think the system works quite well, only thing I would change is dodgers having to wait even longer.","replies":[]}]}
