I learnt how to manage his fury for maximised trades, ability combinations for trade/teamfight potential and how to animation cancel his W with Tiamat/Hydra passive. All these things make me feel satisfied when I play Renekton, and make the enemy melee top laner sad.\r\n\r\nHowever, I find myself constantly hampered when I activate Renekton&#039;s ultimate, because the ability requires a brief period to activate in which Renekton becomes stationary. This provides a window of opportunity to run away from (or turn and fight) Renekton that becomes an annoyance, especially when Slicing and Dicing onto the enemy carry. I believe Nasus also has this stationary period.\r\n\r\nSo my question: is there a way to animation cancel Renekton&#039;s ultimate, similar to Riven&#039;s Wind Slash, that allows the Gator to integrate his ultimate into his trade/engage patterns flawlessly and without pausing? It would allow Renekton&#039;s trades and engages to be a lot more dangerous if there is, and improve my playstyle.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2015-05-18T02:34:47.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe I've seen Renektons in LCS and such use their W and Ult at the same time.","replies":[]}]}
