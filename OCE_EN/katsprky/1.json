Someone put up a thread asking about a lack of guides so I thought I would through one up focusing on general skirmishes, engages and map awareness. The keywords will be at the bottom of this guide.\n\nStarting off I want to bring to light a very useful mechanic in every role though this does shine more highly in the marksman / adc role.\n\n* Range Leashing. \n\n> The best way to describe this is when playing a champion like Caitlyn (650) and versing someone like Sivir (500). Sivir has the advantage of being able to block Caitlyn ult and her Q poke but Caitlyn during levels 1-5 has a massive advantage, assuming that the Caitlyn player can dodge Boomerang blade (Sivir&#039;s Q.) By being able to use a non dodge-able attack. Now before we go any further we must take into account the movement speed of these champions since you move the amount of units your movement speed is per second we assume that it&#039;ll take Sivir _roughly 0.4_ seconds to catch up to Caitlyn and AA her if Caitlyn does this from max range.  ~~The next section will show how to make this easier.~~ By doing this you ensure a easy way to deal damage to them while not taking damage yourself. We can also use this for last hitting, if we keep out of their champions range but keep the minions in our range we&#039;re able to last hit them without taking damage. \n\n* Stutter-Stepping / Orb Walking / Auto Attack Canceling.\n\n> So what is this so called \"Stutter-stepping?\" It&#039;s where you start the animation for auto attacking but stop it half way through making the damaging animation connect but the recovery animation stopped. \"Isn&#039;t this only useful on ranged champions?\" It&#039;s actually not, the first few champions that come to mind when mentioning this is Rengar and Xin Zhao. They&#039;re the easier melee champions to do this on in my opinion. Xin Zhao because when his spear is fully extended the damage will always apply and Rengar because, Rengar AA is really hard to cancel. How to do this on a ranged champion? When the projectile leaves your weapon... *cough* okay you have to wait 0.1 seconds afterwards otherwise the projectile will happen but deal no damage because Riot is a derpface on this. This actually made me question if it was theoretical bug abuse that&#039;s next to impossible to tell if you&#039;re doing it on purpose or not however with Kalista&#039;s passive it became clear that it was intended which also brings up that Riot really! Really! Should fix that bug.\n> So... What&#039;s the practical use for this? If we look back at Range leashing we notice there was 0.4 seconds where Sivir had to catch up to Caitlyn to get an AA back on Cait to not take free damage. If Cait Stutter-steps the AA she is doing she can make it next to impossible for Sivir to catch up to her and given how large Caitlyn&#039;s AA range is she&#039;ll be able to AA Sivir once she gives up trying to AA Cait back.\n\nPlease just call it Stutter-stepping though.\n\n* Animation Canceling.\n\n> A really, really easy one to bring up is Caitlyns Q,E Combo. You cast Q and E withing 0.1 seconds of each other. What this does is it gets you out of danger while still out-putting damage for minimal cost in time. This way you can disengage, deal a decent amount of damage while doing so and then counter-engage if you dealt enough damage. (An example of this is when you&#039;re trying to finish off a low HP-Target that can&#039;t be killed by your ult so you Q,E deal damage to them under tower and then ult them.) \n> - A lot of champions can do this, Cho&#039;Gath W,Q. Thresh E,Q, Azir E,Q... Kinda.. Also Riot really like E,Q combo&#039;s... This is not to mistake with ability without channel time. Someone like Xin Zhao who can cast Q and W at the same time without it requiring for him to complete an animation beforehand doesn&#039;t count under this category. Same with Rengar Q,W. While they do interupt you AA there is 0 delay between Q and W as ability&#039;s. *Jinx Ult, W can be animation canceled although Jinx W, E wouldn&#039;t count as an animation cancel.\n\n(Yes those 3 subjects are something Doublelift had in a guide a long time ago.)\n\n* Spell Shield. - Long part\n\n> What's the use of a spell shield? It doesn't block AA damage? But it does block a possibly killing blow or a CC effect that may get you killed in the near future. There are different types of spell shields. The most common one would be Nocturne's which will (Or should!) only block one ability and give him/her/it attack speed for correctly blocking an ability with it. Since most spell shields block 1 ability and then give you something else some people debate \"Is it worth saving it or getting the second part of the ability?\" In most cases I would say to save it until you're going all in or you're running away since they do still cost a small portion of mana excluding Sivir's which is free and grants mana back making it useful against ability based poke champions in lane. That being said, in the later part of the game it's highly not recommended to block an ability for the second part of the shield since your enemies see that as a \"GO!\" sign and will jump on your face. The other type of spell shield would be Morgana's Black Shield which will block as many AP ability's and the CC portion of the ability until the shield is broken. The shield can only be broken by AP based attacks meaning it's hard for an physical based champions to break the shield and apply their CC affects. There are some ability's which do ignore the first type of Spell Shield (Sivir's, Nocturnes, Etc) which are AoE land effects like Singed's Mega Adhesive or Vladimir's Sanguine pool. Which apply slow's and damaging effects. Since they weren't targeted at the Spell Shield their affects don't get stopped by the spell shield (also because it would just break and reapply 0.5 seconds later.) However Morgana's black shield will stop the effects both parts the damage part and the slow part until the shield breaks or the duration wears out.\n\n*  Attack Moving.\n\n> The basic use of doing this is to attack the first thing that comes into you Auto Attack Range. This is generally only useful on marksman's due to the innate nature to AA a lot. How we use this is by holding down the left shift key, pressing the a button and right clicking or the x button and right clicking (It can be rebound in the options menu.) I personally see this as a safe guard. How so? Because when you right click someone to attack them you always have the chance of missing them and starting to walk towards them. If you blink then you don't realize sooner, your position is worse than it was before, you're not dealing dps to anything and it could get you killed. That's why when you attack move you'll attack the closest thing to you if nothing is selected. (Would be nice if it auto-targeted champs over minions.) So instead of walking derply into the enemies face you'll attack something else instead. This is also a problem though if you attack someone next to your target (E.G; Tibbers) you might not notice that you are attacking the wrong target if you look  to see who is approaching you or what skill shot to dodge leading to you dealing next to worthless dps for an extended period of time. However this is still better than walking into their face and dying. Another great way to use attack move is to attack move in front of you and click behind you with a normal move command, this way if anything walks into range in-front of you, you'll attack it and then walk backwards basically creating an easier version of stutter stepping. \n- You can also use this to chase into bushes and attack them the moment you re-gain vision of them and/or attack anyone when face-checking a bush if someone is wait for you. You might crit them and scare them off.\n\n* Different types of Shields\n\n> I don't think this is a very mechanical thing but skims more over the game knowledge part, regardless I wanted it to be an adaption to the spell shield to be more clear on how spell shields work. There are several different types of shield. Magical ones, like Morgana's and Hexdrinker/Maw's one. There are then all damage type ones like Seraphs embrace or Locket of the Iron Solari. These are told between the colours that adds to your health bar when casted. A white one should block any type of damage that comes to hit you while a purple(ish) one will only block ability powered based damage. [Here's a link to all the shields in the game.](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Shield) to learn and tell the difference. (I feel like there is no reason for me to describe them all here when they're already easily understood on the wikia.) Besides those two there are another \"type\" of shields being Yasuo's Windwall (W) and Braum's Unbreakable \"E\" which block all projectiles that come in contact with those two shields Yasuo's removing the projectile from the game while Braum takes the hit for his allies.\n\nEnd part \n\n> I don&#039;t take full credit to this guide I am just relaying information I have gathered in the past and posting it here as it might get more light than a 3 year old guide that takes 2 hours to find would. I think this is about all I want to talk about today as if I keep going and it&#039;s written poorly then next to no one will gain anything from it. I will update this guide from time to time every time something comes to mind.\n\nKeywords: \n> MS == Movement speed\n> AA == Auto attack.\n> ADC == Attack Damage Carry\n> AoE == Area of Effect\n> CC == Crowd Control (It's a term for stuns, snares, silences, roots, etc. That game from WoW IIRC)\n> IIRC == If I remember correctly\n> ~~Anything with a line through it~~ == Relevant part later in the guide.\n> - == Side note to this subject.\n\n\n*Tip: Your carry is referred to the person that is dealing a large amount of damage to enemy champions or structures. For instance ADC would mean your physical type of damage carry. While APC would mean your Ability power type of damage carry.","replies":[{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-04-27T02:50:09.808+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"m8 If I ever see an adc play correctly on oce ill be rly happy","replies":[{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-04-27T04:12:23.377+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i cri if det happens 750/750 stacked tear {{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-08-03T00:43:20.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the advice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Katsprky","date":"2015-08-01T10:09:46.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll bring this back to light since I haven't played for awhile.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2015-05-24T08:55:15.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So when you Attack Move by pressing x button and right clicking, do you actually move?
