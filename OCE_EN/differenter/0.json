For example, you buy 3 Shen for total 6g but only sell the 2 star Shen for 4g.\r\n\r\nIs this a bug or supposed to be? If it's designed to be like this, I suggest better let the selling and buying always be equal.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2019-07-06T21:15:24.991+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its on purpose since 2 star+ are valuable units reducing their gold price for levelling them is a bit of a disinsentive for people hogging characters that dont actually fit their comp to deny enemies. curbs the rng a tad","replies":[]},{"poster":"Plasmarine","date":"2019-07-07T13:04:12.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's intentional and smart. Stops people from buying champions purely for the sake of it and selling for the same value. Almost every single game out there that has the option to sell things in it  usually gives you a return of half (sometimes less). The gold return in this is quite generous and actually makes you think about what you genuinely want to buy instead of \"yolo\" purchasing every unit with no downfall.","replies":[]}]}
