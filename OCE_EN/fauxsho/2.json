Even if you rejoin after you manage to get back in.\r\n\r\nSure this is okay, I only bring this up as I encountered it last night. My launcher had corrupted after the patch, I could get in to the client, but couldn't load the game due to a missing .dll\r\nRepaired the client, managed to get back into the ARAM about just over half way through.\r\n\r\nCool, I didn't 'leave' as such, but I understand the Leaver Buster notification.\r\nMy real point here is the fact that it asks you to state that you agree that you won't leave games in the future.\r\nUnfortunately I have a few issues with this.\r\n\r\n1. Forcing people to lie, because sometimes this can't be helped. Sure I can say I won't do that, but with this scenario, leaving games can occasionally not be helped due to technical issues as described above. I am now held accountable to my acknowledgement that I agree never to leave games again even though that is more than likely a promise I can't keep. I can keep a promise to try not to, but I can't guarantee I won't.\r\n\r\n2. It asks if you agree to a statement. But then just leaves a blank text box for your reply. I sat there for a good 5 minutes after the game typing is all sorts. 'Yes, 'Yes, I do\", \"I do\" etc. Until I eventually typed in \"I agree\" which let me go forward.\r\n\r\nCould it be implemented to actually prompt the user what the desired response is? It's frustrating to get a warning like this, and then not know how to proceed upon getting the warning. A simple check box maybe instead of a text box?\r\nOr a note stating, \"If you agree, type I Agree in the following text box\" etc.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I like the new LeaverBuster system, I just think it needs a few tweaks.\r\n\r\nTL;DR Leaverbuster warning needs prompts to guide user to what the desired response is instead of them guessing.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading all of this if you spent the time to.\r\nAs a reward here's a puppy.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2014-11-26T01:35:55.456+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, \n\nYou can find a lot more information about LeaverBuster [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/kiV9lxOE-collection-of-riot-lytes-important-posts-on-the-leaverbuster)\n\nAnd I will try to talk a bit about your two points\n\n1. The first warning is to inform players that leaving is wrong and negatively affects the game for 9 other people. \nUnless you're bugsplatting or DCing multiple games in a row, you won't see anything beyond the first warning. The new system only attack chronic leavers/AFKs, not the occasional emergencies.\n\n2. I believe before you type anything the area where you type says something along the lines of - Type \"I agree\" here (Maybe this could be clearer)","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSho","date":"2014-11-26T01:56:02.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for the info. I will have to look into it further and check out some more about the changes.. Obviously all I know of it so far is what I have experienced.\nI don't think I've truly ever left a game before, it was only after having to replace a faulty SSD, reinstalling Windows, and I trying to play an ARAM that some files were missing and well yeah.\n\nI guess I may have missed something in my quick reading of the LeaverBuster popup after the game. I don't really intend on 'testing' the LeaverBuster any time soon.\n\nJust thought it may be worthwhile to bring a discussion forth about how it currently is informing players, or if I was just having a brain fade last night.\n\nThanks for the reply. :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2014-11-26T01:04:03.159+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oooo Cute Puppy, but i got the same message after a blackout (Officer Caitlyn got one as well more recently) after the blackout i managed to get back into the game roughly 15 mins in, then proceeded to win. after that i got the message blah blah\n\ntyped i agree got another blackout within an hour of the first one, message came up again\n\nThe checkbox must be put into use so that we can describe what happened, why we left\n\nSuch as \n\nPower outage\nMissing File\nFirewall error\nClicked leave game (no one will take responsibility, so likely no click)\nOther - Describe in box bellow\n\nRiot this will make life less difficult","replies":[]},{"poster":"Molendo","date":"2014-11-27T07:46:38.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes its understandable that you get technical issues which cant be helpedbut that happens once in a blue moon if u dont have a toaster/ crap internet.\n\nI like this new system because its basically making people think twice before they leave games,  which will help people have a better experience in - game and overall.","replies":[]}]}
