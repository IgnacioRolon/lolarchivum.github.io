I don't think I've ever had a transaction take this long via PayPal. It's always pretty instant for me.\n\nIs this normal for Riot Games Hong Kong transactions?","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-12-08T04:45:38.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I recall right it can take between 3 - 5 days to process, at least with Westpac, I get it in Monday morning and it's ready by Thursday morning.","replies":[]},{"poster":"csm","date":"2014-12-08T04:26:58.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope paypal is ok","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSho","date":"2014-12-08T04:31:19.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On second thought I forgot my PayPal is set as an instant Bank Transfer which means it may take a while depending on the bank I guess....\nBut I've never had it happen before, so it's a little strange.\n\nIf it's still like this tomorrow I'll be asking some questions. Apparently shipping is 3-4 days so as long as it it processed by tomorrow that's the main thing.","replies":[]}]}]}
