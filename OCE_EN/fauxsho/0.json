Boards have finally shined upon us.\r\nI'm unsure of what I feel about it currently, but so far I actually have no real gripes with it.\r\n\r\nThey look nicer. (Yes I know it is reddit styled, but that aside, the colour scheme and outlay is nicer imo)\r\nI feel like the discussions so far have been much more positive, which back on the forums was a rarity, so whether it's the boards or people changing, either way, it's nice to see the positivity. \r\n\r\nI guess the boards go well with the new Summoner's Rift, a new look rift, deserves a new look place for discussion.\r\nOn that topic, what are people's thoughts on the new SR. I found the first few games I was a little lost, for lack of a better word. It was a little disorientating at first, but I think I've grown to really like it. All the intricacies of buffs spawning in, and changing forms, to the changes of the map, with destruction of towers, and so on. I don't think I've noticed a performance hit, if anything it seems to perform better for me. Whether that is due to me having a high'ish end machine who knows.\r\n\r\nI am starting to like Team Builder as well, it seems to be working much better which is nice, although I have mostly used it in only with a group of 4-5 people, games are queueing extremely quickly, with also very close games being played which is awesome!\r\n\r\nEither way, I look forward to this new chapter in League!","replies":[{"poster":"MasterMirkinen","date":"2014-11-19T04:45:34.196+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks FauxSho,\nGood to see you like these changes. Loads of Rioters spent days and nights on them.\nI'm someone who is normally reluctant to changes (I.e. we recently switched from Outlook to Gmail for email management and I was really against it bit now I'm loving it) so it took some time to get used to the updated SR and the new boards but I can already tell you I'll love them in the long run!","replies":[{"poster":"Zastarx","date":"2014-11-20T12:33:09.848+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This just happened a few weeks back at the helpdesk I work for.
