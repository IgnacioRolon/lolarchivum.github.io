Yesterday i tried building Infinity Edge because of the crit... and honestly it is the most broken thing on him. When u go back first, buy the cheapest crit chance item (should be around 400) then buy cheapest attacl speed item, if u r taking damage buy armor if not then get a long sword... trust me on this... it works so well early game... and in late game for some reason u heal like nuts...\nBtw a build u should stick to is\nBoots of Attack Speed\nBOTRK\nRavenous Hydra\nInfinity Edge\nGA\n\nThe last item depends on their team... if they have AP build Maw of Malmortius\nIf there teams is full AD then i suggest building a little bit more armor or health, or buy more lifesteal like BloodThirster if u r ahead \n**:) GLHF**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-08-09T03:58:56.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not an Aatrox main or nor do i play him very much. \n\n\nSo what I think would be good on him would be:\n\n{{item:3153}}: Synergizes with his kit very well must get. \n{{item:3074}} : Optional first rush for better wave clear and burst\n{{item:3072}} ,{{item:3812}} pick up if you didn't rush Ravenous\n{{item:3742}}, {{item:3143}} : third item\n{{item:3065}} : Third item if dealing with a lot of magic damage or otherwise make it fourth. \n{{item:3053}}, {{item:3156}} : Build if dealing with lots of burst.\n\n{{item:3006}} or {{item:3009}} are optimal boots\n\n{{item:1416}}  Only notably good item for the jungle on Aatrox.\n\nRemember to optimize your build to your situation rather than simply following a flat guide.
