Its great to see you are open to advice in your journey. I'll talk about two things to try and help you on the Ranked Ladder. Your game play and how to improve and your attitude towards the game.\n\nI'm going to start with attitude first because I believe this is one of the most important things to get right before you can improve and climb fast. \n\n**Attitude**\nWhen you are playing Ranked focus on your own game play, never look to push blame onto others. Unless you are literally Faker then there are probably things you could have done better to put your team in a position to win. Check out this video from Gbay99 - https://youtu.be/5MTO2a7ZFcc\n\nAlways stay positive, if you don't have something nice to say don't say it. If you are negative in your team chat not only will you add fire to the fuel but you could also potentially start your team on a downward spiral to fighting each other in chat instead of playing the game and trying to win. Remember League of Legends is a team game you have to work together as a team to win. #TeamWorkOP - https://youtu.be/ugXC7g3p0JU\n\n**Gameplay**\nYou've only just started on your ranked journey, there is going to be a lot to learn (hell I've played for 4 years and still have lots to learn). Don't get discouraged by losses and make sure you learn something from every death (why did you die? were you out of position? misjudged damage of opponent? etc) and make sure you always continue to learn about the game. There is a lot more to this game than just csing and fighting champions.\n\nCheck out this sick play list from UNSW LoL Society - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9RdXhXESRJzgY_SwHB8T-cZxXljWhQvz\n\nIt will teach you a lot about trading in lane, lane control, team fighting, and also how to use a lead.\n\nHope this all helps and good luck on the Rift!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bradilz","date":"2016-08-15T00:03:21.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you looking for a full team?","replies":[{"poster":"dilzter","date":"2016-08-15T00:04:51.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bradilz,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=lNEPE2R7,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-08-15T00:03:21.393+0000)\n>\n> Are you looking for a full team?\n\nnot a full team its just in solo queue because i have not played in ranked teams yet.","replies":[{"poster":"Bradilz","date":"2016-08-15T00:09:35.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dilzter,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=lNEPE2R7,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-08-15T00:04:51.647+0000)\n>\n> not a full team its just in solo queue because i have not played in ranked teams yet.\n\nwell I think the main Idea of ranked is to play with friends","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-08-15T04:46:17.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the idea of ranked is supossed to be a competitive environment to improve on, rather than just the \"casual\" setting of normal game, i understand where you are coming from but if you are just playing with friends in ranked just coz, you should be really playing innormals not ranked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dilzter","date":"2016-08-15T00:13:52.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bradilz,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=lNEPE2R7,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2016-08-15T00:09:35.264+0000)\n>\n> well I think the main Idea of ranked is to play with friends\n\nnot if you are the only one who wants to play","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
