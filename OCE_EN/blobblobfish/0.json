WHERE ARE YOU TALON?? WHY DO YOU LET THESE YASUO HATERS RUN FREE????!?!?\n\nAlso I use to think that Yasuo was bullshit too but then I realised complaining about it's not gonna do anything because there has legitimately been hundreds of posts before you asking for the same thing. Also he's really not that bs after nerfs, just gotta bait out his wind wall then ez game ez life.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-09-20T07:42:46.253+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He was 100% broken up until the nerfs. Now he is in a very good spot. He doesn't pull damage out his ass, you see skilled Yasuos thrive and wannabee ones fail. He has the potential to be put behind now instead of dumb scaling, but he also has a very high skill cap for strong damage and outplays and a lot of variety.\n\nOf course, I never lose to a Yasuo now only because I hate the champion with every part of my body, so I just get a camp on me and destroy him. He can't come back. I love bullying Yasuos. But yeah he is very well balanced for both roles now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-19T22:28:50.232+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Go away.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Damocracy","date":"2016-09-19T22:57:17.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:157}} is a high skill champ so nerfs are not needed. {{champion:157}} can be locked down with hard cc.

Go and play yas. Until then you cannot comment on how much skill yasuo requires to play.\nUntil you do you will never climb in ranked. Judging by your win/loss ration in ranked you are destined for bronze 2. It's taken me three years to start climbing in this game because I can learn the strength and weaknesses of a champ.\nStop being a noob and start playing champs to see what they are strong at and what they are weak at.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
