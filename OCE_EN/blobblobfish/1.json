After that go to your program files and look for the league of legends game folder and copy the game folder into a portable storage device. After that everytime you want to play league just load your game from the portable storage device and the key bindings should be the same even if you play league on different computers.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-08-05T09:40:19.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you try this let me know","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DontTalkIhateYou","date":"2015-08-05T07:19:54.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"buy a better keyboard, my razer keyboard does everything you mentioned and more :)","replies":[{"poster":"DontTalkIhateYou","date":"2015-08-05T07:21:22.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and yes it unplugs via usb and retains its info so its easily portable","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-08-05T09:39:19.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some people have laptops.
