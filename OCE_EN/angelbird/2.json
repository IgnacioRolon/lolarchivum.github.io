However I have since gotten more accustomed to the game and have learnt this is not the case and that essence reaver is an item that only works well on specific champions.\n\nFirstly essence reaver has the benefit of giving mana and cdr to an adc. Now whilst cdr is great, for auto based adcs this benefit isn't exactly amazing, especially when items like maw, ghostblade and blackcleaver are often incorporated into a build situationally and also when many adcs take scaling cdr. Adc's aren't inherently mana inefficient like some mages, with the exception of certain champions like lucian, draven or sivir, so for most the mana back is kinda negligible since most adc's pool of mana will stay sufficient, so long as they don't try to use abilities to clear waves, as so often seen at lower elo.\n\nOn the other hand infinity edges 50% bonus crit damage has a much larger impact on total damage output than you might expect, especially when paired with static shiv and is a far stronger option if you were to try to come out on top of a trade. In the current meta, early damage on adcs is important and trades are often short and based around cooldowns, which means that whilst an essence reaver adc can trade more often than an IE one can, the IE adc will trade better during these short fights and this is worth far more so than a little extra mana sustain. Hence infinity edge is the prefered choice. It is also worth to consider that many adcs have some atk speed or crit modifiers in their kits which can let them hit strong powerspikes after just 1-2 items. In these cases, the early damage is very important in deciding who gets botlane tower first and inevitably moves into the midgame with the advantage.\n\nI hope this explanation helps and isn't too convoluted. Essence reaver is a great item but it's more suited towards ad casters like lucian and ezreal, whereas IE is a great basic item for most adcs and is almost irreplaceable for adcs like caitlynn who have guaranteed crit, or adcs who rush static shiv like vayne.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AngelBird","date":"2017-01-06T23:58:15.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok 1 Essence Reaver and infinity edge both give 70 attack damage and 20 crit.\n\nthat 50% bonus crit damage, is not as large as it sounds.
