LoL Geranimo is the PERFECT example of this. hes a twitch streamer that basically says &quot;Watch me, I will teach you how to get challenger&quot;  Why am I bringing this up? well, He makes like a new account every month just to steam roll anything that moves till he is where he belongs, in the highest possible bracket any one can achieve Why does he need a new account, on top of the possibly hundreds he all ready has.\r\n\r\nHow are we supposed to beat some one like this? who has the game figured out on a molecular level(as far as I can tell).  hes not even a professional, but, for what he is he could very easily be if he wanted too. so, why is this allowed to happen in a competitive game, I can understand like a free for all mode but, this is not free for all.\r\n\r\nIn all likely hood I will stop playing all together. its too frustrating the constant insults and harassment from players you never stood even a remote chance against but, that makes it so much worse, they can&#039;t just leave it at &quot;you have been slain&quot; they have to  make sure you know you are a pathetic degenerate incapable of comprehending a carbon molecule. It never makes sense I wouldn&#039;t mind it so much if I had a similar chance to fight back but, I honestly don&#039;t   me being a stereotype doesn&#039;t help.  everything is made so much worse when your team is right there in the same boat too decides to make you a target of harassment as well.","replies":[{"poster":"kitkatbar","date":"2017-01-04T15:07:50.728+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You built a death cap on Soraka followed by a sheen, and wonder why you got steamrolled?","replies":[{"poster":"AngelBird","date":"2017-01-04T19:09:00.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"...Ok, I was on a team full of bots the most recent game was a bit better but, I had to assemble a role I could help carry with to hopefully counter balance the robot trios.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-01-04T12:51:29.602+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I'm sorry you've had such unpleasant experiences in league :(\n\nBut I give you my word that the game does get better if you keep at it!\n\nPre level 30 can potentially be a rough time I know, because it is the division that has the most variety of skill levels.

I am a dark souls Veteran I am used to dying a lot.\n\nI am still very new, there are so many items and so many rules I have to get used too especially while trying to compete with players that are quite literally worth ten of me.  Its like, if you wanted to learn how to fight so, you picked a fight with some professional MMA dude. so, I see this impossible wall of pain and suffering and I don't want to get to max level.\n\ntruth be told, I do not want to play 1,000 losing games with toxic people that don't understand I barely started and the robot games are a complete joke. I hope what you said is true though, I hope it gets better.
