The New Zealand dollar is worth .96c to an Australian dollar but with RP its only worth about .86c.\n\nFor $100AUD you get 12000RP and for $100NZD you get  10400RP.\nThis is roughly a 14% difference but with the current exchange rates it should only be a 4% difference so it should technically be 11520RP, over 1000RP more than we are currently getting.\n\nNo hate, just woundering why we are getting such a low amount of RP for our money in NZ.","replies":[{"poster":"P1 GTR","date":"2015-01-19T07:18:32.626+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"rekt","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arcanopulse","date":"2015-02-05T04:20:29.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's because prices for RP are a static amount, and exchange rates aren't.\n\nIt would be fairly difficult to code a program that fetches exchange rate data, and calculates that before the RP purchase goes through.\n\nAnd even if that were the case, people would get mad that their friend bought RP last week and got 260 more RP then them because of exchange rates.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarthVrael","date":"2015-01-19T08:35:56.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you look at the payment options for OCE, all but New Zealand option has the rp listed in Australian prices. So I would assume that most of the sales of RP would be collected in AUD.\n\nThe difference in prices would be from both the difference in exchange rate (as you said NZD worth 0.96c AUD) and from the cost of converting that currency to AUD. Although it's more likely that riot doesn't want to have to constantly adjust the price of RP just for NZ so they are just sticking with whatever the rate was when they setup the prices.\n\nIf you think you can get more for your NZD by converting it to AUD, through pay pal or through your bank it might be something to look into so long as the cost of converting isn't too high.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Struggle","date":"2015-01-19T00:22:48.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've noticed this so I go to xe.com figure out how much it's worth then see if I should change currencty to Aus from NZD in shop and make purchase that way.\n\nAt the moment $100Aud is $105Nz.
