So I joined in the game and the moment I tried to move to top lane, I started walking to the enemy nexus and couldn't stop moving unless I pressed S. I walked all the way up to our outer mid turret before I decided to ALT-F4 and when I connected I was back in base and could move freely again. If I didn't do anything I surely would have been executed by the turret or given first blood.\n\nHas anyone had this happen to them before? I have never seen anything like this before.\n\nAlso, I was not lagging at the time this happened a I had 60 ping and could see my allies moving, buying and talking just fine.\n\nEdit: I found a video of what exactly happens from TheOddOne's stream about a month ago.\n         https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6InUrePhrxM","replies":[{"poster":"Zastarx","date":"2014-11-21T18:25:38.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just found this happening to TheOddOne about a month ago, I guess i haven't gone crazy after all!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6InUrePhrxM","replies":[{"poster":"Taliyah","date":"2014-11-21T21:13:38.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"looks weird... odd one like whaaaat when he died","replies":[]}]}]}
