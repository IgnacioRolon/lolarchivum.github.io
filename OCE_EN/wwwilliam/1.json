(More malleability to just do it unofficially)\n\nSo is it possible to keep revising it until it's appropriate for the RP prizes? and not get locked into doing it until approved for RP prizes?","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-12-13T23:49:26.126+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For it to get approved by us you mainly need all the details locked down.
