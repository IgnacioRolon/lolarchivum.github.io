Be a thing BUT!!","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have over 4k games played and more of them are Morde then any other champion and I mained Morde Since 2010 And these recent changes to Morde are devastating, But not for the reasons you may think. Let me explain.\r\n\r\nBot lane Morde can and should be a thing. I&#039;m 100% behind Morde been viable bot lane in fact when I first started playing LoL Morde was a bot lane APC that was his role that was meta (AP bot with support and ADCs went mid). But back then I thought it was stupid to go bot with Morde because his ult was designed to steal ADCs souls and ADCs went mid so I went mid with Morde (And got raged at for it for been so &quot;unmeta&quot;)\r\nMorde thrived on the solo lane EXP so he kinda stayed there while ADCs started going bot, So I&#039;m fine with Morde following ADCs wherever they go. What I&#039;m not fine with is the way it is planned to happen by gutting existing playstyles for no reason.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned Morde thrived on Solo lane EXP so this change:\r\n_[Creeping Death [ W ]\r\n    New Passive: Mordekaiser receives full experience from any lane minion he kills, regardless of lane partners](http://www.newsoflegends.com/index.php/tag/mordekaiser/#9)_\r\nIs nice attempt to keep Morde topped up on EXP in duo lane.\r\nCons are:\r\n-It&#039;s still better EXP to solo lane, Since it wont give him as much EXP as he would get as a solo laner because he will get zoned and pushed out of lane and miss CS (People don&#039;t 100% CS in lane, Specially Melees vs in bot) Unless he gets 100% EXP from all minions it will be fairly mediocre. (Think how many people use EXP runes a little EXP boost doesn&#039;t help that much)\r\n-If you kill someone that is a higher level then you, You get more EXP. So enemy laners will catch up on any slight EXP lead pretty easily if they get a kill.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the Cons it does help Morde to be viable bot and to want to go bot and it&#039;s a good way to encourage players to take him bot because it doesn&#039;t take anything away from solo lane Morde and gives him a nice mechanic to Duo lane Morde, Reason I&#039;m explaining this is because there are good and bad ways to incentivize duo lane Morde.\r\nSuch as:\r\n_New Active - Harvesters of Sorrow: Mordekaiser and target ally champion gain 75 Movement Speed while moving toward one another._\r\nRioter CertaintyT:\r\n[**Harvesters of Sorrow (W) is not castable without an ally champion present.** If you are alone as Mordekaiser, you&#039;ll have to do without it unless an ally ganks/roams for you. ](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/KhcvQBlG-mordekaiser-change-summary-feedback-thread?comment=0002000000000000)\r\nThis is an horrible gut wrenching way to force Morde to go Duo lane. These changes are akin to trying to get kids to do well in school say the EXP boost is like &quot;Hey kids do well I will give you a gold sticker!&quot; which is fine but this change is &quot;LISTEN UP KIDS I STOLE ALL YOUR TOYS AND YOUR NOT GETTING THEM BACK UNTIL YOU DO GOOD AT SCHOOL&quot; But except doing good at school its using your W skill. It&#039;s blackmail and extortion to physically force people to go Duo lane Morde by hurting his solo lane (Which isn&#039;t even OP to begin with) For no discernible reason...\r\n\r\nJust basically deleted his W for solo lanes, W was essential to Surviving ganks and burst dmg (Getting a full combo to your slow moving face that W&#039;s MR can be a lifesaver) and CC with the Armor/MR + Small shield generation, And been able to push the lane and help cs and heal a bit with spell vamp when putting it on a minion from a safe distance, With the movespeed it also helps to escape or chase near minions.\r\nAll that and more is completely gone.\r\n\r\nThen I read on the PBE\r\n_[Siphon of Destruction [ E ]\r\n    Base damage decreased from 70/115/160/205/250 to 35/65/95/125/155](http://www.newsoflegends.com/index.php/tag/mordekaiser/#9)_\r\nI just don&#039;t know anymore... Morde NEEDS his E to poke its his primary form of poke and DMG and it&#039;s dmg is basically cut in half? Level 2 E does less DMG then level 1 E currently and level 1 E currently is pretty bad at poking and trading.\r\nI don&#039;t know how Morde is expected to trade with Cait/Sona with 35 dmg on 5sec CD that damages himself.. (When cait can have 76+ dmg auto attacks level 1)\r\nAnd you Really need the ranged dmg for bot lane and this is Mordes only ranged attack (Since Q is getting reworked into melee only nerfing Mordes ranged dmg even more)\r\n\r\nRiot likes to use the term hidden power, Here are some hidden weaknesses to Morde Bot lane:\r\n-There is no passive that says &quot;Morde must push the lane&quot; but Morde will push the lane, You cannot CS effectively without his AOE spells and you need to generate a shield with AOE spells to trade.\r\n-Bot lane is a longer lane then mid so pushing the lane makes your more susceptible to ganks. (Top Morde has his level advantage over the JG to compensate) and Mid lane you can reset the waves by pushing into tower a easier because it&#039;s a shorter lane which is hugely important to countering a lot of champions mid as Morde (With certain champions you if you can&#039;t fight them you need to push the wave into the tower to mess with there CSing then let the minions reset asap)\r\nNow if you want to do that bot it&#039;s a longer lane so it&#039;s going to take more time to push the wave into the tower, ADC&#039;s are generally better at CSing under tower, It&#039;s going to take the wave longer to get back into the middle of the lane in bot lane, All hidden disadvantages to Morde bot.\r\n\r\nBut I really feel gut wrenched and astonished when I read some things (no offense) CertainlyT says: &quot;_**[Morde is still able to solo lane/jungle in our testing](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/KhcvQBlG-mordekaiser-change-summary-feedback-thread?comment=0002000000000000)**_&quot; 1. Morde doesn&#039;t and shouldn&#039;t jungle 2. Removing W from Morde kills his clear speed and survivability. Who is doing this testing and how can they think Morde can jungle, without his W.... I feel like this is a bad dream.\r\n\r\nThere are a billion other things I could criticize and complain about how things could be done better in a million different ways I literally could go on for days and would be more then willing to do so if Riot wanted to listen.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR:** Morde should have changes to be Viable in a Duo lane, These are not the nerfs/changes he needs\r\n\r\nLinks on the changes:\r\nAnnounced changes http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/gameplay-update-juggernauts\r\nPBE Stat changes http://www.newsoflegends.com/index.php/tag/mordekaiser/#9\r\nPBE Riot posts about changes http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/KhcvQBlG-mordekaiser-change-summary-feedback-thread","replies":[{"poster":"Quizmar","date":"2015-08-06T02:06:27.645+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, as a Morde player, these changes are pretty offensive.

If we want to take a champ you love and shit all over it in an attempt to be creative and experimental (which never ends well ala Bard) we will because we dont design champs FOR you, we design them DESPITE you.\"\n\nThey say they are making these changes to give him clear weaknesses, but the only change they've made to actually give a weakness is FORCE him bot lane aka deal with being pummeled by ranged AAs, which is a joke. \n\nDo I think it's cool that they're trying to make meta a little more flexible?

Which hurts duo bot lane Morde a lot.\n\nSimply APC duo bot lane Morde with a self castable W > APC duo bot lane Morde without a self castable W.\n\nAgain I think Morde can very easily be worked into bot lane (Without unnecessarily killing his solo lane) and should be, But his kit needs to be able to handle things like Cait/Sona Graves/Blitz which he can't early game. His Poke/trading which is basically his E has his damage nerfed and costs health to do so trading with that is gonna be super hard.\n\nNot to mention things like bot lane generally has bad wave clear (unlike top/mid who generally have some AOE to reset waves quicker) bot will sit under tower and farm from safety with ranged autos all day while morde continues to push. Then when his slow ass gets ganked with 0 CC and only a situational slight movement speed his weak early game damage to save him it's not going to end well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NightWraithes","date":"2015-08-06T00:32:38.377+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, these changes make me sad as I really love playing Morde.

The E damage nerf will make it hard for him to do damage and the Ability of Mordekaiser to burst someone is completely made impossible with this PBE changes.

His Q nerf wouldn't be too much of a problem if you have these two items especially now that Q applies spellvamp fully since it is no longer an Aoe spell but the E nerfs though really makes it hard for Mordekaiser to waveclear making it hard to play him as a solo laner.
