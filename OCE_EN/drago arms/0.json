I was thinking of how the problem could be addressed and thought that if the player was replaced by a bot then they could still be able to hold their lane, the only problem would be that bots usually die relatively easily, don't respond to pings and don't help in team fights. The solution for this could be a new styled AI, defensive, sits underneath turrets and focuses minions, if the turret is destroyed it'd retreat to the next turret. THE BOT COULD NOT BE OFFENSIVE also a precaution to stop the easy feeding that the bot might provide the enemy team, kill gold might be halved (from killing the bot) the bot could buy items from the recommended items list. If a player returned, they would assume control of the bot just as if a player left, the bot would assume control of their current character.\r\n\r\nThis is quite a large idea as i understand that there is an enormous amount of work involved in just the new AI however it could help assuage the burden an AFK person has on their 'team'.   {{champion:115}} \r\n\r\n{{item:3157}} Waiting on responses. ]#\r\n\r\nPs.

But Leaver Buster takes into account all of your leave history, and to have received a low priority queue punishment your leaver history would have been higher than the threshold.\n\nAlthough 10 min queue for 5 matches isn't the worst I have seen =P\n\nRemember \"Whether a player DCs or intentionally leaves, it's still a ruined experience for 4 to 9 other players in the game. Although it isn't the player's \"fault\" when they unintentionally DC, it's even more unfair to penalize up to 9 players per game while a player figures out their connection issues.\n\nIf you DC from the game because of League of Legends server stability, Leaverbuster won't affect you and won't count those games.

Here is the scenario: The game used to work fine until riot were just about to release patch 5.1 and all of a sudden lots of players started experiencing firewall error. \n\nRiot officially admitted this: http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/zgUdmTen-firewall-errorblack-screen-after-champion-select?comment=0008\n\nI spoke to my ISP and there said players from other ISP's experiencing the same issue just before the patch 5.1 release and after the patch 5.1 release.  I hardly think this is a coincidence and i don't think suddenly and magically evil Satan decided to create the firewall error :P. :)\n\n\nOn top that, Riot has to take responsibility to help out players who have already tried all the solutions and give proof that they can't connect due to a legit firewall error. Riot has to practice HONESTY, which they rarely do since it is too much a hassle to fix the broken system. Players who have lost ranked  cause of the firewall error should in the least get acknowledged and after the player provides proof, they should be compensated by giving them a draw in the ranked system. The opponents can still have their wins. This provides a positive environment for every player and they would be motivated to spend more time on playing ranked. Riot now ranked is just a lottery system, unless your are a diamond players playing on smurf and can 1 vs 5 the enemy team. \n\nOn the other hand, Riot can continue their Hitler policy and kill players out mercilessly with their new broken leaver buster system and their new \"automatic robotic ban system\". The players say \" damn %%%%ing suck so bad and  %%%%%%ed moves\" and the computer takes \"%%%%\", \"suck\", \"damn\", \"%%%%%%ed\" and \"bad\" = toxic in computer algorithm =  ban. While the player might be referring to his bad plays with the above statement, the computer still think that player is toxic. I have seen many people/kids use that kind of language on themselves and on others in a not offensive way. The worst think about this system is that the computer don't understand the tone u r talking,  while u may be sarcastic or it was just a joke and everyone team knows it is a joke and laugh with you but the computer think you are toxic :(.\n\nI play many online games, I play  destiny which needs a lot of resources to run the game efficiently like excellent internet connection/speed, high computer specs etc and I have never experienced a lag or disconnection issues. Same goes for every other game I play online. When it comes to league of legends, there is always some issue going on, either for me or my team mates.

That doesn't fix the 4 v 5 situation.\n\nOnce again I think it's great you're trying to solve the negative experience that arises from AFKs/leavers. First we should think about why is the 4v5 experience so bad, it might seem obvious but it helps to break it down.\n\nIn my opinion right now there are two main factors affecting the experience of the 4 man team:\n1. They are a man down and will most likely lose (the obvious factor)\n2. It's out of their control\n3. They have to \"waste\" time playing out till 20 minutes or defeat, which ever comes first\n\nSo lets say those are the 3 main problems, and maybe you can let me know if there's more, what can we do to solve these issues.\nI see you have clearly identified issue 1. so you mentioned adding in a bot to defend turrets (essentially buffing a turret). I don't think this will change the fact that they are a man down and will most likely lose.\n\nFixing 1. is quite hard, and there is no real good solution for it that I can think of. Sub in another player? (do players want to join a 4v5 to make it 5v5, what if he cant play that champion? what if the player that dced reconnects). Add a bot, A bot will never be as good at reacting to situations as people (for now at least).\n\ncan we fix 2.? I don't think we can put DC's/leavers in their control\n\ncan we fix 3.? I think maybe there is something that could be done here. DC's/leavers give a bad experience to us we hate playing 4v5s. We can't stop people from dc/leaving and we probably can't find a way to change the 4v5 back to a 5v5 after a dc/leaver.\n\nBut what about that feeling of being \"trapped\" and \"wasting\" time on a lost cause. Is there something that can be done there?\n\nThe **community** has had many suggestions like;\n* mercy vote - other team can vote to give mercy, effectively voiding the game and treating it like a normal game\n* earlier surrender time - if there is a dc/leaver maybe you can dc at 10/15 minutes rather than 20\n* Reduced LP/MMR loss - the 4 man team would lose a lot less MMR/LP while the dc/leaver loses a lot more\n\nAll of the above are interesting suggestions and need to have more thought put into them but I am interested in hearing your thoughts on this.","replies":[{"poster":"Drago arms","date":"2015-01-16T13:47:31.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the comprehensive response. The defensive bot would (in a way) act as a buff on the turret but it would give the other people on the team the needed 'home-ground' defence to enable them to push their own turrets and not have to worry about getting backdoor'd down the one unprotected lane. Or let's say that they sacrifice one player from any of the other roles in the game to cover that lane, it's still a tactical disadvantage to the team. The bot would just be a little bit more menacing to any enemy that tries to push the afk'ed lane. thanks for the feedback :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Yuriklatura","date":"2015-01-15T07:23:37.681+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A better solution would be for the remaining team members to gain a straight up 40% bonus to all stats except for attack damage and ability power, which gain only 10% bonus.
