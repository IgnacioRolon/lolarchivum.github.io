Quote from the [Riot Support Page on Hextech Crafting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide): _Activate a shard to “rent” a champion for 7 days. This does consume the shard, so you won't be able to use it again until you find another.\n_\n\nRegards,\nPRIMAL","replies":[]}]}
