{"poster":"Awkward","date":"2015-09-30T14:54:57.779+0000","title":"IP Sink.","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi.\r\n\r\nNot-so recently I&#039;ve managed to acquire pretty much everything I&#039;ve ever needed with IP. Runes, Rune Pages, Champs, Name Changes, you name it, but I&#039;m still sitting at around ~40k IP with nothing to spend it on. When a new champ comes out, I basically but it instantly and generate far more than the 7600 or so IP it costs to buy a brand new champ in the time it takes for someone new to come out.\r\n\r\nSo though it&#039;s probably been suggested a few times before, I&#039;d like to make some suggestions for a more long term IP sink. These would naturally be pretty inefficient to make them less attractive than other IP sinks.\r\n\r\n_**IP to RP conversion.**_\r\n\r\nPretty obvious. At a rate of say 5k IP to 100 RP, this would mean I could sink my 40k IP into around 800 RP which I think would be reasonable. A 975 skin would cost 50k IP, a 1350 70k IP, an 1820 skin would cost 95k and an ultimate Skin like DJ Sona would cost 165k IP.\r\n\r\nSince this would be the most useful one, I made it the least efficient method.\r\n\r\n_**IP/Skin Boosts**_\r\n\r\nBasically this would work like the Skin Boost you get from ARAM, except it&#039;d cost around ~500-1k IP and gives a boost to IP generation for other teammates and unlocks a skin for the chosen champion for that match (including the person who bought the boost), but the person who bought the boost would generate ZERO IP for that match.\r\n\r\n_**IP Gifting**_\r\n\r\nA lot of people, including myself have people we know RL or through other means who are new to the game. They see something cool and want it, especially champs, but it&#039;d cost too much IP for them to get normally and they&#039;re pretty hesitant to actually spent RP on it.\r\n\r\nAt an increased cost ofc, it&#039;d be nice if we could gift things to friends (or smurfs, or w.e.) that normally cost IP. Champs, Runes and XP/IP boosts come to mind here, so we could give a friend who is new to the game a 10 game IP/XP boost for say 5k IP or whatever, and make getting into it a little less painful, especially when they have to buy the runes.\r\n\r\n_**Cosmetic Rewards**_\r\n\r\nSome of the Summoner Icons Rito makes are rad. I&#039;m using the Project Leona one and it is dope. What was less dope was having to buy it with RP. It&#039;d be nice if we could buy things like Summoner Icons, Loading Screen Borders, or art for that little splashart doohicker on your Champion Info (you know the one, it changes if you have the icon for an Ultimate Skin).\r\n\r\nSay 3k for an Icon like Project Leona, 10/15k for something that changes the splashart border thingy, and 50k for something big like a loading screen border (that would be made distinguishable from the ranked ones).\r\n\r\n_**Conclusion**_\r\n\r\nSo there&#039;s some ideas. I&#039;ll put in a poll thingy to see what people like and if you have any ideas, or other comments, please uh...comment. Though be gentle, it&#039;s my first post.","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-09-30T15:04:45.314+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say timed cosmetics because we know looking good is more important than anything else.\n\nIf you see a guy without skin you need to report him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2015-10-01T02:40:22.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing with IP to RP conversion is that on the off chance that Riot ever made such a thing, it would have an incredibly low conversion rate. Perhaps if it was a chance system based off High Risk-High Reward. i.e. Spend 10k IP and potentially get 100 RP or 1000 RP. On the other end of the spectrum, you could go for a measly 1k IP and get a safe amount of RP.\n\nCosmetic rewards would be the most likely IP sink, though, if Riot were to even make one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2015-10-01T02:32:53.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cosmetic rewards is the most realistic.
