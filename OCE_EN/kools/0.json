Not sure what the deal is but if I wanted to play bots I would select that game type.","replies":[{"poster":"darr","date":"2015-11-10T09:38:26.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really that shocking when you see how much gold and plat accounts sell for OCE servers","replies":[]},{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2015-11-10T08:57:50.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if they remove the exp gain in ARAM?\n\nIt would likely initially force them to bot in Summoners Rift, sure.\n\nBut when they realize that nobody wants to buy a level 30 account with a 5% win rate and a negative MMR, it may stop","replies":[]},{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-11-10T07:11:09.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{summoner:6}} {{summoner:32}}  = bots in Aram.
