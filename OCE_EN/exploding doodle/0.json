After playing the game and being ahead of everyone except my friend. We still lose except it wasn&#039;t even my fault, in fact I cam back in and did better than most of my team. After I get back to the client, it gives me a leaver buster and i don&#039;t think that is fair. If riot can base their leaver busters by how long the people have left the match then that would be better. say if someone leaves the game for more than half the match. THEN they would get the leaver buster. Pls Riot, pls fix this.\r\n{{item:3070}} evry tim.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-11T07:05:57.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nLeaverbuster _is_ based on how long you leave a game for, however I'm not sure of the exact time it is based on (From my experience, around 5 minutes).\n\nYou also do not normally receive any form of punishment after leaving one game, it takes multiple instances for a punishment to trigger, however ranked leaves are treated more serious by the system.\n\nFor mroe information on the Leaverbuster system please see the [Leaverbuster FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ).","replies":[]}]}
