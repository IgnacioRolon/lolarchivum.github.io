We detected that you&#039;ve recently played from a computer running Windows XP, so we wanted to give you a warning ping in case you needed to upgrade to Service Pack 3 or a newer operating system. Otherwise, League of Legends may fail to run on your machine.\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;ve already upgraded to Service Pack 3, you&#039;re in the clear for now. That said, we recommend looking into upgrading off of XP anyway to keep your computer -- and your League account -- secure. Check the support article for information on how to upgrade: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/210106803\r\n\r\nTo find out what service pack you&#039;re running, follow the steps outlined here: https://answers.msn.com/solution.aspx?solutionid=23904a8f-735b-40f9-b609-544b95a5729b\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI find it rather interesting because i have not used windows XP since season 2.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-28T08:52:43.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThey're probably just sending out a general email to everyone who's logged onto league in the past from an XP machine, just in case you still have a machine that runs XP.","replies":[]}]}
