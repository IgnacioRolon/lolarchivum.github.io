This is one of our most complex FGMs to date, with multiple mechanics and a treasure trove of new content to absorb. So buckle in and let&rsquo;s break it down.\r\n\r\nBlack Market Brawlers\r\nTL;DR: Purchase illegal Black Market items and use golden Krakens to recruit new brawler minions as you vie for dominance on Summoner&rsquo;s Rift!\r\n\r\nPlayers: 5v5\r\nMap: Summoner&rsquo;s Rift\r\nPick type: Blind Draft\r\n\r\nKrakens\r\n\r\nGolden Krakens are a new currency you&rsquo;ll earn to spend on hiring and upgrading your brawler minion.\r\nEarn and spend Krakens to hire the brawler minion of your choice, then upgrade them however you want.\r\nKrakens are acquired by:\r\n-- Every 60sec = 1 Kraken\r\n-- 1 kill = 2 Krakens\r\n-- 1 assist = 1 Kraken\r\n-- Baron/Dragon = 1 Kraken per team member (5 total)\r\n-- Counter jungling a large monster = 1 Kraken\r\n\r\nDestroying an inhibitor won&rsquo;t summon a Siege Minion but instead, dramatically buff all the Brawlers in that lane.\r\n\r\nThe Brawlers:\r\nThere are four types of brawler minions. Each game you will spend Krakens you&rsquo;ve earned to hire one brawler minion type of your choice, then upgrade him as you see fit throughout the game. Once hired, your brawler will replace a regular minion and spawn in every wave of all 3 lanes for the rest of the game. Each brawler minion has 3 upgrade paths (Abilities, Attack &amp; Defense) you can pursue to customise them how you want. Upgrades can be purchased from the new &ldquo;Brawlers&rdquo; tab in the item shop at fountain using Krakens.\r\n\r\n\r\nIronbacks\r\n\r\nMelee: Tanky siege\r\n\r\nInitial hire: Your Ironback takes 25% reduced dmg from enemy turrets.\r\nLv 1: Your Ironback deals 175% dmg to enemy structures. Gains a shield that blocks the next basic attack from a champion or a turret. (Shield CD 10sec)\r\nLv 2: Your Ironback deals 250% dmg to enemy structures. While the shield is active, it takes 35% reduced dmg from minions.\r\nLv 3: Your Ironback deals 325% dmg to enemy structures. The shield CD is reduced to 3sec and it now takes 60% reduced dmg from minions.\r\n\r\n\r\nRazorfins\r\n\r\nMelee: Champion pursuer\r\n\r\nInitial hire: Your Razorfin has 100% bonus attack speed.\r\nLv 1: Upon aggroing an enemy champion, it will pursue them endlessly. While attacking enemy champions your Razorfin has 100% increased movement speed and ignores unit collision.\r\nLv 2: Each time your Razorfin hits an enemy champion, it applies a mark. On the 3rd mark, Razorfins deal 300% damage to the target.\r\nLv 3: Two Razorfins will spawn for you in each wave.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlundercrabs\r\n\r\nRanged: Champion harass\r\n\r\nInitial hire: Your Plundercrab shoots an additional shot at a nearby champion with +150 attack range but 50% damage.\r\nLv 1: Your Plundercrab has +50 attack range. Gains a stacking 20% attack speed buff (up to 150%) for 3sec every time they hit an enemy champion.\r\nLv 2: Your Plundercrab has +100 attack range. Deals 150% dmg on hitting enemy champions.\r\nLv 3: Your Plundercrab has +150 attack range. On-hit bonus now also applies when hitting enemy minions, and shoots an additional shot at ALL nearby enemy champions.\r\n\r\n\r\nOcklepods\r\n\r\nRanged: Support utility\r\n\r\nInitial hire: Your Ocklepod casts a magic shield on allied minions every 10sec, blocking 80 dmg. The shield lasts 10sec.\r\nLv 1: Your Ocklepod has 10 MR. Spawns a moving Clairvoyance every 30sec.

Shield now blocks 300 + (1 x Ocklepod&#039;s AD) damage.\r\n\r\nOther Brawler upgrades:\r\nBrawler Abilities\r\n\r\nAdds an ability to your brawler. Each brawler minion has different abilities unique to them (Total 3). See above for detailed descriptions of each brawler&rsquo;s unique ability upgrades.\r\nInitial hire (5 Krakens): See above\r\nLv 1 (5 Krakens): See above.\r\nLv 2 (10 Krakens): See above.\r\nLv 3 (20 Krakens): See above.\r\n\r\nBrawler Attack\r\n\r\nAdds AD to your Brawler (Total 3).\r\nLv 1 (5 Krakens): +10 AD (Total +10 AD)\r\nLv 2 (10 Krakens): +20 AD (Total +30 AD)\r\nLv 3 (20 Krakens): +30 AD (Total +60 AD)\r\n\r\nBrawler Defense\r\n\r\nAdds extra HP to your Brawler (Total 3).\r\nLv 1 (5 Krakens): +100 HP (Total +100 HP)\r\nLv 2 (10 Krakens): +200 HP (Total +300 HP)\r\nLv 3 (20 Krakens): +300 HP (Total +600 HP)\r\n\r\nItems\r\nAs well as the new brawler minions, there&rsquo;s also a cache of new illicit Black Market items in the mix on this featured game mode.

Working on it!\r\n\r\nWe&rsquo;re looking forward to seeing the outcomes of a mode as deep as this one. Do you hire brawler minions that enhance your team&rsquo;s strengths (&quot;Let&rsquo;s get some Ironbacks so we can siege down towers!&quot;) or exploit the enemy team&rsquo;s weaknesses (&quot;they have terrible wave clear.. Razorfin rush!&quot;). The Black Market items will also completely change champ viability for multiple roles. I&rsquo;m sure you guys will find crazy new combos/synergy that we haven&rsquo;t even thought of! o.O\r\n\r\nPlease report any bugs you find in here. As always, thanks for helping us test PBE guys. ^_^\r\n\r\n-L4T3NCY\r\nl\r\nHi here&#039;s my first question\r\n\r\n1. When will this be released? I know this has nothing to do with the actual game mode but I&#039;m just curious =D\r\n\r\n2. How long will it be out for? Ok none of these questions have anything to do with the actual game mode but again I&#039;m curious\r\n\r\nBonus question. I don&#039;t see why this is a bonus question but I&#039;m asking it anyway what level do you have to be to play it ok I&#039;m level 30 but I&#039;m sure other players might want to know\r\n\r\nsincerely sneezee Oce","replies":[{"poster":"sneezee","date":"2015-07-09T09:02:11.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok thanks for the estimates I hope you have fun playing this game mode","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-07-09T10:39:31.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeh, it looks interesting.

Featured game modes usually aren't on PBE for long, if at all, before going live.\n\n> How long will it be out for?\n\n1-2 weeks probably. That's how long featured game modes usually last.\n\n> what level do you have to be to play it\n\nLevel 10 is the standard for featured game modes if I remember correctly.","replies":[]}]}
