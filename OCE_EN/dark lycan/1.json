When finishing a normals game your status remains as &quot;In Game&quot; even though you are not. It does not change back with time (waited 30 Min) although everyone in my friends list still have their statuses change the second they finish their games.","replies":[{"poster":"Darkrai of time","date":"2016-05-20T21:48:11.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got that once. said i was in a game for 165 minutes lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gloomy1st","date":"2016-05-19T18:09:43.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah ï¼Œme too","replies":[]},{"poster":"Caress of Venus","date":"2016-05-19T07:47:19.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got that as well as not moving back to main client screen, I was bugged out on \"Game is still in progress\" screen for 5-10 minutes before I shut the client down.\n\nSubmitted bug report.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDeathlyCow","date":"2016-05-19T06:39:00.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea i got that too","replies":[]}]}
