I was hoping to get some feedback from the community.\r\n\r\nI have been using OBS and Plays.tv to record so far and being doing the editing through Windows Movie Maker, which shows in the editing. But I wanted to get a hang of it all before investing in something like Adobe Premiere or Sony Vegas.\r\n\r\nIf you guys have any comments or criticism of my videos I would love to hear it and any suggestions on software I would really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nCheers \r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-04-24T08:51:30.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Joeru,\n\nI'm a long time YouTube user (since late 2007), and I've also managed a music channel myself that's at around 12,000 subscribers currently. So I don't know everything, but I understand the basics with YouTube.\n\nI'm also assuming you're semi-serious about YouTube and want to build a solid fan base. If you just want a place to release content, and don't care about anything else, then a lot of this might not be relevant.\n\nAnd lastly, if you need any help with doing some of this add me on Discord at Tele#0343 and I'd be happy to help out :D\n\nHere's a few things easy things you can fix now:\n\n+ **Change the channel format**\n [This](https://i.gyazo.com/99f22eb7ddc07ff5d225af05d36cd0e1.png) is what your channel looks like right now. [Here](https://i.gyazo.com/5130b4bf39d35ce5154d0cc3d2019e2c.png) is Calbel's (who's similar to you) layout. \n\n Notice that Calbel's channel has an intro video. _You need one of those._ Maybe someone has come by your channel to see what other content you have. The intro video is a really great chance to put up your best video that will appeal to the most people, and hopefully get them to subscribe as a result.\n\n  You also don't have tabs at the top for _\"videos\"_, _\"playlists\"_ etc. The last thing you need is people getting confused on about where they can find more videos on your channel. I strongly recommend using the layout Calbel and everyone else uses.\n\n\n+ **Ending Card/Outro Clip**\n It's actually very rare for someone to watch your whole video right to the end. But when that happens you know they probably really enjoyed your content. This is where you need an outro clip to get them to watch more videos!\n\n Here you've got to be careful. If you just slap something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5u5wyXT1jA) on the end of your videos, you'll probably get a lot of hate and it won't help much.\n\n For beginners I recommend just going for something basic. [Tyler1's outro clip](https://i.gyazo.com/76fb75e1d60b44f7147793870d820d3d.png) is a great example. It's just his favorite champion with some videos and a reminder to subscribe. I recommend you do something similar.\n\n+ **Thumbnails**\n Thumbnails are probably overrated, but that doesn't mean they aren't important. \n\n Here's my 3 rules for thumbnails:\n + Don't clickbait, but make sure it's interesting in some way. Maybe leave a screenshot of you chunking someone as AP Bard.\n + Really big text, and use the meme font unless you know what you're doing.\n + Make it relevant to the video. I should have a rough idea about what the video will be from JUST the thumbnail.\n\n You're doing ok with them so far. The thumbnails on your AP Bard and Rakan videos are decent/good. Stay away from thumbnails like your Coffee Vlog thumbnail or League Best Of Moments Thumbnail.\n\nHere's a few things to work on later:\n\n+ **Unique**\n The key to YouTube is making sure your content provides something unique.\n\n If I put a Brofresco video on mute, it's almost identical to an Anklespankin video on mute. What makes those channels unique isn't actually the video, it's their voice and personality.\n\n I know you already have a few videos where you're in call with friends or talking, so you're already halfway there. Just make sure you keep working at it. Video's like your _\"WTF Warlock\"_ are great! Sure you're not on NB3's level yet, but it's decent, and definitely more entertaining than nothing.\n\n\n+ **Software**\n Honestly what you have now is fine, and needlessly upgrading is a waste of time. Generally it's time to upgrade when you want to do something with your video but your Software won't let you do it.\n\n But with that said, I would recommend SonyVegas 13. It's easy to use, but still has professional features (color correction, green screen etc.).\n\n\n+ **Monkey see, monkey do**\n I know I just said to be unique, but when you're starting out you should be adapting things from other channels to give you a good starting point. Then overtime you'll innovate and have your own style.\n\n For example, go watch your [AP Bard montage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2LdGYJxCPI), and then watch [Kshaway's AP Bard montage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibc3vnSJUBQ). I'm sure immediately you can see things that you could add to yours, music choice, comedic zooms, memes etc.\n\n Learn to do that process with ALL your videos. It's the fastest way to improve your content.\n\nThat's a basic rundown. I've left out a lot of stuff for the sake of time like  tags, upload times etc. So if you're interested in knowing a bit more, feel free to contact me on discord.\n\nGood luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Joeru","date":"2017-04-24T10:50:55.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, thank you so much for the in depth advice. I am so grateful to the effort you put into this post and that you took the time to research my videos and do the comparisons it means a lot. I have added you on discord also, I would love the extra advice but also just to say a big thank you.\n\nI find my biggest problem with getting me into the videos is I become really subdued when I start recording myself. I am a teacher and spend all day entertaining a class of 30 kids, but for some reason the camera just mutes my personality. This may be because I play games to relax, but I really need to find a way to bring out my teacher personality into my videos. \n\nI like to think I have a decent sense of humour, which I have only been able to do through the basic editing tools I have access to. E.g. Today's Fiery Bat video. \n\nAnyways I will definitely take this advice to heart and try to keep improving my content. \n\nLong term I want to get my editing skills up enough to make a second channel for educational stuff, so hopefully this experience will help with that.\n\nCheers again mate ^_^","replies":[]}]}]}
