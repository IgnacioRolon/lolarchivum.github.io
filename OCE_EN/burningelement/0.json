I was in champion select. I was playing normally waiting for my pick to come and when the enemy team had 15 seconds to pick before my turn they randomly locked me in and said it was our turn to choose... Jayce was somehow locked in also (on the enemy team) but our last pick was able to pick. Like wtf? What if I was in promos or something. So yeah I got kicked out of the queue and it said I have to wait 30 minutes until I could get back into queue again. Please riot, fix this before people start having rages :c.... BTW Picture for proof, showing me locked in without even picking a champion. (Sorry for the blue line, it was an accident and there was no undo button :c)","replies":[{"poster":"Mothy50","date":"2015-01-10T11:04:11.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can clarify that there was no way of selecting a champion. From memory, I think someone may have switched their choice in champions at the very last second and they may be a cause of it.\n\nAlso, lost my first game in my promo series cause of this :(","replies":[]}]}
