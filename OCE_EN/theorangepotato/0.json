So i went to check on [oce.op.gg](http://oce.op.gg) and it says I&#039;ve played 6 games. 2 win 4 loss (I know, I&#039;m a noob XD). BUT THEN I went to check on [lolking](http://www.lolking.com) and it says 7 games played, 2 win 5 loss** (WHAT!!)**. i then clicked on ranked stats on lolking and there were only 6 tabs (Rumble, Jayce, Lee Sin, Ezreal, Riven, Lucian).

If it's been recorded as a null game, then it won't contribute towards your final placement (ie. you only had to play nine provisionals instead of ten). If you really want to, you can make a [support ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new) and see if the red can set things straight.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
