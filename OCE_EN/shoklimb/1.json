Why the hell is revive being removed from the game. Why because noone uses it. Well theres a reason for that it's UP, now if riot is scared of the toxic implications of buffing it just look at ga, zac, aatrox and anivia. They all have the idea of reviving a character and very rarely complained about because their revive was toxic to the the game.\r\n\r\nNow the main reason I'm annoyed about this is the fun you can have revive. All revive tele mid, revive tele Karthus, move speed Hecarim and these gimmicks while not oftenly played are extremely fun to play. \r\n\r\nYou are seriously just removing revive and all these builds away because revive is 'rarely' used. May I remind you that this is encouraging play with the meta sumoner spells, builds and team comps.\r\n\r\nPlease don't remove revive rito, please just don't\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Rito shouldn't remove revive","replies":[{"poster":"Best Viktor AU","date":"2015-02-25T09:26:13.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIP Zombie Karthus you will be missed. {{champion:30}} {{summoner:10}} {{summoner:12}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynamax","date":"2015-02-25T08:13:10.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't get it, trolling with revive... I can take anyone summoner spells and troll, removing revive doesn't stop trolls at all, if that's their reasoning. They will probs just take cleanse cv, ezpz.\n\nI think the few positives outweigh the few negatives.

Like, just have an option for certain categories of deleted stuff, for when you just wanna have fun with people without it being serious competition.","replies":[]},{"poster":"idc","date":"2015-02-25T05:01:16.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good.
