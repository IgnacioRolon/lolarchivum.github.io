I know that the last to numbers are representing seconds but how do I read this number and instantly know that it&#039;s been 5 minutes or 30 minutes. I prefer to watch games that are close to fresh as possible so I can see how certain people play a champ and get a rough idea for the way to build early and such.\r\nIt&#039;s really starting to annoy me that the time seems so random and large, does anyone know why?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-18T08:46:02.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The 'spectate now' feature is actually completely broken for a lot of people.
