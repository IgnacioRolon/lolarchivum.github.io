No matter about patch 5.8 so I&#039;m wondering if you guys have actually come up with a Solution to this. I cannot close the Client since when I do and reopen it, it does the Infinite scan loop again.\r\nI just got back into League in February after having the Infinite loop get annoying and tedious. Have you seriously NOT come up with a solution to this problem yet? It&#039;s NOT new it&#039;s old. Same with the freezing patch part.\r\n\r\nDo I seriously have to re-download the ENTIRE game every couple of patches?\r\nLooking for an actual solid Solution... None of this stuff I&#039;ve already tried, because it is clearly NOT working. Re-installing the whole game I did when I got back into League and look how that&#039;s turned out...","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-01T09:52:08.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried running in admin mode?\n\nHave you tried refreshing your connection while it's loading? What you do is load the patcher until it gets to the point in which it freezes, then you disconnect your internet source for ten seconds, and then reconnect. Wait around five minutes, and it should start downloading again.\n\nIf it doesn't work, please get back to me.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}
