Just to get the feel of him. I tried to kill baron got to 20% HP and left. Then E&#039;ed the Scuttle (Jungle mob) behind me and 1 shot it (100% HP to 0%) with just the E dash auto attack. Then went and tried to do it on the other one and barely scratched it with my E.

Do me a favour and next time you try Ekko build Sorc's + Alacrity (Distortion if you're playing him Top with TP), Rabadon's (GA if you're playing him Top), Zhonya's, Lich Bane, Morello's, Void Staff.\n\nAll you really need as Ekko is CDR, Magic Pen and Survive-ability and Lich Bane just makes for nice compound burst to single targets.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hop Thief","date":"2015-05-29T07:00:34.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe its something to do with his passive - Z Drive resonance.
