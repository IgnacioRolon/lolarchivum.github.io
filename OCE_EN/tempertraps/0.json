I saw I had 3, two of which I didn&#039;t want, so I rerolled... thinking I&#039;d use the orange shards to craft Nunu. Well... I used Zombie Nunu in the reroll! Tried submitting a support ticket, but it wouldn&#039;t let me. Can this be reverted? Even if I only get the Nunu skin back? Happy to cop the loss of the other 2, and whatever skin I unlocked (cause I was too shocked at what I&#039;d done to check what I even got out of it... I know it wasn&#039;t Zombie Nunu!). Riot plz :P","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-06-22T05:09:21.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The login for the support page and the website (boards) are separate. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/IrSBuzi.png?noredirect\n\nThere are currently issues with the login transition preventing players from easily logging into support. There are two current workarounds:\n\n1. Open the support page in an incognito/private window and follow the process as normal, pressing the login button when prompted.\n\n2. Log out of the website **from the support page**, and then follow the process as normal, pressing login when prompted.\n\nIf your support page has the blank \"OC\" login in the top right, you're good to go. If it only has your summoner icon with \"OCEANIA\" it means the support page is seeing you as logged in on the website and not in support. You need to follow one of the steps above.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2018-07-04T05:45:55.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Additionally, when all else fails, you can always submit a ticket via email by shooting your request to support@riotgames.com.
