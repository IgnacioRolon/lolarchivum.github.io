When this happens though the LoL Patcher will stop and won&#039;t start again after my laptop reconnects with the internet.  So since i need to download 3 gig in total, I cant download the game.  Restarting the launcher after i reset the internet connection takes me back to the start of the download since it doesn&#039;t save the files.  \r\n\r\nAnyone know of anyway I can get around this? pausing the patcher, downloading the game in less than 2gig files, torrent?\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-19T11:04:09.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dunno what happens with the new patcher, man. I know that the old one would just download files directly into the directories, and if it was interrupted then the next time it starts it would scan for all the files it downloaded and resume from there. What the new patcher (maybe) doing is downloading the files as \"temp\" files (which are in unreadable, compressed format, mind you) which it then decompresses **after the rest of the files have finished downloading** and not while the unrelated ones are downloading. If the patcher closes or stops for any reason, all compressed files are removed. Really makes me wonder why the patcher needs to \"scan\" for files if that was the plan to begin with.\n\ntl dr; It takes a while and there's no way to \"resume\" a download.\n\nWhat you can do is get a copy of the game off of a friend and just plop the contents of that into your game files. All you need are the files inside \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\". If you want the easy method, just copy all the folders from there and put them in the same place on your system. If you want to not use your friend's settings and item sets, then be sure to remove all stored preferences from \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases\\0.0.1.140\\deploy\\preferences\", where the release number matches with the version you copied over.\n\nIf you need any clarity on those instructions, just ask!\n\n*P.S: You really shouldn't use torrents or FTP downloads to get League. Ignoring the fact that it's the easiest way to get a virus or malware onto your computer, it's most likely not going to be the most current version (causing League to download most of the files anyway) and neither is it likely going to be for the correct region (meaning you basically get nothing).*","replies":[]},{"poster":"SumCoolAid","date":"2015-04-19T09:13:41.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"An interesting problem, the patcher can resume at certain points of the download but it seems you're not registering these points. The easy solution would be to go to a friends house and download it. AFAIK there is no direct download to the client anymore. Ill investigate and get back.","replies":[]}]}
