She buried her face in the pillow and groaned, trying to ignore the obnoxious alarm still ringing.\r\n\r\nShe had barely any sleep after spending most of the previous night chasing the local mushroom thief and she still had the itching rashes from chasing him. Then on top of that there were the daily summons that started before sunrise.\r\n\r\nNo point putting it off, she sighed into her pillow, summons waited for no-one.\r\n\r\nRealising she was already late, Caitlyn threw off the covers and hastily dressed as she rushed about her dark room, almost tripping over her chair. Grabbing her rifle and hat off the chair, she snatched a crumpet on the way out, juggling the three she hurried down the stairs. She had be early today, there was an announcement on another new patch coming through, an occurrence every few weeks.\r\n\r\nCaitlyn arrived in the hall just on time as head summoner Morello strode to the front and greeted all the champions present. He breezed through the pleasantries, quickly listing all the new changes that were to take place. Caitlyn listened half-interestedly; she knew the gist of these meetings, a little buff here or there, mostly a nerf to something or Irelia, sometimes a rework if they felt like being extravagant. \r\n\r\nThe air beside her shimmered as Nami appeared, accompanied by a puddle of water. Due to her teleport platform&rsquo;s instability underwater, there had been many occasions where she&rsquo;d missed matches completely from ending up in random places. Caitlyn amusingly recalled the last time where Nami had accidentally materialised in the Demacian Palace&rsquo;s male saunas. \r\n\r\nA large smile appeared on Nami&rsquo;s face when she saw Caitlyn, jumping in for a quick hug.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I was almost late again&hellip;I accidentally ended up in Fiora&rsquo;s bathroom and made her slip.&rdquo; She admitted sheepishly. \r\n\r\nCaitlyn stifled a laugh, bidding Nami good luck and have fun before stepping into their respective circle, the lines pulsing and rings of light glowing brighter.\r\n\r\nWith a final beam of bright light, Caitlyn vanished.\r\n________________________________________\r\nCaitlyn couldn&rsquo;t believe Varus was going to live, he was on a sliver of health.\r\n\r\nCursing, she had to back off. Thresh was advancing and deep wards showed Jax and Victor coming too. He was too close for her to succeed in outrunning him and she had exhausted her flash against Varus just then.\r\n\r\nPerhaps now would be a good time to employ some of Vi&#039;s choicest swear words.\r\n\r\nReeling around with a swift, fluid movement of her arm, Caitlyn flipped up her rifle and fired her signature ninety calibre net at Thresh, recoiling herself over the wall and slowing the nutjob down for good measure. Mustering up a burst of energy, Caitlyn dashed through the river and ducked into an inconspicuous bush. \r\n\r\nGood thing she knew Summoner&#039;s Rift like the back of her hand. Couldn&#039;t say the same for some of the new blood around though, what with their tendency to facecheck bushes.\r\n\r\nThe fight with Varus had been calculated in her favour, yes, and she almost netted the kill. The incoming gank turned the tables though and forced her to abandon the chase to stay alive. Where were the early MIA pings? She had anticipated a gank, but for three of them to corner her off had caught her off guard. \r\n\r\nPressing her back against the wall, she steadied her rifle against her shoulder as she winced in pain, glancing down. Ah yes, hard to forget the gaping large slash across her stomach from her duel with Varus just before. The skirmish had roughed her up badly as she probed the deep laceration, her fingers slick with blood. The whole front of her dress had been slashed and the deep gouge was bleeding out, rivulets of blood seeping down and staining her purple fabric a dark ugly maroon.\r\n\r\nCocking her head to one side, she could hear the faraway sounds of Gangplank&#039;s ultimate going off. Even if she had the damage to take out Victor before one could say cupcakes, she was at a numbers disadvantage. The enemy Warwick was also missing, probably frolicking with his kind in the wolf camp, damn mutt. Needless to say, Warwick had never really gotten off on quite the right foot with her.\r\n\r\nAny extended skirmish and strain she put on her stomach was going to deepen the wound and death by bleeding could possibly be one of the most tragic ways to die in a match.\r\n\r\nThat or to the raptor camp.\r\n\r\nShe was going to have to base. Kneeling down on one knee, she shifted her gun to her right hand and began recalling.\r\n________________________________________\r\n&ldquo;Defeat, defeat, defeat, defeat&hellip; ugh&rdquo;\r\n\r\nCaitlyn muttered to herself as she ruffled her hair whilst she set the kettle on, rubbing it dry after a soothing post-match shower. It was bloody tiring trying to solo carry. At least she achieved a pentakill in the last game, which was the only highlight.\r\n\r\nThere was an increasingly loud thudding coming towards her room before the door smashed down loudly as Vi barged in.\r\n\r\nCaitlyn sighed. The doors at her house had to be replaced at least ten times a month because of this.\r\n\r\nVi had dragged in with her a scruffy looking man whose face had most probably seen better days. \r\n\r\n&quot;Hey cupcake, wanna go for a raid later?&quot; She seemed to be in high spirits from winning her games, pumping her fist in the air as her other hand shook around the man like a mop across the floor.\r\n\r\nCaitlyn sighed again.\r\n\r\n&quot;What have told you about treating criminals?&quot; She crossed her arms and raised a stern eyebrow at the poor fellow she had lugged in.\r\n\r\n&quot;That I shouldn&#039;t punch them. Or was it scrunch them? Eh whatever, something like that.&quot; She lifted up the poor fellow as he groaned.\r\n\r\n&quot;But this one was resisting arrest and even gave me cheek. So I punched it.&quot; Vi turned to look at the disgruntled man.\r\n\r\n&quot;What was the crime?&quot; Caitlyn asked.\r\n\r\n&quot;They had a scam going in some alleyway, Free Cart Monty-&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Three Card Monte.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;- yea whatever. I already booted the other punks to jail.&quot; She turn back to face Caitlyn and shot out her hand, dangling the unfortunate man in front of her by the scruff of his neck. He groaned.\r\n\r\n&quot;Thought this one would make nice target practice for you.&quot; Vi grinned, clearly pleased with her choice of victim. Caitlyn rolled her eyes.\r\n\r\n&quot;Send him off to the prison as well.&quot; Caitlyn exhaled in exasperation, returning to towelling her hair. \r\n\r\n&quot;You really need to stop playing with your criminals!&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;But c&#039;mooon, this one&#039;s a present for you.&quot; Vi sulked, feigning hurt at Caitlyn&#039;s disapproval of her present. Furrowing her brows in thought, her face lit up before grinning mischievously again.\r\n\r\n&quot;I&#039;ll use him for my practice then.&quot; She turned to leave. &quot;I think I can get a few more good punches outta him.&quot; Vi continued on enthusiastically as she left, dragging the hapless guy out the non-existent door with her. Caitlyn resisted the urge roll her eyes again. There was just no controlling Vi.\r\n\r\nThe old kettle whistled impatiently and Caitlyn poured herself a cup of Piltover&#039;s Finest Tea, stirring in the milk and a good pinch of cinnamon for the added zing. Caitlyn smiled to herself. Vi always had an issue with that, claiming that adding cinnamon to tea was &#039;downright psycho&#039;. Then again, that could be because she had unsuspectingly downed a whole cup in one go, which had promptly sent her off to the nearest sink.\r\n\r\nCaitlyn pushed the gears, gizmos and soldering iron off her desk, clearing a space to place her cup. Sitting down to relax, she cupped her tea, absentmindedly looking out the window overseeing the city treasury, a grand and golden building by the sparkling docks and the shining beacon of Piltovian pride in hextech security. \r\n\r\nIt was too late to visit the local shooting range; she would have to take up on Miss Fortune&#039;s friendly challenge another day. \r\n\r\nShe took a sip of the now lukewarm tea as the light outside faded. \r\n\r\nLady Fortune wouldn&#039;t be much competition of course, not when she used such a haphazard method as firing everywhere. Even Soraka could hit a target with that method. Not that she&#039;d let Soraka near any guns though, not after that catastrophe last time at the annual carnival with the Shoot-the-Poros fair game. That had been a downright mess to clean up. \r\n\r\nShe chuckled to herself at the memory. \r\n\r\nThe sky had turned dark as street lights flickered on, her tea long gone cold. \r\n\r\nCaitlyn sighed wearily, placing the cup down.\r\n\r\nAnother average day was over.","replies":[]}
