If they are doing it every single game, it would likely be enough to push them into a punishment, but every now and again (just when they don't get their main role) isn't enough on it's own to net a punishment. Frankly I think it should be, but it isn't. It usually has to be combined with other offences.\n\nThat said, if you see someone who's doing it a lot, please report them. The more history they have with such offences, the more ammo there is when punishment time comes around. If you dodge the lobby or can't use post game for whatever other reason, you can report them through support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-09-24T02:07:13.056+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When did Ranked return to blind pick O.o? I haven't seen a i go x lane excuse since season 4 or 5\n\nNo its not punishable, since riot don't give two shits about what happens in pre/post game just dodge out, -3lp and a 5 min wait is better than -20lp and 30 mins of wasted time and you can't really instalock, you hover that champ everyone knows you're gonna play it.","replies":[]}]}
