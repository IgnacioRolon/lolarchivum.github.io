I see that my violations were wrong and that i made the wrong decision.  I had a previous 14 day ban and have not learnt from my mistakes. However, i would like to ask Riot for a last chance. After my permanent ban i saw that my actions were unacceptable and i would have to change. I am extremely disappointed in myself and know that i will change and will not be the same person that i was when i received that ban.  I realise that the players in the game are real people and that i am hurting them. And that is why i wish to change. I had spent money on my account and put hard work and effort into building it from the ground up. I ask you for another chance which will really change me as a person. I do not want to be like other people and become toxic again. I sincerely apoligise. \r\n\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\n666Storm: lol\r\n666Storm: maybe grouup up?\r\n666Storm: report kaisa\r\n666Storm: report\r\n666Storm: THAT\r\n666Storm: %%%GOT\r\n666Storm: 3/9\r\n666Storm: retard\r\n666Storm: i didnt\r\n666Storm: fuckin\r\n666Storm: feed\r\n666Storm: them\r\n666Storm: kys\r\n666Storm: 3/10\r\n666Storm: 3/10\r\n666Storm: 3/10\r\n666Storm: 3/10\r\n666Storm: 3/10\r\n666Storm: 3/10\r\n666Storm: 3/10\r\n666Storm: 3/10\r\n666Storm: 3/10\r\n666Storm: 3/10\r\n666Storm: 3/10\r\n666Storm: 3/10\r\n666Storm: just group\r\n666Storm: nice cs\r\n666Storm: \"go ff\"\r\n666Storm: -zac\r\n666Storm: go ff\r\n666Storm: gg ez\r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-07-13T10:17:43.334+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your 14 day ban *was* your last chance. It is explicitly stated in the 14 day ban reform card that any further violations will result in permanent suspension of the account.\n\nYou say that one more chance will really change you as a person, but why didn't the 14 day ban if you truly realised how bad your behaviour was? You have to understand that Riot have absolutely no reason to give you the benefit of the doubt here. Not only did you apparently ignore the warning of your 14 day ban, your logs include pretty much every kind (and the worst kinds) of chat toxicity there is.\n\nYou're looking at suicide encouragement, ableism, homophobia, spam and giving up the game all in that one short log. Consider RIot's perspective, and the perspective of the players on the other side of that log, and ask yourself then if you really deserve that one more chance.\n\nYou are of course more than welcome to create a new account, and use it as an opportunity to turn your behaviour around, but there is no chance that you will be getting this account back.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-07-13T10:54:37.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"you're banned for kys etc. You deserve it for being a dick.\nStart again at level 1, I did it back in season 2 and I reformed to never look back","replies":[]}]}
