Please visit the [Connection Troubleshooting Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and perform all the steps listed. Try playing in a Custom match first to test it so you don't incur penalties. Let me know if anything helps.\n\n-DTN","replies":[{"poster":"Hi Im VermiIion","date":"2016-02-03T07:03:34.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Checked everything, could not find a solution, its weird, this morning i had a normal game...","replies":[]}]}]}
