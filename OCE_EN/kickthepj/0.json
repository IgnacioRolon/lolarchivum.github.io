as a Zhonyas, Banshees or Liandries (Only if you're really ahead, otherwise go with one of the other two,  this in turn stacks with rylais which gives you more DoT) {{item:3157}} {{item:3102}}  {{item:3151}} \n\n* Void Staff {{item:3135}} \n\n* End with a Deathcap (if you're winning hard you can get it before void staff) {{item:3089}} \n\nIf you want to play her support (Proper Support) i'd suggest:\n\n*  Eye of the Ascended {{item:3069}} \n\n* Redemption or Ardent (you can get both, but to save item slots it'd be better to take one over the other, much like above pick based on  matchup) {{item:3107}} {{item:3504}} \n\n* Boots (Ionian is a must) {{item:3173}} \n\n* Rylais (like before, non-committal cc) {{item:3116}} \n\n* Zekes or Shurelyas {{item:3050}}  {{item:2065}} (Again, Matchup based, if you're getting harassed a lot Zekes gives you a little bit of tankyness, and in turn you and your adc get a particle effect, which gives the adc a brief red buff and you a slow, if not, you can go Shurelyas to move fast  for an easier engage especially if your tank is a pleb or you don't have one, and gain mana regen and cdr)\n\n* Finish with a Deathcap {{item:3089}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-09-29T02:06:38.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I said Zyra because in terms of utility they are similar.\nI pick Lux support in situations where I need a fast lockdown skill and the team is ad heavy. I pick Zilean support when I need AoE lockdown or want to protect a hypercarry and the team is ad heavy. I pick Morgana when we need picks and a clustered teamfight and the team is ad heavy. I pick Annie support when we need burst against mobile bruisers and we're ad heavy. I pick brand support when the enemy has alot of tanks and we're ad heavy.\n\nThere is alot of variety to mage supports and when to pick them. \nNext onto your builds, tear of the goddess and similarly RoA is too slow for a support mage. For a midlaner it's fine, because they get more gold early on, they don't have a support item to prioritize, and they're in a solo lane so they can afford to get bullied a little in exchange for the extra value, and the extra mana means they aren't going to get shoved on so easily. For a support, this is terribly selfish and inefficient. You aren't csing or pushing much with your mana, you have limited early gold to start with, and you're in a 2v2 lane, where every powerspike is huge and you probably picked a mage support to dominate lane. The mana is nice, but cooldown reduction and ability power are more important to focus on, since unlike a midlaner you don't have to use mana on minion waves.\n\nI don't see why you'd build Rylias on Lux, her e already slows by a considerable amount, and it's more of a luxury ap item, than a core one, since it's gold inefficient. Twin shadows would be far far more efficient and increases your utility by a much larger amount. Not much else for the ap build aside from the fact that void staff is usually pretty overkill in situations where you'd pick Lux support, since Morrellos is usually going to be more efficient since the enemy probably won't be stacking mr for only a support and being able to cut healing and having the flat pen against squishies is often going to have greater impact.\n\nYour shielding support build disgusts me.\nAgain, Twin Shadows>Rylias,\nAlso unless it's a hard matchup vs a kill lane, i'd still go for the more aggressive spellthief line, since Lux uses ap, the extra ping damage on spellthiefs passive is very good poke when auto trading with the ad and you will usually have the range advantage thanks to Lux's spells and auto range.\n**Big thing 1**you don't pick either redemption or ardent, redemption healing triple scales with shielding/healing power, so if you're going this route, you always get both.\n**Big thing 2**, why don't have you have an **Athene's Unholy Grail** in that shield Lux build. The extra burst of 250hp healing from Athene's bloodwell passive which lux can very easily charge and spam for mad sustain, the 50ap(60ap post ardent, and 90ap post redemption) 30mr 10% cdr 100% mana regen, all for the low low price of 2100g is insanely good gold efficiency.\nFinally deathcap isn't really that efficient when you don't have much ap, you'd probably actually get more out of a knights vow or any of the other support items I've mentioned.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
