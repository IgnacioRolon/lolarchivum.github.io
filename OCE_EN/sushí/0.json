I pretty much play it for the competitive aspect of the game really dont care to much about the whole \"fun\" side of it. Currently in Plat 4 only played <100 ranked solo this season so if i grinded could get high plat probably. Also run a ranked 5s team with some mates thats in Gold2 team consists and has consisted of diamond tier and been playing some norms with couple challengers to learn the game better. Let me know i do shift work but normally always available at night time. \n\nOf course i got Skype, Ts3. \n\nNormally play the shotcaller in my team but happy not to do so.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pandadude123","date":"2015-11-04T09:32:17.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would also be keen to play the top lane role for your team, i have been in a few ranked teams last season of which we did very well and i played efficiently as a top lane.
