The league of legends logo will open and then my screen goes black for a little while and then closes. I can still click the league button and it will come up as a black screen and then close league.  I have to restart my computer several times before I can get into the game and by the time I do, the game is already at least 5 minutes in.","replies":[{"poster":"cmse","date":"2014-12-21T11:06:25.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"cmse","date":"2014-12-19T11:56:43.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can hear all of the sound in-game but it does not open.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2014-12-17T04:44:55.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi cmse,\n\nPlease see our recent post on this issue [here](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/zgUdmTen-firewall-errorblack-screen-after-champion-select).","replies":[{"poster":"cmse","date":"2014-12-19T11:56:10.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Gehirn,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=jT1YhdIA,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2014-12-17T04:44:55.332+0000)\n>\n> Hi cmse,\n> \n> Please see our recent post on this issue [here](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/zgUdmTen-firewall-errorblack-screen-after-champion-select).\n\nDoesn't work :/","replies":[]}]}]}
