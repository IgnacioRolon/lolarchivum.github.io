As in, you are able to load it correctly. If that's true, then being in a game connected to other people is what's causing this to happen on your computer, BUT the error you are getting is not a \"Connection failed\" or anything like that, it's a critical part of hardware failing to boot up i.e. your display.\n\nI don't understand how this is possible.\n\nAre you 100% that it's not something silly like League is configured to use a resolution that your monitor doesn't support (even though, that would mean you couldn't get the custom game running)? That you don't have another program installed which is causing your screen to black out if it detects a PvP connection?\n\nThis is just unbelievable. What happens if you make a custom game with bots, and one friend in it? Does your screen remain black? Is your friend able to see you move/speak in the chat?","replies":[{"poster":"cmse","date":"2015-01-24T02:15:09.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A couple of times while going into a game and getting my black screen, I get 'connection failed' or something along those lines.
