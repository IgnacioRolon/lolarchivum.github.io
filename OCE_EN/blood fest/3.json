She cannot win a game AFKing on someone and doing nothing.\n\n\"everytime morg q me cait would e behind me q then auto when this happen the yuumi would jump off me and i was dead.\"\n\nThat's because Yuumi is smart. If she stayed attached to you, she would die. Cait + Morg is an aids lane. Hit by one CC and you're dead. Judging by your posts, you cannot dodge CC reliably. In case you aren't aware, Caitlyn can two-shot Yuumi at level 10. Trap + Auto + Q = dead Yuumi. Yuumi has low base health and armour as she's not meant to be hit. If she does get hit, it's her own fault.\n\n\"another thing when yuumi is on me cait and morg only had one person to skill shot at between that and trying not stand on traps\ni couldnt cs very well. i got tilted\"\n\nThis is a 'you' issue. Stand behind minions so Morg's snare does not hit you and then skillshots aren't an issue. Also, you got tilted. Boom, that right there is proof enough that this issue is your fault.\n\n\"i have also find yuumi players do not ward as good as other supports as they dont really get off and walk to ward cause no boots\ni have not yet played yuumi.\"\n\nProbably in your elo. Sometimes it's better to hold a ward then place it every moment. Example, if the enemy mid and enemy jungler are topside, no need to ward.\n\nI feel like ADC players should try every support to see how they play. Nothing worse than playing a support and having your ADC just do nothing. You need to understand when your support spikes and when they are behind. Yuumi is a poke champion, essentially. She needs to hit Qs. If you cosntantly scrap with her like she's Thresh, Alistar, or Leona, it'll end badly.\n\nFrom your match history, it looks like ADC isn't your role. May I suggest Annie midlane? That should be around your level.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-09-22T13:57:19.442+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assuming this isn't bait-\n\n>I feel its a lazy players champ. i dont like yuumi support when im adc in rank.\n\nDon't blame you, she is a pretty lazy champ, but then again, you got to remember you have to be sitting on 4 people to use her effectively. \n\n>just had a game with me as mf and random as yuumi\neverytime morg q me cait would e behind me q then auto when this happen the yuumi would jump off me and i was dead.\n\nSo, in other words, you sat in everything/refused to sidestep?\nSounds like a you issue\n\n>another thing when yuumi is on me cait and morg only had one person to skill shot at between that and trying not stand on traps\ni couldnt cs very well. i got tilted\n\nI mean, the heals are cheap as hell, so it doesnt really matter. \nAnd again, all easy to dodge sooooooooooooooooooooooooo, again, you issue.\n\n>i have also find yuumi players do not ward as good as other supports as they dont really get off and walk to ward cause no boots\n\nSo because 1 did trash, we're all trash?\nBy YOUR words, all adcs are trashy because you did trashy. \n\n>i have not yet played yuumi.\n\nYou might wanna give her a try, shes fun af. \nyou might also learn something.\n\n>i mean how hard is it to jump on someone that someone your on walks you everywhere. you push few buttons its just lazy\n\nI'm supporting 4 people and making them immortal, you try that when theyre sitting in everything\n\n\nHonestly, this seems more like a you problem and not a Yuumi player problem :/\nHell, ill support you to show you how fun it gets.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2019-09-23T06:47:31.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"everytime morg q me cait would e behind me q then auto when this happen the yuumi would jump off me and i was dead.\"\n\nI'm curious what you think the yuumi is capable in this situation.\n\nAnd also what any other champion is capable of in this situation.\n\nLet's take leona for example, you take a morg Q, then leona has to engage or leave you for dead, but engaging because you just ate a morg Q for free isn't what she should do in that scenario.","replies":[]}]}
