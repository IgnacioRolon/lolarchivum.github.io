If you are loading in fullscreen mode and alt-tab you're telling you're computer \"hey, don't do this thing just yet\" which given that the game client has to interface with 9 other players is a pretty bad idea. \n\nSounds like you've also had some patching issues. You have to remember to run League in admin mode, as not having those permissions can break the patching process, try setting League to run as admin then running a repair. If a repair doesn't do it then run a clean install through the Hextech Repair tool after setting up permissions.\n\nMaybe next time, make an effort to fix the issues that are on your end and not the clients, before you start complaining about the game rightly punishing you for ruining other player's games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"69ms","date":"2017-04-28T05:06:03.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How old are you btw?
