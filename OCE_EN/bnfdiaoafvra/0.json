Sometimes you need it. \r\n\r\nI was just in champ select and we had 2 adc&#039;s, 2 tops, 1 mid.... Everyone was arguing that they were not going to change their lane so I had to dodge as I knew I would not enjoy that game. Yet I am the one with 5min waiting period because of idiots. \r\n\r\nCan you implement a 30 sec voting system that if 3 people vote we all get 30 sec more to pick champs or change them. \r\n\r\nJust sometimes you need that little extra time. \r\n\r\nI can&#039;t tell you how many times I myself and many others had forgotten about masteries and runes until the last second but ran out of time. \r\nThose games are just not enjoyable and isn&#039;t that what you are trying to make of your game? Enjoyment?\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know because lately I do not see enjoyment. I see anger and competition, when this is supposed to be a video game for anyone to enjoy.\r\n\r\nHave a think about where this game is going because I know that you are all aware that this game has gotten out of hand.\r\nPeople have also died playing your game for too long. Do you even care? \r\n\r\nWhatever. Just stuff you need to think about for the future Riot","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-11-30T06:06:42.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey bnfdiaoafvra,\n\nWhile we do appreciate well thought out suggestions, because this is the Help & Support sub-boards, we try to limit posts to technical issues and general questions.
