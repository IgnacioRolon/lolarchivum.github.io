The system that detects third party software (as far as I know) doesn't have any way of distinguishing programs. I believe it works by basically monitoring changes to files/data/packets etc so I wouldn't think an APM counter would trigger it (it mostly just detects when you are ingame and counts clicks and keystrokes right?). Now Riot CAN'T overturn permanent bans, they are permanent on their end too so even if they agree the ban is unjustified there's still no way to get your account back.\n\nAll that said, Riot has basically said it's a use at your own risk scenario. If you can find a bit more about how the system itself works (I'm hardly an expert...or even a novice) then you could probably work out if the APM counter would be affecting anything the system monitors, but past that..use at your own risk is pretty much the best advice.\n\nAlso this is based on what I've heard from Riot and what little I know about their systems, so I could be wrong anywhere along the way but...well I hope it helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-11-15T13:47:26.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes","replies":[]}]}
