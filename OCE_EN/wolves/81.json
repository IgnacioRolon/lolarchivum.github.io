RIOT?","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":16,"down_votes":3,"body":"So from time to time I come across a team mate who  &quot;Vents&quot;. Now the person who &quot;Vents&quot; is anyone who definitely likes to relay frustration build up due to the bad game , or a person doing bad, or simply just not getting along with someone and they tend to do this to both your team and the enemy team. \n\nNow usually I tend to mute these players so I no longer get to read their built up frustrations but not everyone is intelligent enough to do it and it degrades their play. Not to mention if it a quarrel between two other players on your team, you can mute them but they will still be at each other throats and no matter how many times you tell them to &quot;mute and play&quot; neither one is looking to back down.\n\nThis however gave me an idea. What if we as the players not involved in the quarrel had the power to chat restrict the players for the game you were playing and immediately put a halt to the ongoing **chat war**. You still have the power to mute them individually but if its getting to that stage where they are just stopping to reply to the other person every 10 seconds that hinders their impact on the game at hand, having this tool would be very beneficial.\n\n**How it works**\nRight next to the mute player button, we would have the nominate for chat restriction button. This apart from the player being nominated will bring up a vote to restrict the player from using the chat. Very similar to a surrender vote but for a different purpose. The vote would be between 4 people apart from the player being nominated and the rest will now have the option to agree to restrict this player from using the chat till the end of the game. There is still a level of team work required as near 3 people must agree for the restriction to go through. \n\nMeaning if the quarrel was between two team mates, you can do back to back chat restrictions as the remaining 3 sensible players of the game who queued up to play a game and not be part of an argument get their say in the matter. Also means that player wanting to continue the quarrel and votes no you still can get a chat restriction for the nominated player.\n\nAt the end of the game the restricted player gets a pop stating he was chat restricted due to an improper use of the chat system. This however will not impact him in anyway but will or can be considered for future actions by tribunal in chat restricting the person for several games.\n\n**What are your thoughts on this idea.?**","replies":[{"poster":"Zoom","date":"2016-08-08T06:07:30.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I unfortunately disagree as well, by using this feature I feel that when your team chat restricts somebody this will make them a lot saltier and more inclined to intentionally feed or troll especially as they know they have had this restriction imposed by them on the people in the team. The mute function works perfectly fine in my opinion and like soul said people just need to learn how to use it. Some things are out of your control due to the intense nature of the game and how frustrating it can sometimes get, however its the same as any physical sport where two players can get worked up with each other. You either need to use that mute button that's there for a reason and report them afterward or contribute to helping , in the case it is two other team mates, to work out their differences and focus on the main objective of taking down the enemy nexus.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolves","date":"2016-08-08T07:10:46.433+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think this is like an authoritative command. Under our current mute system. The person you mute still will continue to use his chat as if you had not muted them at all. And he will continue to do these in games as he believes he is relaying his point and getting it out there. But say per chat restriction as soon as this person starts his rant there is an instant stop function. Its literally saying \"**No this is not acceptable behaviour**\" as soon as it starts, so a negative priming effect or feedback loop what ever you want to call it. But say if this happened in several games of this person he would then self reflect and potentially change for the better. \n\nI know bans are what most people are saying solves this issue but really, I don't want to get this person banned (as he potentially could be a skilled player with a bad behavior), I really want him to just stop using chat and play the game which the entire 10 people committed 20 minutes of their lifetime to play. I did not take 20 minutes out of my life to see you quarrel and ruin everyone's day or mood.\n\nOther things we can do is probably implement this in only ranked games so its where it is a competitive environment and no room for **temper tantrums**. In normal games you can do it as much as you like as it is meant to be the social side of things. Also in my books a written communication that takes more than 4 seconds is inefficient. Chat is usually used for timing summoner spells. quick strats such as camping a bush, baiting. All of which can be easily portrayed by **pings** alone.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wolves","date":"2016-08-08T05:13:58.779+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4wokar/chat_restricting_someone_for_the_active_game_your/\n\nI also did a reddit post","replies":[]},{"poster":"SoulHuntah","date":"2016-08-08T04:05:12.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I disagree, this is highly abusable.

I dont use chat that much I am more of a pings kind of a guy.  I generally use chat for timers for summoner spells. If someone chat restricted me for a the game I wouldnt care much I can still ping and probably be a down side to them since I cant time the summoner timers.","replies":[]}]}]}
