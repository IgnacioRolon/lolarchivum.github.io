Now its all about daddy issues, mommy issues, heck even lifestyle issues. If you want to go over this please get a psychologist they will help ya or play some normal games. I dont need to deal with your troubles and projections in a ranked game where I am playing to win.\n\nIncase you havent noticed no one cares about your feelings, the enemy team rejoices and enjoys it when you quarrel and project in all chat. Heck its even in the top 10 list of ways to guarantee a ranked game victory.\n\nAnd whats with all these gg , ff at 20. Are you clairvoyant, can you tell the future if so please predict me some lotto winning number so I can stop playing this game but no you aren&#039;t. So how the heck can you tell the future if you haven&#039;t even made the effort at avoiding such an outcome. All your doing is making a false prediction because you dont wana play and then afking or start flaming someone so you guarantee the outcome you predicted hails true. You sir or maddam are very scummy and should burn somewhere not nice.\n\nAll your doing by queuing up taking someone elses 20min of life that they will probably never get back because you have no one to talk too. I mean seriously how sad is it. Please get off my queues and if anything go play normals if you want friends.\n\nIF you dont know how ranked is played than here is some tips.\n\nYou&#039;re meant to go even in your ( stay the same level and at least 20 cs behind in counter matchups to have similar power spikes.)\nYou sir are not given a gank it&#039;s a luxury (if you expect one please change your roles.)\nNo one is asking you to win the lane, it&#039;s a commonly stupid misconception ( games are won via team fights not lane)\nNo one is asking for you to carry the game, un necessary burden ( now you&#039;re worried about losing when you haven&#039;t even focused on the game yet)\nPings were made for communication not the chat ( I dont wana read an essay in chat thanks to a simple ping tells me your next move and if you cant interperate that please get your head checked)\nChat was made for timmers not to hold a conversation inhib, camp, summoners and ults only ( If you&#039;re the one that types every 10 seconds. DO the math on a 20min and you will find yourself spending nearly half as much time talking in chat than playing, might as well sit on facebook or twitter and not bother playing.)\n\nIf you can&#039;t adhere to any of these than you are not ready for ranked, so get out of my queues.","replies":[{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-11-02T01:10:46.781+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good call, Wolves. Ranked is for serious play, not chatting or playing a champion for the first time. Don't ruin it for the other players by doing those things. If you wanna chit chat, go waste your time playing \"the number game\", or \"continue the story\" in these forums. Heaps of good meaningless chit chat in there.\n\nTLDR: Communicate, but don't chit chat about other rubbish in game.

Shotcalling is more than just pings, especially at lower elo where pinging an ult and an on my way, isn't apparently obvious to a laner.\n\nI had a game recently where we were losing badly to an enemy malphite, yasou, oriana premade wombo combo strategy. After discussing counter strategies after we lost a teamfight we ended up turning the game around by baiting out the wombocombo onto our tankiest team member the support alistair by using a sivir spellshield walking next to a full tank sup alistair and by spreading out the rest of our teammembers. Malphite ulted, sivir spellshielded, ulted and ran away and alistair took the yasou and oriana ultimates and then knocked up the yasou and malphite to allow the team to kill them. I know the enemy team did something stupid, however we found the malphite was lower elo than his premade and we developed a strategy in the chat around this. So in summary, strategy discussion is useful in bronze and silver though maybe at higher elo these sorts of discussions are less necessary due to everyone having an understanding of inherent counter strategies. \n\nIf we hadn't chatted, we would have all stood on the same spot like the silver/bronze scrubs we were, and in low elo everyone stands on top of each other normally which was making us lose very hard.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolves","date":"2016-11-03T02:27:17.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See now I get your side of the story but heres why it isnt valid. \nFirstly its bronze right so there isnt any point discussion strategy if your not at a level where you can execute it near perfection of viability.\nIn most circumstances its just a clown fiesta \n\nThere are more important things regarding your own play that you need to consider before playing at a team level. And I have heard stories from that elo I know how funny it is really. Does not necessarily mean you read or seen someone do a surgery that you can explain it to someone else and do it yourself. \n\nIf your capabilities are above the average player in bronze you will more than likely climb with ease. No need to explain to minds that dont have a clear grasp its better to do well and let them follow you around. Everything you just stated and mention streamers do this but probably would be a higher level personal meaning that they are at a level where it takes more than individual skill to win games.\n\nDo you understand where I am coming from now. And no I am not complaining about typing strategy in chat. I am complaining about people over using it. Strategy changes within a couple of seconds and by the time your finish that particular sentence the window of opportunity is missed hence why pings were developed.\n\nHopefully that gives you some insight.","replies":[{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-11-05T08:19:24.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wolves,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=1gAnHxhR,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2016-11-03T02:27:17.687+0000)\n>\n> Strategy changes within a couple of seconds and by the time your finish that particular sentence the window of opportunity is missed hence why pings were developed.\n\nThe amount of times that I've called \"Baron!\" and the team just start it up willy nilly, not looking at the minimap seeing that enemies just came out of the fog of war :\\\nYesterday there was a game where we had 4 players in the pit, but our jungler was dead, and then suddenly the enemy Lee Sin jungle approaches the area (we had it set up with wards), I ping them off the baron.... but they just keep doing it because it was getting low, 2000-ish health. Free leash. Seriously some people don't think with their own brains in this game. And they certainly cannot adapt on the fly if someone makes a call which is _**right at the time of the call**_, but 20 seconds later is a bad call if people aren't watching the map and using their noodle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wolves","date":"2016-11-03T02:31:42.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also they very first paragraph you mentioned strategy and abilities to be aware of.
