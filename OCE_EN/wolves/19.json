I release two videos every week and also do a read through of patch notes to see what is in and whats out. \r\n\r\nGenerally these are vidoes of me talking about things that people dnt usually do or consider it to be important in improving game plays. There are more videos to come and please give feed back, I wana know how I can make these better and more entertaining as well as bringing you the best knowledge in the best way possible. Help a brother out.!\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYgTIWeOi3c&amp;list=PLnT49b6t7H9Lo_ddR78-zzoO963ymcw8Z&amp;index=2\r\n\r\nEnjoy","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-03-03T03:18:07.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Big fan of channels like this, looks great so far. \n\nI recommend you look to the big channels of your genre, for tips on how to improve your videos. Specifically guys like [gbay99](https://www.youtube.com/user/gbay99), [Jeremy Gaming Curios](https://www.youtube.com/user/GamingCurios), [Foxdrop](https://www.youtube.com/user/foxdropLoL), [Phylol](https://www.youtube.com/user/ThePhylol), [Redmercy](https://www.youtube.com/user/Redmercy) and [Pants are Dragon](https://www.youtube.com/user/luigidragon).\n\nI'd say, you can massively improve the quality of your content, just by speeding up your points. You want to aim to have most videos at 5 minutes or less. Anything 10 minutes or more will discourage viewers from clicking on your videos.\n\nLooking forward to future uploads ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Wolves","date":"2016-03-05T05:39:46.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey cheers man I will definately look into stuff and yea speeding up things is my biggest issue but looking forward to resolving them","replies":[]}]}]}
