Ashe is one of the only champs that can match lane decently safe against Caitly with similar AA range. Considering it was a morgana support and king is a mechanical player that can position well and that rakkan could have also blocked the morg bind.\nThe other factor you have to consider is ashe can bait out a morgana sheild very easily, putting alot of pressure on the morg to keep her sheild up and lowering chance of harrass.\nBot lane gets a level 6 all in threat that is fueled by a zac gank.\n\nConsidering they had no global pressue champs and ashe would have allowed for both picks and a global pressure once rotated into mid as both irelia and vlad could take the side lanes. They would have also matched a mid game to late game carry power spike compensating for a losing irelia top. \n\nNext with the irelia pick it could have very well been an Orrn or a Shen/ Illaoi. Based on super massives comp they would have struggled against any of the other champion choices. We would have either matched global, matched team fight damage out put or won at choke fights. All of those 3 attributes could have given them a better chance rather than the snowball factor they were hoping for.\n\nThe other thing they didnt consider or do was just go for the lane swap from level 1. GP can do okay in a 1 v 2 lane but it significantly slows down his power spike. Dire Wolves would have lost dragon and first tower. But would have controlled the top side of the map and accelerated their adc mid game while removing the effectiveness of Destiny from the Twisted Fate. \nTheir Jungler would have been masked but accounted for, same for the other team. Supports would have been free to pressure mid therefore vladamir could have played aggressive or a steady stalemate which would have worked in Triples favour.\n\nSince tanks work well on lower economy they would have controlled mid game before GP was able to dish out damage. In which case DireWovles could have closed out the game before late game.\n\nAlthough this is all theory based, it may have significantly increased our chances. I do want to add that I do not have data from scrims of Dire Wolves to account for their choices but even so from an outsider perspective this is what should have been done. Games still didnt feel as refined. Warding wasnt optimal and overall decision making wasnt the best.\n\nAgain nerves play a huge part but how long can we hide under that excuse.\n\nNote: (If I were to try and explain this with all the details surrounding it. I think I would be writing a 10-page article) So instead here is the short version. Hope you follow along.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-05-07T03:52:50.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like how there are still passionate people around in the scene (yourself). Most of the people in the scene would look at this and go \"tldr\". \n\nI have to agree with you - I was very disappointed in the draft for the game with Supermassive, and also the first game on the second day that they played. Especially after what Sharp said in his video.\n\nI think Dire Wolves got extremely lucky the first time that they played Kabum, but on day two their weaknesses were fully exposed. The main one is what Raz was talking about in the post mortem of SUP vs PGM - vision control and rotations. Supermassive were working together as a team to get this down. The support/jungle buddy system.\n\nThe baron call in the second game with Kabum was terrible. Once again the Oceanic special issue of lack of patience at that moment. You can see this issue so often in challenger soloqueue games. Probably we are the region of throws and this is the reason. It was the time to establish vision. Raz suggested to bait the baron, but i think in that case it would only secure you a blue trinket kill. Still would have been better.\n\nPlus they kept skirmishing in the enemy's vision, not theirs. Supermassive (and PGM game 2) would rotate into deep territory only when they had lane priority in the lanes near the rotation, and they would take at least two players to lay down this vision. Then they could easily work out where Shernfire was for the rest of the game. Dire Wolves' warding was scattered and often in the wrong places.\nThe Yasuo draft game was very one dimentional, and when the opposition picked split pushers that also could win lane, it became problematic. It would have made more sense to not blind pick the Yasuo.\n\nIn the PGM game, after botching a teamfight, I again noticed that one play that emphasizes the region: lack of patience. They tried to make a pick on the support near the blue buff with 3 members, and got collapsed on by 4 members... again lack of vision control to make that sort of play. The fed Leblanc came and cleaned house.\n\nThe only takeaway from the event was the improvement in the play of Triple. His positioning was vastly improved from the OPL split games, and he actually was rock solid which was impressive for one of the newer players to the team.\n\nDire Wolves cockiness improved somewhat in this event (day one noticeable). But on day two they completely fell to pieces.\n\nSeriously though, OCE is going to make these errors every year unless someone can teach them progress on these mistakes. Its not players from other regions that they should be hiring, its coaches. Dire Wolves have won the OPL because they have good players in each position and their macro improved (since 2016). But considering the competition that they are facing in the OPL, its not such a great achievement if the other regions are just so far ahead in this respect. It would be a good idea to get an experienced coach working alongside Sharp to fix these issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolves","date":"2018-05-07T04:03:16.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I agree, it was basic macro rotations that were being done nothing special. But with the inability to respond to predict or respond to them that was the ultimate downfall. I feel they either aren't emphasizing strategy as much in their game discussions or the players revert to solo queue tendencies when faced with high-pressure situations.\n\nI am interested to know who the anchor for the team is. As Cupcake and King dont look like the type and Shern can only do so much, Chippys could be he is more focused on his lane so therefore Triple is best choice atm.\n\nAnd again I think Triple is being very undervalued as a player he has so much experience and talent behind him as a player and if he isn't stepping up in Comms, he really should be the anchor for the team.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-05-07T04:41:52.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed. Teams in OCE should be taught to think 'what is happening in the next minute or so?' and also have some set middlegame plays. That way they will become more proactive, but also more quicker to react because they will understand where the enemies are likely to be. If they can learn from SKT, one such thing is the quickness to react to crossmap plays and laning assignments. I would say that OCE is reasonably strong in laning in general, but the middlegame is a mystery. Dire Wolves tend to do the same things... Chippys in a side lane even if he is losing lane on a non carry pick. They could be thinking ahead and utilising him proactively, rather than falling into a rut (thinking of the Shen game).\n\nI noticed a cute middlegame play that SUP had - they were playing on red side and three of them were sieging mid tier 2 tower in one of the games, but realised that they were running out of minions, so they backed off into the bush near raptors. The other team thought they had left, so one of them was sent to farm the remaining creeps (i think it was the adc) and then walked elsewhere, but then when the minions came they had a readymade dive situation which resulted in a free tower - adc had to back off or die (unlike in soloqueue of course :P). Opposition team were not thinking ahead there. But the point is, they were all on the same page, and timing is crucial in league. By teams practising middlegame plays, they save a lot of time.\n\nOne coach that did this in OCE was Bencel. Sin gaming seriously outperformed themselves when he was coaching.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
