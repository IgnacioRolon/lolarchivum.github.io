I am having the same issue again where I am getting 200 ping at like 8pm at night. I am on fibre broadband so its pretty fast with 100mb download and 20mb upload. I use to have the issue on my old net when I got fixed with several back and forth emails to riot via their support which took 3 weeks if I remember. \r\n\r\nSO what I wanted to do was go back and visit the same problem and go step by step of the procedures that took 3 weeks of feedback  to solve my issue only to figure out the history had been wiped of my activities. Bear in mind the tickets include everything from my banned smurf accounts (active and inactive) (currently have no smurfs cause alot of time and effort went to waste with them getting banned over and over again), networking issues and client issues. So obviously since riot had the recent ban wave of accounts and alot of complains from people about randomly getting banned for no reason. My mind obviously jumped to the conclusion of, Did Riot legitimately screw up their banning procedure because they were going off incorrect evidence or flaws in system that was giving false reports to bans idk could be anything but it was their fault and they were trying to remove all evidence of any follow up tickets to claims of these incorrect bans. Obviously i dnt know why they would remove the activity history but removing issues regarding networking has no value but removing all these claims of false bans may somewhat be plausible as Riot may have gone wrong somewhere and were like we must sweep this under the rug and leave no record.\r\n\r\nOn however a side note- I still have 200 ping any one know how to fix it, fiber internet, brand new wiring in the house, gaming computer only a year old, Can search up stuff fine is just the ingame ping is 200. only delay i noticed was in champselect but even that could have been me being tired.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-18T10:26:56.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nFirst off, you should be able to access your previous tickets with no issues, if they're not visible on the website for some reason you should be able to view the history in your email account.
