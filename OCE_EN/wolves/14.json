Riot Thoughts?","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Remember this is just an option I am not asking to replace anything, Just and added feature on top of the ones we already have.\r\n\r\nRight so we know how its super difficult to get your hands on a Tournament Realm account and Riot do not give them out to everyone. Only OPL and OCS players i believe. Why not bring a function from the TR client that allows you to spectate in real time.\r\n\r\nThe potential benefits I could see:\r\nThe Tournament Scene:\r\n\r\nBasically allowing casters and tournament hosts to view and stream games in real time allowing for a better publicity than what the 3 minute delayed spectate does. \r\n\r\nCoaching and helping Team develop:\r\nThere are several benefits of this that would make the coaching life easier and if you have coached previously or have spectated a game while talking to a person you would understand the pain of a 3 minute delay.\r\n\r\nFirstly from the coaches perspective, you cannot in any way look to improve your teams communication while hearing their decisions in real time and watching the play being made 3 minutes later. It is very hard to solidify how much time they had to make that particular decision or how much planning went into it. \r\n\r\nSecondly it can be used as a tool to help aid teams into solidifying their decisions in certain parts of the game. With real time help with the coaches and analyst in a controlled environment that is. So preferably in house. No cheating please.\r\n\r\nAnother thing would be scrims:\r\n\r\nAs most teams would know by now not everyone can use TR so we sort of forced to use the normal client to scrim. Which basically means coaches have to either watch till the end than do review than setup next game. Which overall takes a minimum of 3 minutes to watch and 5 minutes to relay and 2 minute lobby setup totaling at a 10 minute in between match down time which in theory is pretty good but thats in a perfect world usually the wait is longer. With a no delay spectate mode only enabled for customs, basically means we take out 3 minutes entirely and use that time to initially discuss the game while it is fresh in the minds of players.\r\n\r\nSo what are your thoughts? Also any riot employees want to comment?","replies":[{"poster":"Chris2fur","date":"2016-06-24T23:05:04.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason there is a delay you should know this is because in online tournaments that are streamed it prevents players from looking at the stream and gaining an unfair information advantage. Generally speaking it will open you up to cheating quite easily. Think if a lower level team finally gets to scrim like a Legacy or Dire Wolves, obviously they want to look good and now it has become so easy to cheat all their coach would do would relay whats happening in game to the team. The feature you want for it to work without being able to be abused would need much more work put into it than simply having no delay. So then depends whats on Riots priority list because clearly a replay system or sandbox mode is not either.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolves","date":"2016-06-28T15:15:36.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they should at least give you the option to set it. The initial 3 minute was supposed to be ward timers i believe so enemy team couldnt spot wards. I mean it is very easy to find loop holes to cheat but streams do have an automatic delay even tho they are not long. Another thing is the option is only open to the people in the lobby and generally in games the coach is never in lobby. Plus people are very gullible so if you tell them there is a delay the sorta will assume there is a delay. Plus remember matches at quarter finals , semi's and finals are usually monitored by tournaments via the use of discord in voice coms. So if they organizers are well prepared they can spot cheating in progress. I mean any major event already does this so others can follow. Plus the system would be great for lan events wouldnt you say. To help smaller tournaments bloom.","replies":[]}]}]}
