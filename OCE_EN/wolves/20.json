But hear me out and relay your thoughts.\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/6d7dba6e7e07cbf051bab82bbc159a2f\n\nSo the only reason I am wanting a change and looking for a change is because our region is weak and the only way we make it better is if there is more competition to be number one and in this instance be safe and the rate it is going we will have a decent team by season 9 maybe 10 if league sticks around that long that is. Which is too long if we want our region to be recognized at a international level in my opinion (everyone is entitled to their own opinion)\n\nSo first up is \n**Oceanic Pro League (OPL)**\nThe top 4 teams in the opl are deemed safe\nThe Fifth , Sixth and Seventh Spot have to play a demotion match BO3 or BO5 against OCS teams\nThe Last placed team will instantly get demoted to OCS\n\n**Oceanic Challenger Series (OCS)**\nThe number 1 team will instantly get promoted into OPL\nThe Second , Third and Fourth teams will have to play a promotion match BO3 or BO5 against OPL teams (They are also considered safe)\nThe Fifth , Sixth and Seventh Spot have to play a demotion match BO3 or BO5 against OOL teams\nThe Last placed team will instantly get relegated out\n\n**Oceanic Open Ladder (OOL)**\nThe number 1 team will instantly get promoted into OCS\nThe Second , Third and Fourth teams will have to play a promotion match BO3 or BO5 against OCS teams \n\n**Thoughts on the format? Riot ? Influences?**\nBasically now I have created an entire chain of competition which maybe similar to an older format but I think which is what this region needs for a shot at worlds. Now the competition in OPL stems down to 12 teams instead of normally being 10 but in this instance not being as harsh as this. Same deal with OCS it now stems down to 8 teams instead of normally being 6 and competition is more fierce.\n\nI know this makes things very stressful and puts alot of pressure as teams are constantly trying to not get placed red and get out of yellow. But if your management and the team cannot handle the stress of pro plays why are you in it in the first place, is my way of looking at it. Step aside and let people through who are eager and willing to do it and can handle the stress and pressure.\n\n**How does it help new talent and teams:**\nMy thought process behind this is now there needs to be a good mixture of skill and synergy in order to compete as the top spot will always be up for contest since its a free ticket into the next level of competition.  Secondly placing top 4 is not bad at all anymore so the spot is highly contested in order to get a shot at promoting. Thirdly no one would want to be placed in the yellow zone so everyone would be competing for the top spots in order to keep their spot in the competition. Lastly no one would be wanting to get placed last as you instantly lose your spot.  So overall at every colour code there is more competition. \n\nAnother way riot could help is offering prize money for promoting. On top of prize money for being placed.\n\nI could be very wrong about this but this method in my head would allow 1 season maximum to get top level competition out of a joke of a region like ours. **Your move RIOT**","replies":[{"poster":"Squire Pug","date":"2016-07-24T10:33:15.232+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This will destroy OCE esports, for the very reason you think it might succeed.\n\nWe are needing organisations that support players, and provide the ancillary services like coaches, analysts, psychs, gaming houses.\n\nThis all takes money, and the main source of that is sponsors.\n\nNo sponsor will touch a team that is going to be relegated out of the main league, and so anything other than the top 4 teams will be starved of cash, and starved of the support structure to grow their players.\n\nThis has been looked at, and to be honest discarded for being extremely and fundamentally flawed.\n\nYou want something that works? Go Franchises, but with aggressive player trade movements. This allows good players to get into well funded and stable orgs.\n\nThis is already in motion, in part, and the stability it gives orgs, will see GOOD ORGS providing houses, support staff and a more stable environment to grow players.\n\nEvery other region is succeeding with this format, even the newest in Japan which is seeing success.","replies":[]},{"poster":"shotzz","date":"2016-07-06T06:39:02.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why fix something that is not broken?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wolves","date":"2016-07-06T04:41:12.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So not many people liked the instant Demotion concept. https://gyazo.com/7ff911664f6702908cb62d8497e2b757\nI think this format would be an adaptation of the one above","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wolves","date":"2016-07-06T01:33:09.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump","replies":[]}]}
