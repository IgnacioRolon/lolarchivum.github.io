Among these, Riot included a hypothetical scenario for an overall change of their Ranked system.","url":"http://www.12up.com/posts/3636993-riot-hints-at-complete-rework-of-ranked-system-in-season-7?a_aid=40727","image":"http://images1.minutemediacdn.com/production/1200x630/57b5def4c5d9a363b600000b.png"},"up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I want the Diamond, Master and Challenge queues to be together and separate from plat and below  \r\n\r\nBecause firstly its only 5%  of the community if we combine the 3 tiers.  I know queue times are longer. But I would seriously wait 30 minutes to play a intense match than wait 5 minutes to play a clown fiesta of a game or a feed fest cause I have a bunch of people who have no clue what they are doing.\r\n\r\nSecondly if you cross the threshold and make it to Diamond it should feel like an accomplishment and you get to feel the skill difference. Currently its where all the boosted animals end up and I swear half the time the level of play feels way worse than bronze level games. If you make it this far then the game should be going hey your not too bad at it but you lack some key skills and we will help you refine it by **making you play against better players**. I am being deadly serious here most people get a boost to Diamond and play one game of ranked a month to reap the rewards at the end of the season, I know since a bunch of my friends have done it. Make it so you have to have reached the rank on your own accords or else it would be near impossible for you to maintain it.\r\n\r\nThirdly I think they also should have a shorter inactivity period, say 14 days maybe less. Chances are if you dont play for more than 5 days you loose your edge so I dont know why we have such a long period before inactivity takes a hit.. Like a competitive queue where you have to play regularly to ensure you stay in the tier.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-08-20T12:10:03.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, **Riot Ghostcrawler** confirmed that next season will have some big changes on his [Ask.fm](http://ask.fm/RiotGhostcrawler/answers/140217432715).
