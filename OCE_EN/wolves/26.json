I am starting the vod review section of my videos so any feed back on the procedure and overall depth of the video is much appreciated.\r\n\r\nI will take it into consideration and improve it for my next video.","replies":[{"poster":"ChocoThunder","date":"2016-11-25T03:46:44.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey bud, glad you're putting in the effort to get your content out there! Not a lot of people will go as far so the extra effort to level yourself up will go quite a way.\n\nStart from pickban though. It's a good opportunity for you to flesh out and identify to the audience the intent behind both compositions and what you believe should be their goals going into the game.  It'll spill into the rest of the game quite well, as it'll give more direction to allow the audience a glimpse into your game knowledge and overall philosophy. In the video you're more or less criticizing micro points and commentating what's happening while not creating an overarching vision and projecting your ideal scenario and how it compares to the existing play. It'll take a bit of work since how you communicate it can mean the difference between a 35min vod to a 60 min vod.  I hope to see more videos or written work!","replies":[{"poster":"Wolves","date":"2016-12-13T03:25:28.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers, man just got back from holiday so will work on it.","replies":[]}]}]}
