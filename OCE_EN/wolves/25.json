Riot?","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember the hide all chat option in settings.\r\n\r\nCan we get a hide ally chat option as well. I know this isnt a top priority issue but I do enjoy peaceful non chatter games.\r\n\r\nI know there is the mute function but doing that every kinda gets daunting. And seeing a rage message kinda demoralizes you before you even mute them as you already know they are not happy with the game and know you have to try please this one guys so he wont afk in the next few minutes.\r\n\r\nThis would be a simply lifestyle change.\r\n\r\nI also tried physically hiding the chat but its a hindrance some times if you accidentally hit enter and forgot to hit it again to get out of chat box. You would be spamming abilities and nothing would go off until you hit enter again which to your surprise you would find an essay of random  QWER.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-11-01T03:04:02.917+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know, there's this amazing function already in-game that can do exactly what you want.\n\nIt's called \"mute\".","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-11-01T03:05:31.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Owned.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wolves","date":"2016-11-01T03:09:38.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wolves,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=HqEAujRa,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-11-01T03:01:49.258+0000)\n>\n> I know there is the mute function but doing that every kinda gets daunting.\n> This would be a simply lifestyle change.\n\n\nI did state it was a lifestyle change","replies":[]}]}
