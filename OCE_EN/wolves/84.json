Thoughts?","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"SO what I am after kinda compliments and tackles two points. \r\n\r\nQueue timers and Level of Play\r\n\r\nWith the new changes for season 7 you can both solo and dynamic queue. The queues are interlinked I believe until you reach diamond.\r\n\r\nAfter diamond it&#039;s only duo queue or solo unsure but I know master and challenger will be purely solo.\r\n\r\nThis change was so riot could get more people to sorta climb the ranks with aid while still recognise those who got there solo and those who dynamic queued.\r\n\r\nIts nice that riot is considering allowing both types of people play with interlocking queues but I wanted to propose something different.\r\n\r\nSo basically my idea is that why not give everyone standard lp gain and lose. Say 20lp gain with 10lp lose. This guarantees that people will progress through the ranks alot quicker **naturally** comparative to the system we have now. \r\n\r\nWhat riot is after is obviously getting more people at higher tiers so that its alot easier to grow the skill level. But i think my proposed strategy would work alot better. \r\nThe initial boost of players going out of bronze, silver and gold will be massive. Likelihood of playing better players would increase.\r\nWe would still be able to demote back from diamond and all at a much shorter rate. Inactivity period can be shortened due to the changes.\r\n\r\nHowever i know its alot like spoon feeding players.  You will still get outlier players who will be in bronze, silver and gold. Eg new players, casual players.\r\n\r\nPossible benefits is because its alot easier to climb you have no need for boosting rings so therefore they will be out of business. Queue timers shorter.\r\n\r\nMuch like how challenger has a 200 player limit it could now even be extended to 200 master lock so seemingly adding another element of competitiveness.\r\n\r\nIdk this just came to my head. Maybe I could have explained it a little better and alot more in depth but I am tired so just gonna blurb and see what others think.\r\n\r\nThoughts? Hate? Likes? Other Options?","replies":[{"poster":"Hideousbeast","date":"2016-10-23T08:14:49.407+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I like the idea, though I would extend it to be according to your skill within the game. \n\nFor example if you lose but get an S+ you will only lose 10lp, but a C+ would lose you 18. That way players that actually play well can be protected from losing too much lp from an unlucky team.\n\nIt could be done for a win too, where an S+ nets you 20lp but a B+ gives you 16.\n\nThat way a skilled player is going to climb without being held back.","replies":[]}]}
