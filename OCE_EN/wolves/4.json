So this is the psychology student in me that really likes taking on board experiments of this nature.\nPreviously I used to take bronze to silver players and transition them into gold and above and this had  some success to it and now I am gonna tackle bigger fish. \nThis will enable me to think more in depth about my field of study.\n\nThe second aspect of this will be me as an OCS coach wanting to further my understanding and to grow.  I want to review , revise and test my methods in order to find the most efficient and effective methods out there. This in turn will help me improve my coaching style as well as my overall approach to things. \n\nAnd the end result will hopefully make you one of the top tier players in the region. Now before i get into the requirements I want to let you know that I will be coaching OCS again next split therefore most of my effort and priorities will be putting that team first. This means this side project may get reduced number of visits from me. With that in mind I will be looking for self sufficient players that can function by doing task at hand\n\nSo a little explanation on how this will be run, I will be taking on board 10 players that will be cut down to 5 at the end of a 30 day trial period. Now when you start the experiments I will be giving you a consent form which is NOT legally binding so do not worry. It is more so to get consent from you that you are willing to participate on your own accord. As this is a psychology experiment of sorts. You will then be required to fulfill either daily or weekly task. They can be any thing from set number of games, to giving a break down of video assigned. More about that later also will be moved to a permanent contract later on. ( Bear in mind I am not getting any funding for this therefore I will not be paying you for your participation , just to make that clear). So Hard working or good work ethic is essential. Also bear in mind I am a coach not a miracle worker , your improvement comes from your efforts, I am just there for guidance and little nudges.\n\nRequirements: \nDiamond and above\nI am looking for people who will have the rest of this year free(2016) and potentially 2017.  Weekly Attendance is Compulsary\n( Explain your situation to me in an interview)\nMust have a strong drive to succeed, And understand the people there with them are doing the same\nGood work ethic, Somewhat mature (in the context of game play but outside of it anything goes)\nWorked in a team environment or understand how to do so.\nPeople who are non vulgar (toxic) in team coms or against teammates or the team atmosphere. (can ask me what I can tolerate)\nBasically take loses as a learning experience rather than using the blame finger.\nAges 18+ ( i can make exception if your 17 or 16 as long as your parents or caregiver gives consent)\nAlso do as you are told , I hate people that argue and more than likely will drop you from experiment.\n\n\nNow ways to contact me are either add me in game\nIGN : Wolves\nSkype: Ocewolves\nI also have ts3, Curse voice. Discord\n\nYou will have to do an interview as part of the selection process just so I can judge whether you meet the requirements or not\nI will update here on how many spots left: 10/10","replies":[{"poster":"Eyla","date":"2016-04-20T10:02:23.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Am I too late?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wolves","date":"2016-04-13T06:14:07.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"New update I will be doing interviews in the next couple of days , I do not have the minimum number I wanted but I will go forward anyway","replies":[]},{"poster":"ElevenXI","date":"2016-04-09T21:07:42.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey wolves,\n\nI just wanted to say that what you are doing is great, I wish you all the best.
