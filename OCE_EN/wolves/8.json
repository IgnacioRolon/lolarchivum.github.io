Are you going to do some more? Perhaps some topics could be:\n\n- Objectives Priorities (i.e. when to do dragon and when not to)\n- The differences between LCS and soloqueue (choosing champs, invading, level 1 stuff)\n- What to do when behind (e.g. your bot lane just lost their tower)\n\nI think these topics would be very handy for most players under platinum. From what I've seen out there OCE players really struggle with these.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolves","date":"2016-04-15T09:49:49.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cheers for your feed back I will see what I can do and hopefully a video maybe coming your way soon","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-04-10T19:17:24.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good video man, everyone under platinum should watch it.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolves","date":"2016-04-11T01:17:36.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks","replies":[]}]}]}
