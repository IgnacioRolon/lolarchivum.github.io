For Toxicity, account sharing and boosting.\r\n\r\nAssuming it would only be fair that they be allowed to play in OOL but not allowed to compete in OCS or OPL for the duration of their ban. Am I correct to assume this or am I in the wrong.?","replies":[{"poster":"ImperiusË†","date":"2017-02-14T06:25:24.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good idea. Players who breached the rules in the OCS should not be allowed to enter again, however they should still be able to compete in the Oceanic Open Ladder. I don't think there is anything wrong with that.\nOn a side note, I think it would be also good for Riot to conduct an investigation for the Top 8 Open Ladder teams who try and compete for the OCS Relegation Tournament, as they are most likely highly skilled players who could be boosting/account sharing/toxicity.","replies":[{"poster":"belquin","date":"2017-02-15T05:42:55.753+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We definitely would do the same checks for OOL players entering the OCS","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"belquin","date":"2017-02-15T05:44:49.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main thing that differentiates it is that OCS is semi-professional and OOL is amateur.
