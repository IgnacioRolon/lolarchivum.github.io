(that and it's arguable which is worth more between Inhib towers and inhibs in any given game.)","replies":[{"poster":"Wolves","date":"2016-04-18T07:26:00.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The video was supposed to be very generalized with a simple to understand list and brief pointers. Which took 18 min to do sorta, So imagine highlighting every aspect in every scenario, it would be very lengthy hence why I gave time stamps so people could skip to points they wanted to know about. \n\nI know there is a lot of things I could talk about but keep in mind this video is directed towards the majority of league community and its best to keep things simple. \n\nIt is good to know that you have some what  more understanding and knowledge base than the average players but keep in mind the majority of the players do not and nor do they have they skill to execute it and over time they will gain those skills but you have to start somewhere therefore the video was made for their benefit.\n\nApologies if my content isn't the best but than again you only watched 2 minutes of it so you probably wouldn't have heard all the content. But this is a guideline for them to work off to improve and I would not want to cause them confusion.","replies":[]}]}]}
