( 5 win streak would be 5 x positive 5 therefore a positive lp gain of 25 lp for that given game and vice versa for a lose )\r\n\r\nThirdly a cap of 10 times multiplier on both postive and negative. so max lp gain on a max multiplier would be 50lp per game. Where as for losing max lp lose would be 50 per game.\r\n\r\nFourthly putting a time limit on the multipliers and some form of restrictions i guess. Multipliers for winning will degrade 1 multiplier a day however upon losing you will lose all your multiplier stacks but for that losing game your lp lose will be zero (can be abused still thinking on what i could come up with) . Multiplier for losing will also degrade 1 multiplier a day however upon winning you will reduce your multiplier by two per win.\r\n\r\nThe fifth idea which I am still debating on whether it is an extreme or not, is mainly focused towards trolls, afkers and what not. So upon reaching a 10 lose multiplier your base lp lose is increased from 5 to 10 eg. 100 lp lose on a single lose after obtaining 10 times multiplier, this will mean you getting demoted a division each lose (great for people wanting to get to bronze 5 quick)\r\n\r\nThe series from division to division and from tier to tier will still remain. ( Challenger and master tier players will maintain a low lp gain per win and same for a lose.Tier demotion remains slightly the same if your 5 or above 5 on the negative multiplier you have no immunity to demotions.\r\n\r\nI still have some more ideas that I sorta forgot while i was writing this but comment on the validity, if it is practical or not, what things need to change whether or not the numbers are extreme same with the rewards and punishments.\r\n\r\nI took note from what people said about not being in the tier they are meant to be, weird team mates, and the infamous I want to have fun....... go play a dam normal. I guess it will put a more serious feel to ranked games with hopefully less likely hood of non rank worthy players and potentially increase the use of normal games to test out your adc maokai rather than my promos please.\r\n\r\nLastly the slow decay on multipliers are therefore people mostly that lose and keep playing to lose constantly it provides restraint and maybe help them make better judgements. if you lose two games chances are your gonna lose your next one so why not take a break. But however it does fuel the addicts to keep playing cause they do not want to lose their multipliers. so a win win xD\r\n\r\nAlso i forgot to mention the decay goes to 0 multiplier. But for a win you will receive 5lp cause its not times zero cause thats zero and I dn't want zero lp.\r\n\r\nHopefully the serious feel does not make everyone toxic when they are behind in game cause it will defy the purpose but yea.\r\n\r\nSo please leave a comment and tell me what you think about the idea for a change in the season 5 rank system.","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-12-05T14:42:08.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This just seems over complicated and unnecessary, and will diminish climbing if you have a few bad games due to the insane LP loss.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolves","date":"2014-12-06T01:41:42.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well the main reason behind the system is if you lose more than one it calls for a break. cause clearly if you lose the first two most likely your gonna lose the third. So this is focused on getting players out of ranked and into normal games to improve their character knowledge and decision making while the multiplier decreases and get back into it later. mind you if you lose a game on zero multiplier you only lose 5 lp so you dnt drop fast ifyou keep it at 0 multiplier\n\nThanks for the feed back please bump, really appreciate it getting comments all around","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DeeDab","date":"2014-12-06T00:34:30.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kind of complicated, not that its a terrible idea it would be unfair to someone stuck in low elo because of this system and then forum wars all over again. Cause whole division demotion based on one game? thats really harsh and i wouldnt want anywhere near that.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolves","date":"2014-12-06T01:38:49.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well i totally forgot about division demotions but i guess I could say a multiplier 5 or higher would have no immunity to demotion just like tier demotion so it will be worth waiting a day or two before you play. play some normals to improve your skills and  start your climb again.\n\nThanks for the feedback tho, really appreciate it","replies":[]}]}]}
