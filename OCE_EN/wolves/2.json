The only way I'm doing this is if I can have the respect of the players right off the bat, otherwise it's really a waste of my time. If that's all settled then I'd be glad to do it, I need a way to pass the time anyway.\n\nIf you're looking to recruit team members, I do wish to be on the higher end team (which I think is RA2). My positions are top, mid and ADC, only this time round I don't intend to be the team bitch, so if you seriously consider me, I won't play picks that I'm not comfortable on unless I'm told a day or so prior so I can learn their techs. If you remember me being a sub top/mid laner then good on you, if you remember me as being a good player, then you're now talking to a very different player. I'm no longer just good, I'm amazing, though I can't say that to myself seriously since I'm never satisfied with my current skill level, so I keep learning.\n\nAs for being a manger, all I need is a brief run down on the procedure and I can make this organisation nice and tidy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Codux","date":"2016-11-17T00:17:23.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In terms of organizing players does that include monitoring playtime/observing scrims etc?","replies":[{"poster":"Wolves","date":"2016-11-17T04:15:16.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Observing scrims is totally up to the manger generally they monitor their behaviour and atmosphere but since we arent in a gaming house or lan events for OOL its not necessary. However its easier to build player manager relationship if you show genuine interest in performance and assist in behaviour moderation as well as controlling mood and so forth","replies":[]}]}]}
