Or be declared their own region?","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"Big controversy Headline, Attention Seeking words Used.\n\nOkay let&#039;s get on with things.\n\nNow this may or may not split the community in half but it&#039;s a potential possibility for the future.\n\nNow I believe I am basing a lot of things solely of internet quality. And do keep in mind that Korea, Japan, China have servers in close vicinity.\n\nI know another attributing factor is **population** as well which I may or may not touch on.\n\nSo comparing the internet of NZ and AU you can clearly see that AU is fairly behind with their internet quality in terms of speed and stability.\nAu is has a fibre to the node plan which will still be roling out till early 2019 when from then on they will be using another massive grant to do fibre to the doorstep. Which will take another 2 years so you can have good fibre internet in AU by late 2021.\n\nComparative to NZ which has already has already been rolling out fibre to the doorstep which is scheduled to complete near early 2017 and it will be at least 5 years earlier than AU. They also have started to roll out 1 Gigabit internet plans. They named Dunedin the first Gigatown late last year and soon other major cities are to follow. Schedule change from 100 to 1000 mbps was from October 1st 2016 .\n\nNow I could have just made these numbers up which could be considered totally biased and one sided. But think of it this way if I remember newzealand can fit on australia about 23 and half times. If you compare this to scale of the project in australia and Nz one could assume that it would take 23 times as long to complete the same project in Australia.\n\nSo in my defense I think I was being fairly generous to AU in saying they would take only 5 more years to complete this project. In reality delays could push it back to almost 7 to 8 years and even more. Whereas NZ internet would be as good as Korea.\n\nSpeaking of Korea its a smaller country alongside China that has probably the fastest internet in the world and primarily for that is considered the gaming nation.\n\nWhat this could mean for us is essentially asia pacific if the servers were to be hosted in NZ or at least separate to AU it could be a boot camp region with pretty much could simulate the level of play in Korea. Also teams in asia pacific wouldnt have to travel half way arond the world to improve.\n\nI have a lot more to say but i&#039;m procrastinating so this will be all for now but still. I want to hear riots thoughts and the communities thoughts.\n\nEdit: \n**Tackling the Queue time issue:**\n\nNow I dont know the exact numbers in terms of population for Nz and Au, however looking at the ladder there are  221, 298 people playing ranked in total.\n\nMeaning there can be 22, 129 games if all of these guys are on. With the current logarithm for finding a match your queue time, would be exactly the same. Maybe better potentially worse if you are number 1 challenger but that's not new.\n\nSo here is an example at the time you play say 1am in the morning there are 100 chall players, 100 master , 100 dia, 100 plat and so forth. Say I remove the 99 players from challenger since moving to NZ. \n\nNow what will happen is we are going to see a general shift, 99 players from master move up to challenger, 99 from dia to master, 99 from plat to dia and so forth.\n\nSo really what will happen in theory is you will be placing with people lower than you but your queue times will somewhat remain unaffected.\n\n**The ping Issue:**\n\nNow imagine playing games with no lag or dc. Thats korea in a nutshell. Also imagine that throughout korea under 10 ping is what is considered average. 20 is considered playable above 50 is unplayed.\n\nNow ping or latency is determined by the distance or time it takes for you to send information from your pc to the servers and back.\n\nDue to NZ size a server located in say wellington means that the nation would not be even playing on anything over 20 ping. Dont believe me try internet speed test to Wellington.\n\nNZ is already underway to being one of the top countries in the world for internet. We can also become the boot camp region for the southern hemisphere. Now I am not going to tackle the political side and any other benefit outside of esports primarily.\n\nNow the game comes down to reaction time and individual play. Over time the level of skill on the server will improve just like it did in Japan.\n\nAlso there is no restriction on the server so it means people can play from AU, and Asia pacific. Or similar to how NA players play on EU.\n\nAlso right now for players right now if they wanted to pursue a career in esports they have to move to AU, sydney or melbourne in particular.\n","replies":[{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2016-10-05T03:49:43.680+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"no. neither country has the population to support their own server. ping also shouldn't be an issue in NZ considering that auckland is over 1000km closer to sydney than perth it.\nthere's no valid reason to have a server for each country, and it wouldn't be economically viable to have one for each country either.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHARSMELLZ","date":"2016-10-05T08:37:18.770+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cyrater","date":"2016-10-05T07:10:10.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of people already have fibre in Australia, that thing about people having in in 2021 is pure bullshit","replies":[{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2016-10-05T07:37:38.182+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cyrater,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=q50ONjTM,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-10-05T07:10:10.810+0000)\n>\n> A lot of people already have fibre in Australia, that thing about people having in in 2021 is pure bullshit\n\nno they don't. you don't know what the fuck you're talking about m8. just cause a lot of people around you have it doesn't mean a lot of people across australia have it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-10-05T07:38:41.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Define \"a lot\", because as far as I'm aware it's currently only available in rural towns, not in any cities (small or large).","replies":[{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2016-10-05T10:45:52.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=q50ONjTM,comment-id=00020001,timestamp=2016-10-05T07:38:41.071+0000)\n>\n> Define &quot;a lot&quot;, because as far as I&#x27;m aware it&#x27;s currently only available in rural towns, not in any cities (small or large).\n\nit's available in some parts of sydney iirc.\nit wasn't available in any of the rural towns around me until july this year, and even then the ones that have it, only some parts have fibre to the node and others have wireless nbn.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Siva Ellen Pinoy","date":"2016-10-05T08:41:18.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can confirm, i live next to the cbd of sydney and we still don't have nbn installed","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ultralight Beam","date":"2016-10-05T03:36:07.841+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd rather not to be honest.

Australia might do fine but you forget that New Zealand has only 4million people!  And of course this means the majority of the 220k people in ranked are australian, so that means having a seperate server for New Zealanders and Australians would cause 20 minute queue times just to play a normal game in NZ. This is also a disaster because you forget about people in tropic islands like people in fiji where are they going to go???","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wolves","date":"2016-10-05T08:17:18.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried to tackle the Queue time issue and how the population numbers arent going to be affecting activity time as much.","replies":[]}]}
