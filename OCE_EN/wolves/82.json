Having a break week between tournaments gave teams time  to develop and better themselves.\nSimilar thing for OCS but i would have liked it if it was a two day event like OPL with the same match format, I may have said this previously but saying it again.\n\nBefore I make a move stating what they could have done better I want to point out that OPL/OCS promotion matches will not affect worlds in any way. As it will not concern the top team of the region.\nI also know it could affect scrim schedule to a degree with OCS not able to get OPL scrims if they are on a delayed start and this applies to OOL too.\nI also want to point out that alot of the time OOL and even OCS starts of in the middle or before final exams starts for uni students. \nAlso patch favors some players over others but its near balanced since you can pretty much play most champs based on situations.\n\nMy biggest issue is with the start of Split two of OOL and OCS none of these two tournaments affect anything internationally and if your looking to get new talented teams into the scene. \n\nFirst off having a bigger rest period inbetween say starting late July and early to late August instead of the current start we had of June 11th 2016 which is less then two months after split one ended 16th April 2016. \nThis is a concern to me as first of players that have played in split one are burnt out already and usually need a good break period to rekindle the flame and obviously get over the depressive state of mind after not making it to OCS. Same with OPL promotion\n\nThe players havent had proper time to actually focus on studies (and other life commitments). I know the break in between is two months but teams start trialing players a month out and sometimes even sooner.  If we delay this process a couple more months it means teams are now not put together over night. Organisations have time to build up a strong and proper roster with properly driven and conditioned players. Meaning the level of play we get is obviously better from the start of OOL/OCS rather than as they progress. \n\nRiot Games Oceania should already know that oceania as as region even though we have pro players or what not its not a full time paying job and most have other commitments and bring it down to OCS and OOL level people wont be as obliged unless they have the time to put effort in and they know they have a definite shot.\n\nWhat I am saying is directed at OOL is that they can delay it till later on in the year. \n-Players get their break, \n-Teams get time to practice and grow before split two starts\n-They generally dont have to give up anything as its Holidays or first couple of weeks of school or Uni which it normally ends up being.\n-A bigger turnout to the tournament. Larger number of teams\n-Better level of teams competing and not just the team that could adapt and function as a team first\n-Also give s time for proper management training eg, managers, coaches, analyst and many more\n\nIt also makes the scene feel not as empty and pump out content after OPL is done. As usually there is a 5 month break for end of season and before next season kicks off for both OCS and OOL including OPL unless you get knocked out early than the wait extended to 7 months which is over half a year. We overall end up not loosing the competitive edge i should say. \n\nThe next issue which is obviously the OPL relegation matches are delayed till later on meaning that these teams are sort of kept on for a little longer as they are waiting for OCS to end but at the same time there is more time to prepare.\n\nTo aid consistent Teams in OOL https://gyazo.com/8323424b03426eaedc77cbd41621fca9\n( I will add more it was just a spur of the moment thought that popped into my head so will update it when I wake up, I have more to say)","replies":[{"poster":"RUSTYtheCASTER","date":"2016-07-26T04:34:05.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man thanks for the constructive feedback, information like this is always appreciated!\n\nSo firstly, I'm the person in charge of running the OOL league and ensuring it succeeds, past that I also try to prepare our OOL winners for the OCS through league structure etc! From this viewpoint I will try and address what I can of your concerns or options to better the league.\n\n> The OOL is timed with uni exams\n\nIt's unfortunate that this does coincide, and unfortunately it wasn't something I took too far into account for timing and dates of the league. I was actually trying to time the league with the OCS end dates, to allow seemless transitions from OOL --> OCS --> OPL!\n\n> My biggest issue is with the start of Split two of OOL and OCS none of these two tournaments affect anything internationally and if your looking to get new talented teams into the scene.\n\nYou know what? I agree with this too! It sucks that the leagues can be considered strictly domestic. The OPL is purposed to be the end game for the OOL/OCS, but the OCS is also designed to be a wanted outcome for the OOL teams. If there were an immediate win available, things could be seen differently.\nNot leading anywhere internationally could prevent teams from wanting to sign up, which could be inferred as less \"quality\" of competition available which is fair. Realistically though, teams should be competing to win and make it towards the next stepping stone locally, on the journey to worlds. My biggest gripe with this and something I'm sure you'd appreciate alongside me is that it takes a full year to get from OOL to OPL if you win everything. That's a long time.\n\n>Having a bigger rest period inbetween say starting late July and early to late August instead of the current start we had of June 11th 2016 which is less then two months after split one ended 16th April 2016.\n\nThis is also fair, but as mentioned above it's sculpted to have a smooth transition with dates to the OPL/OCS. So lets dive a bit deeper into the further problems you mentioned aligning with this!\n\n**- Players get their break**\nBringing this back to the 2 months break you mentioned could seem short in perspective for organisations, but 2 months is quite a substantial downtime! Realistically I'd like to be able to extend the length of the league, so that you can compete where available and still be able to grow/progress as the split continues. \nPlayers should always have a break for mental fortitude, I agree. The break week is designed to cater for all people, those who work weekends and those who study, even those in school to give them a weekend free! \n\n**-Teams get time to practice and grow before split two starts**\nAlso a great pain point that may well ring true, but to realign you with my initial intention, I'd like for a league to be prolonged further so that the OOL can be a practice and competition point all-together. It's a tournament series designed so that the consistent teams will qualify, which sets up the best competition possible for the OCS.\n\n**-They generally dont have to give up anything as its Holidays or first couple of weeks of school or Uni which it normally ends up being.**\nCoinciding tournaments with holidays/avoiding uni schedules is a massive pain to be able to organise or do. Pushing back the start dates may cater to this, to a certain extent, but ultimately it's an unavoidable fate that all competitors will have throughout the 1st split as well as the 2nd. I'd like to hope that players can work around this, but sometimes it ultimately just isn't possible and that sucks. In future I will do my absolute best to consider schedules for School & University though.\n\n**-A bigger turnout to the tournament. Larger number of teams**\nPutting the tournament later in the year may have a larger number of teams due to the above points, but realistically it shouldn't be affected all that much for signups. The biggest concern regarding this for me is the duration being only 4 regular season weeks, followed by a 5th invitational. That's not a lot of play or practice at all! Signup's have organically reduced throughout the splits either way as well.\n\n**-Better level of teams competing and not just the team that could adapt and function as a team first**\nThis is also reasonably possible, but ultimately isn't a deciding factor, moreso the cherry on top if it were proven to be true.\n\n**-Also gives time for proper management training eg, managers, coaches, analyst and many more**\nAgain I'd like to highlight that the training aspects are something I'm definitely not in control of, I'd like to believe that competing with the training being utilized levels everybody up quicker than otherwise! The break between was definitely quite short, proper management training periods is not a goal of mine with the OOL broadcast, it's to provide that consistent availability of competition.\n\nAs for the 5 month break afterwards, this is a big pain point for everybody involved or wanting to be involved in Oceanic esports. This is where I look to our community and hope something can be put together in it's stead of unavailability. I also do believe that's an incredibly large void not covered, even coinciding with holidays from **all** forms of study!\n\nThese were some interesting and fantastic points you've raised, I do hope I was able to provide some insight on your concerns and highlight why some good idea's haven't be used just yet. I basically just want the OOL to succeed, and for every player, teams and organisation within the OOL to succeed with it.\n\nCheers,\n\nRusty.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolves","date":"2016-07-26T07:56:20.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A big thanks Rusty for commenting and sharing your view points. \n\n**Exam Times**\nThe exams was a massive issue as near week 4 of OOL i had a bunch of players messaging or adding me who were now available to play that were unable to when I was scouting players which led to the post.\n\n**University Tournament** (something riot may need to change the dates for too.)\nSomething I forgot to mention too was The University Championship. or the tournament that was also run which I dont believe you are apart of that did also overlap OOL as some of the players from my teams competed in it which would be the same for other teams. It eventually ended up taking over practice time and obviously playing with another set of players changes your overall play-style and conditioning.\n\n**Transition**\nWith regards to the transition from OOL to OCS and OCS to OPL. If we were to shift the dates only the top two teams will have to change their schedule and that is if they win the promotion match to OCS. The remaining 6 in OCS plus the OOL teams would still function with the adjusted times properly as both the leagues will be around the same time if we were to change the start dates that is. If we look at OPL right now with no disrespect to Hellion the rest of the teams are pretty solid and on par of one another. Hellions will likely get knocked out this split and sin will still retain a team in OPL and OCS regardless. So only one team if they beat hellions that is, are going to move up so there which isnt really a big transition more an adjusted schedule as the players already play best of 3 formats in scrims and OCS and OPL both start from 6 or 7pm onwards. So only ever two teams will be affected if we change the dates. Also I wanted to add that a proper transition from OCS to OPL will be using the same two day format for OCS that OPL uses\n\n**Break Time**\n So I am going to use a little info from my major which is psychology to aid with my point of view which may sound a little dark but true. So every living person goes through depression at some stage in life. Teenagers are more prone and suffer from different levels being minor to major depression. Depression usually last 3 to 4 months if its minor and is triggered by negative outcomes. In this case say a player was unable to make split one of OCS he enters minor depression due to his hard work and effort he put in. He quits the game, takes a 3 month break comes back and starts to play league again and wishes to pursue his initials goals of making OCS or OPL but turns out by the time he returns all refreshed it pretty much is 3/4 of the way through OOL or OCS and he has missed his opportunity. In oceania we have standard gameplay coaches but I could be wrong here but there are no sport psychology coaches and other support staff that take physical and mental health into consideration like other regions.  (With this tho I am actually doing something about it to help facilitate things with my very own **Project Gateway** that will help with this and is going to launch later on this year, a little late but still necessary.)\n\n**Consistent Teams**\nI have two conditions that may or may not impact your view point. The first condition is having better players overall. So say a couple of teams had really good players out of solo queue and obviously being better they would consistently be placed higher in tournaments in the OOL tournaments and would end up being the ones to qualify. Now say if we implement the delay and now the teams that arent as good are able to strategies and adapt their game play against these teams to either end up on top or give them a run for their money. Eventually the skill level would improve and they will over throw these \"consistent teams\".\n\nAnother one is say a team ran an unorthodox comp and they had 4 champs each therefore they cannot get banned out. But teams were unable to devise a comp  that would eventually end up beating said since may the players had been playing together for a year and their synergy level is higher that the currently formed teams. But if we had the synergy due to more time before the start of second split then obviously it would come down to who works together as a team rather than just a comp being weirdly better.\n\nThese are all hypothetical and somewhat unrealistic, I have more but I believe you get the idea. Its pretty much whether you want a there to be strategy and other factors involved or would you rather just a better bunch of players in their own respect to make it through but have no understanding the level of strategy and gameplay aka solo queue game with coms.\n\n**Conclusion and things to consider for next split**\n\nExam Timetable: Should be taken into consideration most university and school are usually a week or two apart and at most a month. It is valuable to giving everyone an opportunity to compete. \n\nUniversity Tournament: Try not to overlap tournaments as it firstly impacts the turnout and practice time for someone looking to compete in both. If anything having them one after another as an inbetween tournament or off season tournament so teams that stick around can continue on to next split.\n\nTransition: will impact minority and will be a change in schedule more than anything. A proper transition training would be having OCS in the same OPL two day format\n\nBreak Time: Very essential from a psychological and tactical point of view and would be best for the scene to have a longer break time between splits since no impact internationally or to OPL or OCS because the next split will be split one of next year.\n\nConsistent Teams: It probably intertwines with break time but its a choice of whether you want a team that has strategy , gameplay and communication to go through that has time, and chances are will improve in skill or would you rather a bunch of good players who have none of the above. (teaching an old dog new tricks would be the perfect fit)\n\nThere is potential for OOL to be better organised and harbor better talent than OPL (not joking, the diversity of skill isnt that high in oceanic)  if you just let them. I believe it is time for the next generation to rise. \n\nAs always Rusty cheers for commenting you tend to leave your feedback on most of my rant post. I am just looking at advancing the scene without causing inflation. We are hitting a point where we could be called a stable region with a shot at worlds I am just trying to nudge things into the right direction. Eager to hear back from you. Hopefully this helps and you did a wonderful job running this split of OOL.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wolves","date":"2016-07-29T07:51:21.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another thing I just thought of about consistency is if we ran a format like this.\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zh50I3LxGJet5fq9t_-0xEYQo4sJtgFMITrfNOkFpW8/edit?usp=sharing","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wolves","date":"2016-07-26T15:04:32.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also feel free to comment if you guys have your own thought on whether or not it would be beneficial and the things to consider for next split.","replies":[]}]}
