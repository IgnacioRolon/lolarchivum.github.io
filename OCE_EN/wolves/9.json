The initial interaction I got was ekko was not healed by wish as he was ulting. Does he become untargettable? Should the wish be applied after he has finished casting ult. Like master yis alpha strike I think.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Qoki","date":"2016-08-16T07:51:46.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play a majority of my games as a Soraka support so I hope that I can help you out with this; \n\n\"Does he become untargettable?\"\n\nYeah Ekko does but for like half a second, but still he should've been healed by the Ult; as it also heals people who are untargettable (i.e. under the influence of a {{item:3157}}. The W heal is pretty much the only one of her heals that shouldn't be able to heal your team-mate in an ekko ult as its a target-able heal ability for better or worse. \n\nI haven't tried using the ult at the same time as Ekko's but when you use Soraka's ult is super situational to whether or not the support thinks that 1) you need the heal ASAP otherwise you'll die (if you're going to die regardless then the Raka shouldn't ult full stop) or 2) You need the extra HP to win the trade. In Case 1 I'd use the heal before Ekko Ults, if you can predict that and in case 2 you'd use it after or before.\n\nGist is though, it should've healed - sucks if it didn't.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-16T08:05:06.314+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"technically if she picked the exact wrong moment to ult this could happen for the same reason you can't stack wish with guardian angel, zilean ult or vlad pool, ekko's ult actually takes him off the map for a split second whilst reestablishing his hp and so the wish could be blocked as well as the heal summoner. Interesting note since zilean ult counts as a buff, ekko can be revived after, before or during his chronobreak though sometimes the hp won't stack even though it should. I've seen the same thing happen with shaco's ult making soraka wish miss as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Qoki","date":"2016-08-16T09:32:58.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good points","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-16T07:04:10.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont know about other champions, but Vladimir is not healed by her ult when he is in his pool\n\nTbh i think its fair, any champion that has untargetability already has a pretty solid advantage.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-16T08:01:35.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah you are right, though some exceptions do exist like fizz's trollpoll. People being revived by a jungle zilean also cannot be healed by soraka wish whilst in stasis and the same goes for shaco whilst shaco ults. Vladimir can actually take burn damage whilst in ult form though.","replies":[]}]}]}
