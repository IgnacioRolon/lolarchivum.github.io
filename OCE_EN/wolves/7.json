Basically riot is taking onboard the NA demotion/promotion style from LCS to Challenger series. \r\nThis means the bottom 3 teams are under threat of elimination however only two team will promote and demote.\r\n\r\n(More about that from riot&#039;s official release)","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-01-17T06:00:23.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering that teams will be located in Sydney because of the new LAN conditions, the standard of play should be higher than last season, with the teams being able to bond and train on a more frequent basis. Looking forward to the splits this season!\n\n**1. Chiefs.** The most stable roster that however still has serious weaknesses when it comes to facing international teams (on a macro level). However every position on the roster is class and they still have the phenomenom that is Swiffer. The effect on the changes to coaching staff remains to be seen. Things to watch out for this split: Swip3er's teleports to bot lane.\n\n**2. Dire Wolves. ** Would have to position these guys second, not just because of the bootcamping in Korea, but the experience and depth in their ranks. The addition and substitute of Shernfire will give the entire team a boost. Destiny as the new support brings a lot of experience and a level head to the bot lane. Will k1ng recapture his glorious form of 2015? Its certainly comes down to them to see if they can challenge the Chiefs to win the split. Things to watch out for this split: Shernfire substituting in games, and Chippy's Irelia.\n\n**3. Sin Gaming. ** I would have to say I'm little biased because Bencel is coaching, but these guys could definitely pull some surprises. Having a strong top laner has been crucial in previous OPL splits and SIN has done well to pick up Flaresz in the off season. Juves was a vastly improved player last year, so it will come down to whether the bot lane can step it up. Things to watch out for this split: Solo kills in mid lane.\n\n**4. Legacy.** Ever the bridesmaids, Legacy have made some changes this split, preferring to let ChuChuz go in favour of Claire, who just has to be given a chance on a starting roster somewhere! Will need to put in some serious bonding and training hours to get things right before the split starts though however. In my opinion the adc (Lost) is a touch over-rated (Raydere is still the best in OCE, despite retiring!) and bot lane will need to make improvements to their play for Legacy to challenge at the top. Things to watch out for this split: siege comps with heavy Cassiopeia play.\n\n**5. Avant Garde.** Amazingly made the semifinals last split of 2016, and the roster changes look interesting. Will depend a lot on whether Ceres can handle the heat in the top lane, but the addition of the players bonding together in the same city should do these guys wonders. Having said that, this split could also depend on the skillset of the adc (Blinky) with the current meta not seeming to favour his champion pool. Things to watch out for: Support roaming to mid lane to aid with a classic Chelby wombo combo.\n\n**6. Tainted Minds.** A largely changed roster with a couple of foreign imports and a foreign coach mean that this split could be great, or hard going for this squad. If the mercurial ChuChuz can find his form of the past (Syndra bans anyone?) then this will go a long way to improving the team's chances on the ladder. However judging from other sources suggests that they may struggle in both the top and bot lanes. Things to watch out for: substitute Pabu being given a chance on the big stage in the top lane.\n\n**7. Abyss eSports.** A couple of changes to this squad, with former Dire Wolves/Legacy support Cuden being the addition to the bot lane. With the ever solid Pacman marshalling things around the top side of the map, it really comes down to whether Seb in the jungle can make the plays and also if Frae (who has a good macro brain on his head) can re-adjust to playing mid lane. Certainly he will have more time to do so now that he does not have to micro manage in the adc role. However the current meta does not favour the classic Abyss late game scaling type of system that they used to some success in the previous split so I think they will struggle overall. Things to watch out for: Meta-breaking picks in the bot lane.\n\n**8. Exile 5.** As with a lot of teams stepping up to a new league, players have come and gone by the wayside which will really hurt this squad's chances this split. Should struggle in all phases of the game, with perhaps the mid laner being able to soak up most of the pressure from the other teams. Unfortunately there has to be a squad in 8th place and this looks the weakest of them so far. Things to watch out for: the return of Blitzcrank in games of a dead rubber nature.","replies":[{"poster":"belquin","date":"2017-01-18T04:31:55.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you are right - being able to train / live together should definitely result in a higher level of play.\n\nI'm also so excited to have all the teams playing live too - do you think this will help improve our teams composure when they get the chance to compete on the world stage?","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-01-19T01:57:08.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely will.
