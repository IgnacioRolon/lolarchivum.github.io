Riot?","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Over the years we have had soft resets that allow players of high rank stay high up and low ranks stay below.  Which is fine and should be that way.\r\n\r\nBut it got me thinking, i have seen some really good players that are stuck down in low tier and some really bad players who have been up in the high elo that is very hard to comprehend why they are there. But since the Legacy Client is going to be released it could be a very big but also once in a life time opportunity to reset the Elo systems.\r\n\r\nThe repercussions could be very massive but I think it will also balance things out a little. Wouldnt you agree?\r\n\r\nI know that regular league players would benefit more from the once a while players that are good too. But would it be something that be good for the scene overall?\r\n\r\nI have a whole bunch of ideas stemming from new youth and talent could flourish and get opportunity to grow with better players.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts? Anyone from riot Care to comment?","replies":[]}
