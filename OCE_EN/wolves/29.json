Maraudar where you at?","subforum":"Esports","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am gonna keep this short as I would like to hear other peoples thoughts on the matter. Usually, you have 10 teams because the region is well established with organisations that are stable and can back their players well and have a really good infrastructure to support them.\n\nBut in saying this Oceania as a whole is very new and organisation that aren&#039;t in the top 4 or 5 are still trying to stabalise in OPL. The reason why I say we need 10 teams or should look to having 10 teams is firstly from the organisation stand point. Putting two more teams into OPL creates a so called safe zone in the middle. This zone is like a stability mat for teams as the risk of relegations is still what prevents most sponsors from investing heavily in the financial side of things. This leads to restrictions on income that will eventually have an impact on player income thresholds. (Riot do pay players but organisations are obliged to put in their income on top of riot salary)\n\nThe next is the fact that we still have a large distinction between pro and semi pro. Pro players play full time  (OPL) and semi pro players play part time (OCS). What I am trying to get at here is that OPL only has a distinct 40 player pool that hasn&#039;t really changed much from split to split. A couple of retired players here and there but ultimately the players that were in OPL have stayed in OPL and there isn&#039;t any new flavour. More so it&#039;s the same group of players just in a different combination of teams. Don&#039;t get me wrong these players are exceptional in their own regards but the quality of gameplay is never the less same every split. No new players are kinda brought in due to firstly teams not wanting to risk an entirely new lineup, therefore, they stick with the current pool of players and the fact that because there are only 40 spots and unless players retire there isnt really an opening. \n\nAn increase in teams from 8 to 10 is just going to open up a minimum of 10 new player spots, with the added benefit of 10 new players into the pro status allowing them to play full time. Now I am not saying this is going to be a saving grace to boost Oceania to winning worlds but it&#039;s a step that could spark more competition at the lower end of the brackets as it will be a battle of being the two safe teams rather than already accepting your fate as bottom 3 relegation team. Eventually, the level of play will increase to the point where bottom teams will contest a spot in top 5 and 4. \n\nIn conclusion: \nThe introduction 2 new teams into OPL to make it a 10 team League. \nThis will introduce 10 new players into the constant 40 players we have seen split by split. \nMore full-time pro players in the scene.\n6th and 7th spot safe from relegation (More competition on bottom end of the teams to get this spot for stability)\nNew talent rotation\n\nImplication:\nRiot Oceania Budget\nHaving to run a 4 day twitch stream instead of 3. Thursday OCS, Friday OPL, Saturday OPL and Sunday OPL or Friday to Monday\nStaff\n\nIn my opinion, you will still see instability with the bottom 3 teams always due to relegations but with the 10 team you would have potentially established two new organisations for OPL.  @Riot if you need someone to manage all this or get it in order, I will be waiting for my employee acceptance letter {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Jason","date":"2017-08-24T16:13:28.105+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, Riot is in no state currently to implement these changes.\n\nWhile there is a current pro roster of approximately 40 players, there is also substitutes, and in some special cases, coaches who are also adept at the game, and while there is a distinct difference between a part time player and a full time player, opening up the league to 2 more teams is only going to extend the amount of people in one distinct group, rather than working at closing the gap in a more meaningful way.\n\nLet's look at some numbers. Australian teams have a large following when it comes to fan bases, however that doesn't really transition over to broadcast numbers themselves. Riot's production budget for the OPL is immense, and it's showing in their growth, however due to the scene not being marketed to international audiences very effectively, 90%+ fans are from Australia and New Zealand, and because we have such a low populus to begin with, the numbers just aren't there.\n\nAdditionally, Riot's production facility in Sydney isn't just used for the OPL, but also other regions including the LPL, LMS ( I think? dunno ) and a lot of international tournaments, handling the English broadcasts. Adding an additional day a week to broadcast is going to put a strain on the facility, the talent, AND the viewers. Viewers barely turn up to both days of the OPL, focusing mainly on watching one specific matchup a week, and whatever else they catch unintentionally. \n\nI think that Riot would absolutely want to get another 2 teams competing in the OPL, however the current attention of Riot Oceania has been moreso focused on the legitimacy of Esports as a business investment, and marketing the concept as a whole to large scale investors ( Dire Wolves say thanks ) or to traditional sporting organizations ( Legacy says thanks ). The next goals for Riot are apparently to increase team funding, so that teams can hire more support staff, such as social media managers, video editors, marketing / PR managers, and other niche things such as player psychology experts, and personal trainers and health instructors.\n\nI've only seen a peak behind the curtain through friends in both teams and at Riot, and there is a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes, and with most choices they make, they usually know what they're doing. ( Don't get me wrong, I do have some critical feedback, but I also do lack a lot of insider information that'd possibly explain their decision making in some choices )\n\nRiot is building stability, and looking at some big plans in the coming years. All you can do is trust they're exploring options ( especially ones such as the 10 team format, which has worked wonderfully for large scale regions ) and await the big things to come.\n\nHope that helps explain some :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"belquin","date":"2017-08-27T23:25:25.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of good points in here by Implosion and Jason. Its definitely something to consider at some point in the future, but as you guys have both pointed out there are a number of considerations before we make a change like that, so I certainly wouldn't be expecting it any time soon :p","replies":[]}]}
