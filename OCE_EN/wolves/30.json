Competitive rulings on behaviour, cheating , unsportsmanlike conduct, breach of contract and so forth. \r\n\r\nI think that applies to OPL and OCS as players sign a contract to Riot in those leagues.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if they were looking to do that in Oceanic Open Ladder as contracts are becoming more prevalent in that league.\r\n\r\nCould I potentially hear back from someone to whether or not this would be a possibility.\r\nOr has riot just not considered it yet.?","replies":[{"poster":"belquin","date":"2017-02-07T02:33:18.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Wolves,\n\nWe still have a way to go on leveling up player contracts.. Currently though, the OOL is pretty much out of the question for the foreseeable future.
