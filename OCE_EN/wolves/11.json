These are my OPINIONS from my point of view and the organisations that I mention are only due to them being the only ones who can change these circumstances as the largest influencer for the region. Also I do not work at Riot Oceania or EsL I cannot say what goes on in the behind the scenes and what resource allocation there is but anyway here are reasons why I hate the Oceanic Competitve integrity plus other things. Apologies for the long READ.\n\nFirst and foremost I want to start off with how esl ran the oceanic challenger series and im pretty sure this is how the tournaments are run for opl matches too. So you get points per game you win. In my opinion we should adapt the LPL format. They play two games weekly against the same team. You get points based on whether you win both , draw or lose. So now I am elaborating why we should really adapt this format. Firstly the players- since esl is streaming this why not dedicate more days, as you all know our region is the least grossing viewer for riots twitch channel. Give these players more time under the spot light. This means they get accustomed competitive play. This will inturn increase our time on air therefore increasing the viewership.\nAnother reason for adapting this format, and speaking from experience here is it would avoid ESL changing the rules last minute to throw teams off balance and give others the upper hand. (Like we had in split one of OCS).  This also increase peoples interest in the scene as well as the game meaning potentially open up slots for caster and more tech people to back it up. Obviously I do not know how much funds are allocated to pay the support staff , casting crew and other officials but I am addressing what I think is the best option.\n\nSecondly I think there should be more tournaments inbetween splits (I think riot has some rules against pro teams unable to play in other tourneys, which they need to change not sure tho). These tournaments should be an invitational type tournament with a mixture of top 4 OPL teams vs the Top 4 OCS teams. (Another thought process for this would be letting in other teams in OOL just for scouting purposes.) The main reason behind this is to set the pace and test the waters. The scenario will go something like this, a pro team vs a challenger team, obvious loss but potential for upset is there. Challenger teams get a taste of what it takes to be in a pro team and what pace they need to play the game at to be able to compete with them. So what happens now teams go back to the own splits and now they mimic the level of play from the in between splits tourny. So the overall level of play for OCS goes up. This means the two teams that play promotional matches wont just be good enough to beat the bottom two teams in OPL they come out of OCS potentially contending for the middle spots and maybe even the top spot. This cycle will need to go on for at least two season before we start seeing improvements level but the effects will be seen as soon as we implement it. This also a derivative from the Kespa cup, the koreans were intelligent enough to see this as the only way to improve their region to the best in such a short time and its about high time oceania developed (Riot Games Oceania) a brain and thought about the benefits for the region in the short and long run. I do not know if they have extra funds they can bring in or not.\n\nThirdly this is somewhat tackling the same issue stated above but in a different way , more behind the scene action. So as we all know teams scrim teams for practice and basically what I am proposing that there be a rule that pro teams have to dedicate two scrims games a week , maybe three if they are generous to challenger teams. (the teams also need to change from week to week, they get their pick but it cannot be the same team that they scrimmed last week). So the scenario plays out somewhat similarly but the impact is much faster. Challenger teams get a chance to scrim OPL teams and play at their pace on a weekly basis through out their split. Meaning overall level of play goes up much more rapidly, Therefore level of play for OCS goes up and the teams that come out of OCS are already accustomed to that type of play meaning. The level of play for OPL goes up since the Pro teams helped build a worthy foe worth taking down. The level of play for OCS and OPL becomes the same for fierce competition overall. Compulsory action which will not hurts riots deep pockets but will help the scene overall.\n\nOne major issue are the organisations themselves. There are four power house organisations that have solidified their spots in the top spots for OPL. I know for a fact it is a business and they will not like my ideology because the three points I stated above jeopardizes their income. But the thing is why is riot concerned about organisations, Riot Games Oceania should be concerned about making this region a contender for WORLDS. Those three Solutions if implemented  will intern open up doors for other organisations to come into the esports seen.  Because right now the situation with our seen is that the top 4 Organisations currently hold the top 20 best players in the oceanic scene, and if there is no up and coming new talents history will just repeat itself , the orgs will remain at the top and the region will not improve. They will qualify for WILDCARDS and we will LOSE. I am calling it here and now. 4/04/16. \n\nRiot and Other influences Please do something to help our region, please take this momment to reflect, regions like LMS, JAPAN, TURKEY AND RUSSIA are already surpassing us with pure talent and great level of game play. and in the odd scenario we get in because riot changed the number of seats we get we will forever be the laughing stock of a region which is something we can easily avoid if we were intelligent enough that is. So before the next season start. take this time to reflect on the competitive integrity of the region and ways on improving it drastically. I hate the way things are now and I want it to improve.\n\nAlso ADMINS please read and if in violation you can remove , but please read all the content as it took ages to write I am not attacking riot I am just addressing them firmly , I mean them no disrespect nor Do I mean any disrespect to the brains behind it as well as the organisations. \n\nPlease do take time to read and Comment on your thoughts and other ways we can improve the competitive integrity for our region, I know my english is not the best but I hope i conveyed my ideas the best I could. \n\nIf anyone wishes to talk more about this than add my ign and I can set up voice chat to convey my points better.","replies":[{"poster":"Froskurinn","date":"2016-04-05T04:50:46.171+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello! My name's Froskurinn and I currently work as an OPL and LPL shoutcaster for Riot Games.\n\nFirstly, I wanted to take a moment a thank you for your vested interest in the Oceanic Region at all levels as this is the first primary step in leveling up the region as a whole. You do bring a valid concern and goal: Leveling up the region's talent pool from the ground up to support a healthier and more competitive league.\n\nThere are a couple of issues however with your post, so I'm here to clarify things. **I'm speaking as someone with extensive work experience in the North American Challenger Series, the European Challenger Series, the League of Legends Pro League, the League of Legends Secondary Pro League, and the European League of Legends Championship Series.** I've worked as a coach, analyst, and caster in multiple regions - including the major regions (EU, NA, CN, KR)  and wildcard regions (Japan, Brazil, Turkey, and Oceania). \n\nYou bring up the LPL Format from 2015; which is similar to the EULCS format that will be adopted for 2016 Summer Split - it's a best of two. How it works is that 3 points are given to the winning team for a 2/0, one point is given to each team for a draw. Each team plays a round-robin twice. Most points wins. This structure of League is a balance between benefiting the broadcast and the teams.\n\nExample. Everyone should agree that a best of three or best of five format is theoretically the best practice for teams as most major tournaments utilize this format and it gives them the opportunity to practice adaptation between sets to establish \"mini-metas\" between teams stylistically. That said, from a broadcast point of view, this format is a nightmare - especially from a casting standpoint. The reason is that the game times vary, it's assumed about an hour per game, but the length of broadcasts can drastically change between a quick 2/0 or a 2/1. This is why there should never be a day of two best of fives.\n\n**Take LPL this split, which uses a best of three format:** LPL runs four days - Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Th/F are two best of twos and Sat/Sun are _three _ best of threes. A weekend broadcast can fluctuate between 6-11 hours depending on the results and pending technical difficulties. Thus, the best of two format is the perfect merge of broadcast friendly because you know exactly how many games you'll get in a session as well as offering the opportunity for the teams to experiment.\n\nThe best of two format rewards dominance by awarding 3 points to a 2/0 but doesn't punish experimentation by still rewarding points for a draw - be that roster rotation or a different composition entirely. Although, it should be weighted that learning happens _**off**_ the Rift, not on it.  \n\nNaturally, the OPL recognizes the positives for growth from best of three format and has implemented that format with best of five for the semi-finals and finals. This will give the teams a competitive edge when competing internationally. \n\nYou bring up this format for the OCS in the hopes that it will better benefit the players; which is correct. No one will argue that more time playing in a competitive environment should translate into growth; however, there are many more factors outside this including resources of the broadcasting team as well as _time resources from the players themselves. _\n\nIn the North American Challenger Scene there are quite a few third party tournaments outside the NACS. The most recent one I worked with was hosted by AlphaDraft which worked, as you implied above, on an invitation format to well-established or known Challenger Squads. The problem is that the Challenger scene is incredibly unstable - _everywhere_. \n\nChallenger players aren't getting the supplements professional players are earning. It's incredibly rare to have the advantage of NA where some Challenger teams throw around massive amounts of money. Majority are high ELO players strung together with bare-bones infrastructure. What ends up happening is that the tournament, which is fronted by a Sponsor (in this case, AlphaDraft - who is trying to put together an entertainment option to push their brand), will fumble the execution of the tournament because Challenger teams will constantly forfeit their matches. drop out of the tournament, or rotate countless subs between matches. \n\nNot because the Challenger players and teams want to cause strain on  the tournament or audience, but because they don't have the resources or structure to dedicate the amount of time needed for these events. Most are full-time students. \n\nAnd that's in North America. \n\nIn the Oceanic region we have **professional **players that have to balance work and school while playing at the highest level. The Dire Wolves have been publicly vocal about their top laner, Sharp, and his struggles to meet practice/scrim times with his team due to real-life responsibilities. \n\nSo, why doesn't Riot invest money into the Challenger scene by supplementing the teams in similar, but marginally smaller way, to the professional circuit? Inflation. In this [article ](http://www.goldper10.com/article/2846-thinkpiece-i-am-thankful-for-the-mediocre.html)(scroll down to \"The Cost of Inflation\"; although the entire article is very relevant to this conversation).\n\nIn short (but seriously, the article discusses this in-depth), the concern is that by inflating the performance of organizations that have no proven track-record of how to handle these resources leads to a lot of wasted money. We see this happening at the professional level - brand new organizations will buy Challenger teams going in the LCS, receive the supplements  from Riot, and misuse them, creating unstable structure - and again, wasting money that could be funneled into safer and more stable options for longevity for the Regions, Leagues, and Players.\n\nIt's always going to be balancing act of supporting the current eco-system of esports in League of Legends. Naturally, the wildcard regions have an uphill battle.\n\nBut Oceania even more. Consider the geographical limitations of the region compared to the other WildCard teams: Japan, Turkey, SouthEast Asia, and every other WildCard region _but_ Oceania has the ability to scrim or bootcamp major Regions. Turkey teams get to play on EUW and do scrim EUCS teams - occasionally the bottom EULCS teams. Brazil cannot play on NA from their location, but they do bootcamp to NA and scrim NACS teams and the occasional bottom NALCS team before major events. Japan plays on the KR and NA servers. \n\nOceania's primary problem is not an infrastructural one - although that can be leveled up - it's a geographic one. The cost associated with bootcamping one of these teams to power region is astronomically higher a toll than any other region- simply flying them off this continent. You pair that in tandem with the high cost of living near the central server (Sydney, one of the most expensive cities in the world) on top of the county's internet  infrastructure issues of simply connecting to the server stably - it's the perfect storm of obstacles that majority of other Regions don't face. And then, you place on top of it the finite resources that these teams on the professional level actually get.\n\nPro Gaming is not to the same evolution in Australia as it is in other countries. It's still very niche. \n\n**That said, the fact that Oceania has overcome these obstacles and continues to grow its esports scene at its current growth is fucking incredible. ** Nevermind the results that they've gotten internationally across multiple esport titles. No joke, not as someone who works in capacity with Riot - or just taking Riot into account - but OCE  now gets Australian based servers. That's a relatively new development - more and more game organizations and esports clubs are coming into the eco-system. This year, two professional teams got gaming-houses, that alone is a huge win and hopefully we'll continue to see those numbers go up. \n\nThe last point that I wanted to touch was the mandated scrim/practice  schedule with OCS teams from the Professional circuit. Frankly, that is team dependent and I don't foresee any governing body, Riot or otherwise, stepping into police that. Again, it's a resource  issue - but time based. Example: if the Dire Wolves have a limited scope of practice time between Sharp's full-time job, they're not going to want to invest that time into scrimming an OCS team, there is little value to them in preparation for their matches. Likewise, chances are, that OCS team will go through several iterations of its roster, scattering that experience gained due to instability of long-term contracts  to keep the investments to the teams.\n\nIn every region I've worked, only the bottom LCS  teams scrim the top CS teams - and barely. In fact, majority of the top teams will only scrim other top teams - not even balancing their scrim time evenly around their region. They're there to be the best, and it is not up to Riot to police how they achieve their success. \n\nI hope this clarified a lot of unspoken or other side of issues regarding building competitive integrity from the bottom up. Again, I very much agree with this ideology, but it's a very contrived issue with a lot of moving parts. I think the system in place can get better, but it's a balancing act to the health of all scenes involved.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolves","date":"2016-04-05T06:23:30.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly A massive thanks for taking the time to reply\nA few things I want to add that I didn't mention earlier. So like you said people are juggling, day to day living in oceanic region as well as their professional esport involvement. What I now realised I had in mind when I wrote the above opinions were that we would be investing into newer talent that were taking gap years, were not to invested into the work force so like partime or casual work, high school drop outs, or people who dnt necessarily have anything to do or havent thought what their next step in life is. ( I wana put people suffering from depression as well, but not gonna elaborate on it since its a very touchy topic) I know these groups of people dont sound like the elite catergory of players and I mean them no disrespect putting them in these classifications but my main thought process was that these people are the ones that have the amount of time to spare which is equivalent to those of the higher caliber regions. So now we end up with players that can dedicate their time and have no pressures from other responsibilities that they need to undergo and open up job from them in the professional scene. Now I am not saying we dismiss the top players that are juggling time and day to day lives the very best they can. I am just thinking about the long run benefits of the region. \n\nAlso I read the article on inflation. although it is true organisations that are new will sky rocket without actually putting much effort into earning the status I believe with what I said just before and the implementation of another rule which is closing the transfer season or window till the end of splits (would also mean that the number of subs a team is allowed to have will increase), This is another way it will guarantee the stability of these tournaments. Plus having contracts (legally binding of course) that would require teams to follow through to the end of the competition. Drop out on players and organisations would face Riots ruling on banned from competitive play for certain time frames. Meaning riots policing and solid rules and regulations will make sure the tournaments are stable and that any funding or compensation of resources done by riot does not go to waste.\n\nWith the viewership and the format idea, I was mainly thinking along the lines of if as a region we run our events in a professional and appealing manner with the increased time on air. With hosting from our OPL . OCS and Other Invitational Tournaments in off season. Due to the outlook of the region and the manner we perform or host these events and with our strict rules and regulations and guidelines we will come across as legitimate sources and represent our region in the best way possible. This in turn will increase the viewer count because alot of people tune in due to regularity , convenience as well as presentation. With that our number will sky rocket. That is also why I wanted a format that hosted more games but not to the point where it is intensive for caster and show runners. So only two game format similar to LPL style with no third game tie breaker until semifinals and finals ( that can go up to best of 5) \n\nBecause of the scale of things it opens of more job opportunities, I am not saying for riot to pay from their pockets. Alot of the newer people in different jobs are looking for work experience and alot of them do not mind doing internship work without pay as long as they get credentials saying that they worked with organisations and groups with a work load of a massive scale. The pay is obviously a bonus that they will be able to facilitate once things kick off. I know things do not happen over night but I believe you have to start somewhere and this is where I believe we need to start.\n\nAlso I do acknowledge that it may be very long hours of work due to the uncontrollable lengthy games against equal level opponents or disconnections that  drag on. However I can say it will be the same for all the workers but it means we get more time publicizing our region. \n\nAlso I am very happy that the region has made it this far and I think we these changes we can go even further in a shorter  period of time.\n\nAlso thank you so much for the reply it was a nice read and helped me understand a couple of things that i didnt know.","replies":[{"poster":"Froskurinn","date":"2016-04-05T07:15:53.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's no problem at all. I really enjoy these conversations and think they are incredibly important to the region's health. Again, we need more people like you questioning the status quo and continuing the improvement of our leagues. \n\nThere simply seems to be a misalignment between us on how and what to invest in the region for productive growth. With the University Clubs rolling out and Riot investing guides and training to these clubs on the Uni and Highschool level it's effectively trying to grow talent from the ground up - like your ideology - but its encompassing a much larger player base than just the competitive aspect and not just with dollar supplements.\n\nExample, the professional level of play is obviously the smallest pool of players in League of Legends. A significant amount of people actually just want to play League of Legends as a bonding tool with their friends. These Clubs at the Highschool and Uni level are designed as a gate for that population of player, as well as offering the ability to register in a Competitive League to foster growth. \n\nLast year I got to cast the Finals between the University of NSW and Auckland University, was a blast. \n\nBut that's Riot not investing hard and fast rules of: \"you must scrim these teams  or we'll pay you this much or contracts must look like this\" - it's Riot trying to empower the community with tools to grow their talent. It's a finite number of resources issue, and it makes more sense from an ecosystem standpoint to invest most in the League that Riot has the most  control in: OPL.\n\nBut by empowering those Organizations and Clubs, hopefully it trickles down to the playerbase in developing talent for the next generation.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolves","date":"2016-04-05T08:49:31.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I sorta do actually get the ideal behind the clubs and stuff. Because if I remember back to season one or two there was like massive amounts of like regional tournaments in NA that people could go to and for a time period I believe having more tournament and having more community based groups that allow some form of competitive field to make them feel involved. \n\nI guess in my opinion I am looking to make the end goal seem more appealing to new comers and newer talent, so they have this desire to rise to the competitive scene. Where as riots current approach in a way  is like facilitating that journey into a smoother transition. As more tournaments mean more exposure meaning you get noticed via scouts. Compared to the old way via recommendations off solo queue games via scouts which also took into account the players position on the challenger ladder. \n\nThe reason I think I moved away from that regional tournament type of thought was because the region as a whole is still not recognized as a talent pool to other regions and just because of that we are some what of a laughing stalk as I believe only two players every had over seas offers. ( Keane and Shernfire?) So like the highest point a player up and coming could ever achieve would only be the top team in OPL  and having a spot for wildcard. \n\nGood thought process riot but I think they need to catch with the bigger picture, I think both of the plans need to take effect.\n\nThat is probably the reason why I sorta took on the idea of increasing the end goal to look more appealing, A better spot light position I should say. A potentially for a career in another region for some of these players. And the chance to play against one of the best really.\n\nSorry I had to google your ign to figure out who you were lol.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"OCE Yisus","date":"2016-04-04T22:48:28.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly\n\nThe results have been rather the same in the recent wild cards - second place and don't go worlds, but even if we did we would be instantly demolished\n\nWhat we need is to not have the same damn team playing it all the time, we need new talent and new players with diverse tactics, play styles and different champion mains so that turkey and Russia stop banning all champions they know we can use because they know EXACTLY what our top team will use.\n\nWe need an underdog to go in","replies":[{"poster":"Wolves","date":"2016-04-05T02:06:29.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If we make it to worlds, get instantly put above other regions, we get potential investers, Also riot will have to increase prize pool to fund a region making it to compete at worlds.
