This is why you won't see dominion and especially not ranked 3's as it will draw attention AWAY from the already struggling oce scene. (im not going to call it a 'pro' scene lol.)\n\nbtw, oce will never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever be able to compete on a  competitive level internationally. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Conre","date":"2015-06-11T04:14:01.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah and i thank riot for what they are doing, i would like the infrastructure of OCE Esports to be a real thing, sure they may never compete to that level but in time they can honestly catch up, as for your dominion over 3's thing i think that's more your personal opinion, honestly you're one of the first person i have ever met that would like a dominion queue in OCE but honestly why cant we have what all the other servers have anyways.\n\nAlso there is no harm in trying to at least get Riots attention that people may actually want Ranked 3's. i at the most am just hoping they bring it to the schedule of when regular 3's is up.","replies":[{"poster":"Focus On End","date":"2015-06-11T07:03:04.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You realise the only reason they try to develop esports is because it's the most profitable avenue for them, you realise this yes?","replies":[{"poster":"Conre","date":"2015-06-11T10:47:08.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course, everyone loves money but you make it sound like riot are bad people for focusing on making some players in OCE possibly have their dream job.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Conre","date":"2015-06-11T04:28:03.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly though this post would get a lot more love then it did hate, Obviously a lot of the OCE community is full of newer players that never experienced playing ranked 3's back on NA Both the old and new 3's.\n\nEven if people didn't experience or maybe even enjoy Ranked 3's i would have thought it may have sparked something for those people that dislike the fact that they are missing out on end of season icons because they couldn't participate in ranked 3's unlike other servers.","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-06-11T08:10:21.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Conre,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=1NKMtLWt,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-06-11T04:28:03.025+0000)\n>\n> I honestly though this post would get a lot more love then it did hate, Obviously a lot of the OCE community is full of newer players that never experienced playing ranked 3's back on NA Both the old and new 3's.\n> \n> Even if people didn't experience or maybe even enjoy Ranked 3's i would have thought it may have sparked something for those people that dislike the fact that they are missing out on end of season icons because they couldn't participate in ranked 3's unlike other servers.\n\nYou can only use 1 icon at the time, and most of the end of season icons are trash. there's no reason to use them over just about any other icon. also 3's is the worst game mode, you pick someone with resets or a bruiser and you stomp everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"Conre","date":"2015-06-11T10:44:59.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well there is alot of people that like to collect things like that, i personally would like to have a diamond ranked 3's ranked 5's and SoloQ Icon because it makes me feel like i have achieved something.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-06-11T04:23:18.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not worth posting on leddit for.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-06-11T04:07:07.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The new TT is garbage, RIP old TT.","replies":[{"poster":"Conre","date":"2015-06-11T04:14:17.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, but with 2 other friends it can still be a good time, And the fact that there are end of Season Icons that the whole of OCE is missing out on is pretty unfair in my honest opinion, i do enjoy collecting icons myself.","replies":[]}]}]}
