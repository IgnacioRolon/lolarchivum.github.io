The endless hours of fun, laughs, the way it satisfies my competitive nature, the beautiful skins and amazing reworks; these are some of the many reasons I think this is one of the best games in the world.\r\n\r\nI started playing in April of season 5, when I was introduced by my housemate. Almost immediately, a spark was ignited within me. I am sure most of us experienced this. I am talking about the moment when it clicked that this game was amazing and you set off on your adventure to learn everything you could about it. Like realising that bork was probably not a very efficient item on Annie. My housemate was a support main, so he taught me the basics of how to play the role. Around this point I started investing a lot of time into the game, I was pretty addicted. Working nights, I put in a lot of time and ended up Silver 4 the end of season 5. Season 6, I put in more effort again and hit gold. I remember being so frustrated I couldn't get past my gold 1 promos. I let tilt take over and I ended the season Gold 2. Season 7, is where I really focused. I mean it when I say, I no-lifed League last year. I'm talking 8 hours a day. The time and effort paid off, I hit my goal of Diamond and I was over the moon when I got there. \r\n\r\nSo now in season 8, I have this shiny Diamond border that I always wanted. Well, I thought I always wanted. If I knew what was to come with it, I would never have put so much effort into getting it.  At the end of the year, I took a break from League and moved across the country. After this break, I came back and decided, I didn't want to play the game so competitively anymore, well at least for the majority of the season, so I started playing a lot of normal games and the occasional ranked game on a smurf. I also switched roles to AD and Top, with the occasional support game, just to change things up a bit. I just wanted to chill and have more fun with the game, instead of playing meta and tryharding to win. This is when I realised my border, which is supposed to be a mark of my achievement, was actually no more than a target on my head. Its become evidently clear that the majority of players in my games think that because I have a diamond border, I must be Diamond level at all 5 roles and all 141 champions in the game. That's what a diamond border means, right? Since when did Normal games become so serious? Most of the players I meet, you would think they were actually gaining or losing LP. \r\n\r\nAnother thing that I have had to deal with, is the attitude that because I was a support main, I am automatically a 'Boosted E-girl'. If someone could genuinely explain to me how it is relevant whether a player is male or female in league of legends, I would like to hear it. I do not understand this at all. In my opinion, discrimination based on a person's ASSUMED gender, is just as bad as discriminating someone based on assumed race. Honestly the things I have been told in regards to this are absolutely disgusting. I put in HOURS of time and commitment to learn the role and play all the support champions. I did this over SEASONS to get to where I finished last year. But all of that goes out of the window because it is the support role. Any other role, there would be no mention of the word boosted. \r\n\r\nI know there will be people who read this that think, why are you taking this to heart? After playing this game for a considerable amount of time, I honestly have developed a thick skin. But I am not talking about coming across someone who has had a bad day or something and is in a crap mood, I am talking about people actually bullying on a semi-regular basis. I would say that every second game there has been someone treating another player in a reportable manner. If you consider how many games are played on any given day on this server, there is a substantial amount of this happening. I am not an angel, by any means. I have said things out of frustration or through having a bad day. League is a competitive game, its only natural to get worked up about it. However, there is a point where it crosses the line and becomes completely inappropriate. \r\n\r\nAs a side note, YES I am aware there is a mute button and a report button. The mute button, I feel I use considerably more than I should have to. The report button, feels as if its one of those links on a website that leads to an: Error - page not found. Completely and utterly useless. The real question here is why do members of the community think its okay to treat other players this way? In a way that I guarantee would embarrass them if the people in their physical world knew about it. The most important question of all is: Why is there little to no punishment?\r\n\r\nOver the past few months, my spirit has been broken down and my confidence ruined. From being told I have mental or physical disabilities, being asked where I bought my account, death threats, hacking threats, being told to commit suicide or engage in explicit acts with members of my family, being added by these players to be abused more, the list goes on and on. The fire I once had for this game, has been extinguished by the near constant amount of general negativity these players cause. And what does riot do? \r\n\r\nI tried to post a ticket on the riot support website and I get a Capture error. I google this and there has been people complaining about it since May, it is still not fixed. You literally cant post a ticket, even in the other categories on the Riot support website. Its very clear that this company is more focused towards making skins, than fixing the toxicity or even it's own support website. But which one brings in the most money?\r\n\r\nAfter 3 years and over 3 grand spent on this game, I have officially uninstalled it. I refuse to be the target of someone's spiteful entertainment any longer, while Riot rolls around in their millions of dollars, refusing to acknowledge their actual player base. But hey that new Darius skin is cool hey?\r\n\r\nSincere thanks to those who have contributed to making this game extremely fun to play (!)\r\nTo those people who ACTUALLY were awesome, ggwp&lt;3 \r\n\r\nadi√≥s para siempre","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-06-29T08:12:07.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good post. NEACE said it well on a recent Fortnite stream of his: \"If self-entitled brats play badly in game, they then turn into bullies and trolls\". Pretty simple summary of the community really. Riot with all of their silly constant changing of the game since season 5, have failed to grasp the future effect of these changes. Players that became attached to champions that have since been reworked have been marginalised. Skill level in the game is at an all time low, because the game is not only complicated in one aspect (constant changing of the meta) but dumbed down in another aspect (basic gameplay adjustments). Patch 8.13 is another stupid patch that ruins skill level in the game.\n\nSeriously Riot, a small investment into a proper working support team (for in-game indiscretions) and an examination of the changes since the end of season 4 by hiring a serious analyst like LastShadow could avoid these sorts of issues. They are just unwilling to change, and are in it for the short term gains until the game dies, like Runescape did. The line \"but we want to keep the game fresh\" is an abomination. The game should be kept in a similar state for a while, not changing the meta every 4 patches. People would then have a chance to enjoy and practice a playstyle, champions, and actually understand how the game works. Perhaps you might see less uptight players in-game purely from doing this.\n\nSad to see another passionate good player leave.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gangaa","date":"2018-06-29T07:18:38.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mute all at the begging of every match if you are having so much issues with trolls.\nand play the game how you want to nobody can stop you from having fun but yourself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gryffindor","date":"2018-06-29T07:10:29.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats why i never play a league game unless i have at least 2 others in my party, that way i never have to deal with people flaming or if we do get flamed we outnumber them so it just becomes a joke we all go along with.
