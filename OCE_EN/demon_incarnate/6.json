I'm first pick, I pick Garren.... I select \"Top\" & \"Fighter\" as my role.\nThat way i'm locked into a Ranking System but even better!!!... My team now KNOW.\nThat i plan to go Top and that my play STYLE is \"Off Tank Damage\" not just \"Straight Tank\"\nor I Pick Leona, Select \"Bottom\" And \"Support Tank\"\nor I pick Ash, Select \"Bottom\" and \"ADC\"\n\nAs far as i know there are only so many roles you can play. They are\n\nADC\nSupport Tank\nSupport Mage\nSupport Fighter\nMid AP\nMid AD\nMid Tank\nMid Fighter\nJungle Ap\nJungle Ad\nJungle Tank\nJungle Fighter\nTop Ap\nTop Ad\nTop Fighter\nTop Tank\n\n( this might also include a Assassin class for each role (except support lol) )\n\nAnd they could all fall UNDER a 5 column rank system\nMid\nSupport\nAdc\nJungle\nTop\n\nThis would allow for so much more out of LoL\nfor example....\n\nNew game, Champion SELECTION... Some one says \"Ranked 4th ADC\" ... You check.... They are.... \"Let \"######\" adc i just checked hes good\"... People let him adc, and NOWyou have a strong adc.\n\nAlso would it be so hard for match making to \"try\" select .. this persons best role is adc, this persons best role is Tank top, this person best role is jungle etc etc etc and then put them together? I mean of course champ selection rule would still be in effect and you might not always want to jungle but at least this way you have a fighting CHANCE at a team with strengths? instead of an entire team that wants to ADC or MID?\n\nMaybe even when you pick a champion in character selection a small Rank Stat could appear as well, for example\nSome one picks\nEve ... a little window beside her pick or summoner NAME could display\nGames PLAYED as Eve\nRank as Jungle or Mid Depending on where she selects\n\nIs says GAMES Played 0 <- includes normal games\nRank 600,0000th\n\nAnd before the game starts you already know.... this bitch is a Noob jungle ,needs to babysit\nIt also might give you a chance to be like \"dude, please don't play first time eve in ranked, we want to WIN. can you please pick a champ your stronger with\" He swaps to Rammus jungle 1500 games played ranked 1st on Oce.
