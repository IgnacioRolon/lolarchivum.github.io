As such different levels of these factors can and do occur. \nSome people will get more leavers in their games, some less. If the prior is possible it must also be possible that it could get so bad that it gets to the stage your lumped with the people that cause the problem due to a win loss ranking system. Even though you yourself are not a leaver or troll and have \"average\" skill which should at least land you a place in silver or gold. Been lumped with the people that are leavers and afk's will result in a never ending cycle of games with leavers and trolls. Resulting in a \"ELO HELL\"  **_\n\nIf you repute this in my opinion your not only arrogant but have no grasp of reality also making you mentally deranged","replies":[]},{"poster":"Demon Incarnate","date":"2015-11-09T21:54:25.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/111097072/200191669/eog","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2015-11-08T21:58:13.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is brilliant!","replies":[]}]}
