Is it not possible to collect these stat's and group people accordingly?\n\nThis would mean that feeders and unskilled players are separated from the the more skilled\n\n***3) R18 / 12ies***\nAlthough I don't know how you would police this or enforce it. Maybe some sort of incentive to be honest, or maybe even ID requirement for R18. But separating the Old from the young i think would have a MASSIVE positive effect\n\nThis would mean the 12ies are not exposed to bad language, and us old ####'s wont get banned for using language we find expectable. Also i truly that older players are far better than younger players. We take the game more seriously, and are less likely to troll, intentionally feed or afk. Due to been more mature (in the most part) and our Mums not telling us to get off and go to bed mid game.\n\n**4) MVP's**\nI'm far from a genus but I'm sure someone out there is, MVP?\nIn game votes for MVP and MNP not including Duos or Pre-made Team votes. \nMost damage to Champs?\nLeast Deaths?\nMost Wards Detecting Players/Placed?\nMost Damage to Towers?\nMost Gold?Most Assists?\nMost damage to/securing Objectives\nAnd my fav if you could do this Most Initiates leading to team fight wins.\nWhy cant stat's and stat's like these all be figured out by some little maths formula to create MVP's\nAnd.... if you can do this, why not have a MNP Most noob player\n\n**5) You actually do something about our reports**. \nHell if you paid me a wage I would sit here full time and read and evaluate them myself. No one is more sick of these afk, int feeders, trolls slipping through the crack and ruining peoples games than me. I don't ban for abuse unless it involves Family, Death threats, Suicidal undertones or wishing illness on people. Been told Someone F##king Sucks, and there Noob as f##K does cont as abuse, **you can mute people at any-time** and it would take a serious case form me to think that someone should be banned for abuse.\n\n**6) Even tighter and stricter rules about AFK and Leavers in ranked.**\nI know leaver buster is there... But people still don't give a shit. I am getting just as much leavers if not more than when we didn't have \"leaver buster\" No this only applies to ranked, yes still have leaver buster in normals. \nBut in Ranked leaving or been reported as AFK must be summoners biggest fear. I don't know how many times I've had gamer with people just sitting at the summoner platform moving there character every now and again to avoid leaver buster. \nI mean it cant be hard to tell when a summoner has Not done any damage for a certain amount of time, Has not left the base/summoners platform for a certain amount of time. Maybe if these two things happen you could give summoners a \"GET BACK IN THE FIGHT\" warning. similar to the one you give afks.\n\nNow these are just ideas to try make a better match making system. \nLet me know what you think or if you have any other idea's\n\n**P.s if you just going to come on here just to put negative comments with no real feed back or suggestion ull get a \"Thanks for the Bump\" reply**","replies":[{"poster":"Demon Incarnate","date":"2015-02-06T11:53:52.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bronze should be matched with Bronze\nSilver with Silver\n\nI'm finding it SO hard to get out of S5, due to always having Bronzies in my team.\nI've done my time in bronze, why should i be placed with them?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Demon Incarnate","date":"2015-02-06T09:16:20.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for you comments, All i know is Match making is horrid atm and something needs to be done.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-02-06T07:46:42.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Number of normals played\n\nYes because anyone who has played more than 1000 normal games will automatically, and without effort, gain skill. Or is it wrong to assume that people with higher amounts of normal games played are always better?\n\n> KDR / Assist Ratio\n\nThere is no way to implement this without completely screwing people over. Either it's going to be different for each position, without a system to know what position someone is playing, or it's going to be standard regardless of position, which you've already covered with your statements. Fact is K/D/A is **not** the only factor of games, nor is it the most important.\n\n> R18 / 12ies\n\nThis has been tossed around a bit on the forums/boards and frankly it's far from a good idea. You're basically enforcing the stereotype that age is the determining factor of toxicity. Not to mention there is no way Riot can enforce the age requirements without breaking their privacy policy, which is there to protect the privacy of players.\n\n> MVP's\n\nI can see some potential with this though one could argue that the honour system is already something that does this. I feel though that an automated system would not be appropriate for two reasons. 1, Stats aren't always an accurate reflection of how well someone played in a particular game and there is no way to do this effectively, as an automated system, without having some way to determine what position someone was playing, which is actually impossible for an automated system. 2, This is a team game and the way people interact with each other is important. While having it set as a manual vote could be abuse-able a solution could be that people who have been consistently reported/punished are unable to vote.\n\n> You actually do something about our reports.\n\nI actually find it a little funny how ignorant you are in regards to this.\n\n> Even tighter and stricter rules about AFK and Leavers in ranked.\n\nI do kind of agree with this. I would agree that there are more AFKs and leavers in ranked, simply because that's where 'trolls' get the most attention, and would agree to stricter rules/punishments to those who break the rules in ranked. It is a more competitive environment than any other queues, why not treat it as such?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-06T07:23:18.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree with you on a few points, and on some points partially agree with you. \nFirstly... number of normals won? Nope, let's not go with that, but use our normals MMR to determine this, because of smurfs and because of players who are just plain better (like, I have seen people with 600 wins that I would call worse than me). Still, I agree and say that normals should be something of a determinant. Meanwhile, ranked MMR should influence normal MMR because some people play mostly ranked, improve a lot, and go into normals against people of their old skill level.\nKDA... should be taken into account to some extent, if we can get a working system for it. It should be a kills + assists to death ratio however. Think of the games where supports secure kills the ADC cannot/quite possibly cannot get. Also, think of junglers donating kills and tanky toplaners not outdamaging the assassins and ADCs. If it is based on kills and not kills + assists, I think there could be toxicity with people competing for kills in order to get MMR, and junglers would not donate kills to laners.\nThe MVPs thing? Not sure about that, because I'm not too sure about the practicality of trying to apply it, but I'm not ruling it out.\nAlso, reports and punishments. Yes, they really need to be dealt with. I think that the punishments for AFKs and Leavers in ranked need to be more serious. Not only would it stop trolls from going in, I think it could encourage players who are having a bad day to not just give up, even though the motivation is fear of punishment.","replies":[]}]}
