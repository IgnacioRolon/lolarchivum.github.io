The Flaming trolls are numerous \nI know you all feels me when I say this. I win almost all my games, till I get to promos. Then I get the afk,leaver,dc / Intentional feeder.\nIts really starting to bug me, I must have played promos like 4-5 times already and no joke, every time I've gotten afks in at least 2 of my games. \n\nSo I'm here looking for a good DUO partner\nI live in NZ and am on most days\nI would like to see a fair amount of normals played on ur account, maybe a couple seasons worth.\nAlso please have runes for most if not all roles. \nIf you are \"anything but support\" \"trash jungle\" \"mid or afk\" \"top or feed\" \"only adc\" then don't bother\nI main jungle {{champion:9}} {{champion:35}} but am effective in all roles and I expect my duo to be also. remembering that we have to make up for out \"teams\" short comings. \nI ask that you are **mature minded**. I don't mind rage much, but afks and intentional feeding is a big no no.\nI don't really use a mic, and don't really want to. I don't feel you need to with the new ping system.\n\n**At the end of the day, what im after is a summoner that can hold their own. That rarely loses their lane. Someone that when we have team fights. They dont run off and farm wraiths and realises that dragon fights/secures can win or lose a game. Oh and of course.... does not focus the bloody tanks.**\n\nDont bother msg me on here. Just add me \"Demon Incarnate\" ill look at ur runes, ill look at the # of normals played. And if i like what i see we will dive straight into it. or have a normal just to test the waters. \n\nHope to hear from you soon","replies":[{"poster":"Demon Incarnate","date":"2015-02-06T14:13:45.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks to those people that have read and added me.","replies":[]}]}
