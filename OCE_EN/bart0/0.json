That wall right there at that spot is the thinnest wall in the game, so many displacement abilities that would normally be unable to go through walls since they don't generate enough distance can go through that one. Any displacement ability can take you over a wall if it's small enough (unless otherwise specified).\n\nIt's essentially the difference between getting your cursor all the way over the wall and flashing it successfully, or not moving your cursor far enough and smacking face first into the wall instead. Flash can take you over walls alright, but if you don't make it long enough it's not going to.\n\nYou wouldn't practically use Sion's ult to get over a wall with that last little dash but, that doesn't mean it's impossible/unintended.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-02-09T07:01:43.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its like hecarim using his e to get over walls, he is not supposed to and it hard to, but it is a valid mechanic.\n\nThis thresh pull also doesn't have to do with just that wall bing super thin, it also works on wolves wall, the other river wall, the gates and drag wall.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-02-09T08:32:43.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't aware the thresh one was long enough to go through other walls, though it is fair long the more I think about it :P Can't say I've ever tried but it would be an interesting thing.
