This means that if we want to buy an Epic skin worth 1350 RP, US pays $10 while we have to pay $25. Or in the case of buying an Ultimate skin, US pays $25 and we pay $35.\r\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}} \r\nI ask one of two things. Either lower the price of everything in the OCE store to come in line with the fact that we just get less Riot Points or make the Riot Points we get the normal US amount. \r\n\r\nIf this is to be a problem where you&#039;re worried OCE players on the NA server will use game cards bought in store to get more RP for cheaper. \r\nWell, I have two ideas. \r\nEither make the cards region specific so that when someone buys an OCE card they get less RP if they redeem it on the NA server or make it nonredeemable on the NA client if it is bought in OCE and vice versa.\r\n\r\nThe third and final idea I have is making the price be in line with the equivalent USD. So the $10 RP would actually be $12.85 AUD etc. This way you could not lose any money and we would not have to spend twice the amount of money just to get the same skin.\r\n\r\nHonestly I don&#039;t even know if anyone else sees it as a problem. Either way I thought I&#039;d voice this. \r\nThanks for reading and bye!","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-10-23T08:29:57.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Base regional costs for Riot Points, as mentioned in the original post:\n\nAU                  NZ (OCE)\n$10\t1,100\t1,100\n$25\t2,830\t2,830\n\nUS (NA)\n$10 US\t1,380\n$25 US\t3,500\n\n[In the current market, 1 USD exchanges for 1.28 AUD](http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=1&From=USD&To=AUD). If we convert the NA pricing from USD to AUD, we'd get the conversions:\n\nAU (NA)\n$12.80 AU\t1,380 -> 107.8 Riot Points/AUD\n$32 AU\t3,500 -> 109.4 Riot Points/AUD\n\nNow we can compare with the base regional costs for AU and NZ:\n\nAU (OCE, Base)\n$10\t1,100 -> 110.0 Riot Points/AUD\n$25\t2,830 ->\t113.2 Riot Points/AUD\n\nBased on this analysis, Australians actually get a better deal (**albeit marginally**) for Riot Points than our American counter parts. Hopefully that alleviates any of the concerns that you have regarding inter-regional RP pricing.","replies":[]}]}
