Coz she isnt compared to before lol.\n\nOkay. Before 6.9.. Just as 6.8 landed..\n\nQuoted from http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Illaoi?cb=6767\n\nFACT: Overlapping tentacles deal 50% reduced damage. Affects active placed tentacles by her passive and Q as well.\n\nFor example, a tentacle deals 500 damage to a unit. Two tentacles damaging the same unit would then deal 750 and three tentacles would then deal 875 damage to that same unit. Either this is a bug that Riot has overlooked for some time or a tooltip that needs to be stated somewhere in her kit preferrably in her passive. Hoping that Riot does something about this.\n\nThen you got the \" VESSEL DEBUFF DURATION 60 seconds â‡’ 12 seconds \" Why couldnt it be 30 seconds....\nFINE.. Take your no more FoW vision.. I can deal with that.\n\nBut the fact that if my tentacle over lap.. If I cannot get them again in 12 seconds to keep that debuff on them over and over.. COME ON..\nAnyone can see she is broken. You say \" She isnt broken. \" Well if I said to you. Any champion you play. Will do 50% or less on each spell damage you do.\nYou would be saying that 6.9 BROKE YOUR CHAMPION TO THE POINT IT IS USELESS.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Sxcrage,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=ikJN83k7,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2016-05-05T10:41:28.055+0000)\n>\n> Now stop complaining when you dont even have a reason coz you lost 1 game.
