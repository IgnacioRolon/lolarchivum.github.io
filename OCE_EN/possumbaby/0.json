Then PvP came along and started killing my soul.\r\nWhy do grown men feel that it is ok to act like this is their personal venting ground for all their butt hurts? Fair play and giggles to you if you&#039;re clever about it but trolling to get your rocks off with little intelligence and bad cliches - what&#039;s the point? How is this gratifying? \r\n\r\nAnd yes I can mute all but I don&#039;t want to. Part of the fun is trading words. But &quot;Wtf (insert name here)?!?&quot; &quot;lol rekt scrub&quot; or &quot;stop ks noob&quot;, there is nothing more boring and just alerts people that you&#039;re actually really shit and are dumb enough to think that by typing that shit it&#039;ll place the blame elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI could go on and on and on but you&#039;ve heard it before or you think I&#039;m a loser for (insert low intelligence reason here).\r\n\r\nI was fine to report the really toxic ones quietly and cross my fingers the system works but today someone went too far. This person was on my friend list. I told him right before a game that I was really sick of people trolling. If I wanted to hear what idiots who just hit puberty had to say, I&#039;d shoot myself in the head first.\r\n\r\nHe proceeded to troll and feed the whole game like a douche canoe. I was all like &quot;wtf dude? stop&quot;, he didn&#039;t so I said publicly that I would defriend him.\r\nHe then went on to tell the whole instance that apparently I sent him boobs and then got mad that he had a girlfriend. And that I was fat of course.\r\n\r\nHe knew I was female and chose to use basic /b/ level shit to get his &quot;revenge&quot; I guess? And the other apparent prepubescents ate it up.\r\n\r\nWhy am I posting this? Guess I want to vent too. In what I consider a more civilized way.\r\n\r\nAny insecure little boys who want to troll me go ahead, leave a comment and go jerk it in the dark.\r\n\r\nOr you could grow up and still have your fun but be clever about it. I can respect that.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s it.

Because of this, we have a really broad player base with people of all ages on the Rift.\n\n+ What happened to you with that feeder is not excusable under any grounds and he will be dealt with accordingly through our [current report system](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/reports-how-do-they-work).\n\n However some of the previous cases you outlined such as just as, _\"venting\"_ and _\"bad cliches\"_, might just be the product of some players who are too young or ignorant to understand that League in-game chat is not the place to post everything.\n\nOften the best way to change this behavior is to ignore it. It wont take long for most new players to realize that no one is interested in their 2009 un-dank memes.\n\nI'm not here to say anything you did was wrong, we're glad you're highlighting this here, but I'd just like for you to understand the whole picture :)","replies":[{"poster":"PossumBaby","date":"2016-05-05T11:15:29.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, thanks for replying, really appreciate it.\n\nI do understand that some of these people are actually 13, and factor for that accordingly. I actually stop my friends raging at players who are obviously kids.  Rule #1 - Don't feed the trolls.\n\nThe people I'm referring to are those who I either know or suspect to be legally adults. You may doubt in how or if I'm able to identify this and that is your prerogative and totally understandable. And I'm not giving away my trade secrets here :p My professional life involves having to make similar determinations.\n\nI think my dream here is that someone who is old enough to know better might reevaluate the way they are behaving or at least smarten up their game. Miracles can happen, right? :p Mainly it's a way to vent as I said in my original post, so I don't rage quit or decide that if they're doing it maybe I should just exceed their level (I'm being brutally honest). \n\nI am a realist and know that human nature is not a force you can control and there is no magical solution. I will continue to report where someone steps over that line from being just a dick to possibly needing a bit of therapy.\n\nIn regard to the specific incident I referred to, I have been informed (by someone who knows him) that the guy has already been perma-banned \n3 times and is apparently just a horrible sociopath. Hopefully he'll just get tired of having to create new accounts and doesn't escalate to killing kittens and necrophilia.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DravensNation","date":"2016-05-05T09:08:19.895+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The new player grind, I feel ya man... although i'm one of the extreamly toxic members of the community, I have had so many accounts banned that I just ask people to mute me at the start of the game.. fml","replies":[{"poster":"PossumBaby","date":"2016-05-05T10:37:22.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can I ask why you do it?
