For how long are you going to sit there and do nothing? I have reported at least 60 players in this new season  and blocked them and I still get trolls in my team again and again, as it seems no matter how many times I report and block and everything you still will match me up with trolls. In one case you matched me up with the same abusive flaming trolls 4 times in a row, why I have to go through this abuse, through this loss of time (because losing is one thing but losing because you have trolls feeding the enemy team is a different) through this punishment?? AND no I do not have friends that play LoL so I am a soloquer. THIS IS RIDICULOUS, I win I get promoted and 4 times now after my promotion I have 3 and 4 games in a row with trolls, resulting my demotion and there we go again. SO I assume I have to become a troll too, since you do not care at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-02-05T03:05:05.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Few things we should understand here.\n\n+ The report system isn't instant. It can take a up to few hours to review and judge each individual case. This means that if you report someone and then play again, it's likely you'll get matched up with the same person. If they get in-game before the report has processed, the system will wait until they finish before punishing them.\n\n+ Another thing people don't understand, when you get into a bad attitude due to a troll or feeder, _**take a break**_. Play some ARAM or find a different way to relax.\n\n When you play with a tilted mind set, you'll encourage others to tilt as well. You'll be quicker to blame a team-mate and flame at something small. You might not notice this but it happens. \n\n If you let a bad experience influence you, you'll go into the next game and create a bad experience for someone else, who will in turn create a bad experience for someone else... etc. \n\n This is something called **_Diffusion Analysis_**. You can learn more about how it effects League [here](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022160/More-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player).\n\n+ Lastly, you need to dodge games. If you see a troll on your team dodge the game. \n\n This will take a while to explain but dodging ranked games is actually good for climbing. Check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1Ji2SjgVSA) video for a more in-depth explanation.\n\nI hope this helps. Remember to keep a calm head in-game and in life.","replies":[{"poster":"Tr3lohim","date":"2016-02-05T11:09:50.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all thanks but..............\n No offense to 10 years old player, I am not one of them. I know that the report system is not instant but still I do not get why you cannot cross check players and the matches and reports they made or had before you end up matching them again and again together, we live in 2015 and setting something will greatly improve this game and our experiences.\n\nEven after games with trolls, I do not flame or abuse anyone or feed in my next game, I will just mute if needed. Therefore, I am not the one needing a break, I do not even flame trolls that are abusive to the team. So, I am having games I have a positive impact for my team but still I get matched ups with troll.\n\nDodging when I am just promoted, therefore I have 0 points in not an option, especially since in my last 4 promotions (and I am speaking for this new season) from B3 to B2 I get 3 to 4 games in a row with trolls that feed, therefore I get promoted 4 times in a row (only with 3 to 4 games and wins) and then thanks to these match ups I get demoted straight away, no matter what I do.\n\nAnd the reason I wrote this, is that I just had enough, I have reported numerous trolls/flamers/feeders and I have got only one response that \"thanks to my report a player was punished etc etc.\" only one out of 50 (in the new season) and another 200 from before reports. I am not a pro but I am good, but getting over 50-60% match ups with trolls that feed, in more than one cases I had up to 6 games with trolls, takes away any satisfaction.\n\nSorry but that's the truth at least for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-02-05T20:44:25.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll try to clear this up again;\n\n>  I do not get why you cannot cross check players and the matches and reports they made or had before you end up matching them again and again together, we live in 2015 and setting something will greatly improve this game and our experiences.\n\n+ This system cannot be implemented because it's too easy to abuse. \n_What stops me from reporting all the mechanically bad players? _\n_What stops me from reporting all the Teemo mains so they have ridiculous queue times?_\n\n If this was ever implimented, the way to climb elo would be to report everyone who doesn't win lane. Ranked would be a reporting frenzy and 40% of the population would have massive queue times.\n\nThe truth is, you know this is not the current system we have. Therefore you cannot blame Riot when you spam games, knowing there is a troll at your MMR. I find it hard to believe how this happened 4 times before you realised and stopped.\n\n> I am not the one needing a break, I do not even flame trolls that are abusive to the team. So, I am having games I have a positive impact for my team but still I get matched ups with troll.\n\n+ Even though Riot's research suggests the contrary, I'll take your word on this. \n\n Keep in mind a positive impact is not a neutral one. Be sure to congratulate your team on good plays and decisions. _\"GJ\"_ and _\"nice\"_ can make a world of difference sometimes.\n\n> Dodging when I am just promoted, therefore I have 0 points in not an option.\n\n+ Actually it is the best option. Remember dodging doesn't effect MMR only LP. You can only be demoted if your _**MMR is too low, not LP.**_ \n\n  If you dodge with 0 LP, you'll just drop to -10 LP. But it will still take 4 losses for you to fall back to your previous rank. I strongly recommend you watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1Ji2SjgVSA) to understand it better.\n\n> I have reported numerous trolls/flamers/feeders and I have got only one response that \"thanks to my report a player was punished etc etc.\" only one out of 50 (in the new season) and another 200 from before reports.\n\n+ Actually that notification is very rare, you'll only be notified under specific conditions, such as not being in-game or champion select, not queuing for a while... etc.\n\n Most of your reports would have gone through, but you wouldn't have been notified about them, because you were in queue or game at the time.\n\n Please keep this in mind when reporting. You'll punish many more people than you're told about, especially in text based trolling cases.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-02-05T12:58:56.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Silver promos.\n\nOur nasus at 0/10/0 at one point because they were sulking about a failed gank attempt from our jg.\n\nThen we had a teemo top. no tanks, no CC, no engage gg.\n\nI know it isn't every match but fucking hell they make it a chore to play.","replies":[]}]}
