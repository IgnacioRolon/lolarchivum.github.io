Iv been busy all day and i wanted to come home to play some league with my friends to be met by a firewall error on the patcher, this was a first for me. I looked up every fix i could and nothing worked. Iv had a similar problem to this before but not quite the same. After giving up on all the other fixes, ie turning off firewall and antiviruses, deleting some files and letting it try to fix them, i tried to hard repair with the options, but the firewall error stopped that as well, after an hour of letting it repair it finally said sorry, cant repair, firewall error. So i uninstalled, i went to reinstall the game, but I CANT GET ON THE INSTALL PART OF THE WEBSITE. I click Download Game Oceania, Windows. It goes to an error everytime, tried changing it to the NA version and it did the same. I went to go to the support page to write a ticket, and that didnt work either, the page would not load. My internet is at a steady 12.6 mbps and EVERY other webpage is working perfectly. This is not an error on my end i just have literally no idea how this has happened and what to do to fix it. Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"godsmustbecrazy3","date":"2015-01-16T16:18:27.496+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically have been getting the error message -\n\"Could not connect to the HTTP server.
