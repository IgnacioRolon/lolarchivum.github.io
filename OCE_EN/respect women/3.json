Second time posting. My game has been broken since the previous patch, i would open the launcher, it would take 5 minutes then say firewall internet connection error, i tried to reinstall, so i uninstalled it, went to your site to install and it didn't work. Tried to make a ticket, didn't work. This has to be a problem on your end. I have opened ports, i have unblocked your ports on firewall, i have turned off firewall, I have rebooted router, i have rebooted computer, i have flushed dns. The one time i got a reply from a rioter was a link to your support page, WHICH I CANT EVEN GET TO. this is literally the only way i can get help from you. \r\nmy internet is 12mbps+, my internet provider is TPG. I have tried (pretty sure) everything on my end. There are a lot of others with the same issue. I have spent over 300$ on this game and have been playing for 4 years, it is very frustrating not being able to play with my friends or get in on this new ranked season when i finally get a holiday. I feel under valued and unappreciated as a paying customer.\r\nPlease. Help.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-01-24T02:30:37.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi\n\nWe've had quite a few reports of players with TPG having this kind of issue.  There is a [sticky thread](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/I8XUgB8w-rads-error-or-unable-to-connect-to-supportriotgamescom) in this forum with some further information.\n\nThe long and short is that you may be able to workaround this by changing your DNS server on your computer to use one of Google's DNS servers, instead of TPG's.  There are some instructions on the riot games support site, which I'll relay here as the problem you are having is preventing you from reading them.\n\nThese are for Windows 7, so other versions might differ slightly.\n\n* Open the Start Menu\n* Open Control Panel\n* Select \"Network and Internet\"\n\n* Select \"Network and Sharing Center\"\n* Select \"Change Adapter Settings\" on the navigation bar on the left\n* Right click on your network adapter and select \"Properties\"\n* Select \"Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)\" and open Properties\n* Go to the bottom of the menu and change 'Obtain DNS server address automatically,' to 'Use the following DNS server addresses:'\n* Put in the following public DNS servers, one in each empty field:\n * 8.8.8.8 \n * 8.8.4.4\n* Save your changes by selecting \"Ok\"\n* Close all open web browsers and applications\n* Press the Windows Key\n* In the Search bar type *command prompt*\n* Right click on the result and select Run as Administrator\n* In the command prompt type* ipconfig /flushdns* and press Enter.\n* Restart your computer","replies":[{"poster":"Respect Women","date":"2015-01-24T03:49:23.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow man, i think you mightve fixed it... i was almost going to not try it because i'd tried it before, but this time it worked some how. Guh all this time wasted for something so simple!\nMaybe you guys should get this out there too, i know there's quite a lot of people having this issue, maybe this could be the issue to the firewall ingame problem as well. \n\nThanks a bunch for the help buddy i really appreciate it.\nTime to crush some poor souls in league! ;D... once its done downloading.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-01-24T07:51:35.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad to hear it worked for you!\n\nSee you on the rift! :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-01-24T02:31:56.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For Mac:\n\n* Open System Preferences\n* Open the Network preference pane\n* Select the active connection on the left, and click the \"Advanced...\" button in the lower right hand corner\n* Click \"DNS\" from the selection bar.\n* Remove any current DNS entries, and input the following public DNS servers:\n * 8.8.8.8 \n * 8.8.4.4\n* Save your changes by selecting \"OK\"\n* Apply the changes by clicking \"Apply\" in the lower right hand corner","replies":[]}]}]}
