Because I&rsquo;ve gotten to Gold V then dropped straight to Silver IV 0 LP due to teammates always flaming, feeding and occasionally me. 1/10 games will be my fault yet the rest is always someone else.\r\n\r\nI&rsquo;m currrntky a jg main with most likely a 26% win rate. Check my match history and no joke don&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m bad bc all those games I get fed early yet my team somehow feeds more. I just want to cover a few topics\r\n\r\nThe Aspect of Carrying - Does this exist, my personal opinion on it is of which it means you helped the team the most but not guaranteed the victory. When players post these types of discussions others just say get good or you suck or carry which don&rsquo;t seem to exist in this game what so ever.\r\n\r\nYou Get Fed But You Feed - Thus happens 80% of my games, I get fed and I will say nice work guys yet my team will some how feed more than I get them fed causing me to feed too????. It&rsquo;s kinda unfair but why am I still in Silver? It&rsquo;s harder enough trying to get out and even if I play a different role other than jg some one will feed still or jg won&rsquo;t gank\r\n\r\nWhat do I do?","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-05-26T06:54:47.982+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The short answer is yes.\n\nI see that you have switched to Kha'Zix - that's a good idea, you have to solo carry scrubs most of the time in this game. But make sure that if you are fed that you DON'T DIE! very important, because the monkeys are nothing without the zookeeper. Imo I would think that more reliable ways to carry would be mid laner or adc. Or even a split pushing top laner like tryndamere.\n\nOCE macro is the worst in the world, kids have no clue what to do after laning. They don't know how to rotate, position in teamfights, lane assignments, vision control before objectives, baiting, using the fog of war, etc etc - I could go on. Until you reach about Diamond 2, the games will be absolute garbage in terms of quality. Get through the cringe and then real league begins where you can actually enjoy the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phyreflie","date":"2018-05-26T00:45:14.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"git gud","replies":[]}]}
