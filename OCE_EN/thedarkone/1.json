Now I've been just stuck with these just really stupid players in bronze. Like wow just finished a game with inspired me to create this post, Pantheon top,  Annie mid 1/9, Nunu supp 0/4, team refuses to leash jungler because it's 'too far away', so being the charmer he was he just afk'd and me adc 5/5. This is a typical bronze match for me. I try so hard to communicate with the team but it's bronze no one listens to anyone. I've found adc is the best position for me to 'carry' as I have won the most games playing it. Is there anyone kind enough to give me some tips to get out of Bronze or carry me out?","replies":[{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2014-12-31T01:34:23.026+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went 26/0 as vayne and still lost because of the team. I need a duo carry or something\nThat's ur problem. You need to get over people being bad and focus purely on you. Your mindset it seems is already \"all about me\" Imagine if you had 12 kills as vayne instead of 26, and ur apc had 8 of those kills and ur jungler had 6. You need to share kills. Regardless of weather they're bad or not, sharing is caring. By stealing all of the kills you steal all the gold avaliable for other people, any wonder you think ur teams are %%%% they have no gold to buy items while you get it all.\nEven if someone is bad they can still cast spells and use auto attacks, and more money for them=more dmg for the team.\nThese are just some things I notice adcs doing that can jeopardise your teams effectiveness. \nPushing other peoples lanes as an excuse to get big waves, stealing jungle camps and buffs without asking for them (buffs are your junglers present to give, not your property to take) and the obvious problem here, taking more kills than you need.\n\nIt may not feel right giving kills to your team if they're just plain %%%%, and maybe sometimes you will indeed solo carry you way to victory, but this play-style sets you up for a real %%%%ty time when you move up the leagues where everyone expects team play, not complete selfishness.\n\nThis is how I Learnt to get over nubs in bronze and I escaped successfully, I'm no pro but managed a 67% win rate with nautilus doing this play style, NAUTILUS, the one champ with removes the hyper from hyper carry :P if i can do it, you can do.\n\n\nGLHF bra","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-31T05:03:25.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"btw, trist can kite a naut to hell and back...not sure how he counters hypercarries....\n\nhell, jax rips his little face off.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDarkOne","date":"2014-12-31T01:43:26.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some good tips in here thanks, :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Contrakt","date":"2014-12-30T23:50:25.107+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheDarkOne,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=Nu63EIm4,comment-id=,timestamp=2014-12-30T22:23:11.547+0000)\n>\n>Is there anyone kind enough to give me some tips to get out of Bronze or carry me out?\n\nFocus on your CS, don't die, don't flame, mute the enemy team, mute your team if they're flaming.\nGo watch some high level streams, they're usually good at teaching skills to carry low elo games.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDarkOne","date":"2014-12-31T00:24:54.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know I'm not a noob, I know how to farm and last hit, I went 26/0 as vayne and still lost because of the team.

Dragon is OP as hell if you have 5 of them and the enemy team has none.\nWards! Buy a pink early and drop it somewhere. Get your duo to do the same. In bronze, half the time people never even kill them, so you have permanent vision of 2 places on the map the whole game if this works out... Use greens as well whenever possible.\nPractise these things in normals, and when you are feeling comfortable you can do it all well and win > 50% of your games, then go into ranked and do the same.\n\nYou WILL get LOADS of trolls in games still, and you will lose a heap of games because of them. Just remember that the people on the other team are probably trolling as well just as often as your team is. If you can win > 50 of the games without trolls, you will climb, even if it's slowly.\n\nJust give it time, and ignore the games lost due to trolls. Concentrate on winning the game without them.\n\nI'm up to B1 again now, so hopefully I can climb out too when I get a chance to play more! :)\n\nGood luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-31T04:58:03.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"communication doesnt win bronze games. solo carrying does.\n\nfind a champ or role you can effectively carry from in a high % of games.\nstomp your lane, and if its mid or bot, use it to roam. if top, push 2-3 towers before roaming.\ntry reset killers like kat and akali. or just insane lane winners like fizz syndra.\nor really strong safe ADCs like trist and corki.\nor massive powerhouse top laners like panth nasus and J4.\nor early game junglers who dont fall off if played well like lee WW (a rushed lvl 6 is still decently early enough to impact the game quickly) panth and vi.\n\ni recommend not playing jungle or support, as you usually still rely on your team a lot in those roles.\nif you can get ahead early enough you can secure dragons and towers with any of the carry lanes. and a TP top laner can help with decent pushes or dragons if the timing works out.\n\neither way, its not hard to get out of bronze. its just really slow if you have been there for a long time. as your MMR gains are pitiful once you have over 100 games in a tier/league.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2014-12-31T02:35:31.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey I got in to B3 don't give up you will climb out one day I'm now in S4 because I didn't give up it takes time but you will get there","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akuen","date":"2014-12-31T01:37:25.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is all you need to do: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrED-AfQluM&index=5","replies":[]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2014-12-31T00:52:28.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is a golden Ranked Logic example.
