I did climb to Bronze 2 last season from 4, which I did this season to. Currently though I&#039;m having a streak of just horrible teams. You&#039;ve heard this all before from every bronze player ever but I genuinely don&#039;t belong in bronze. I main Varus, 50 games 3+ KDA and over 50% w/r. I cs well and call objectives never over extend and all the rest. But honestly some games there is always someone who feeds, someone who is toxic to the feeder and someone who tells them to stfu and gets involved in the argument. I like playing competitive ranked games but stuck with these players leaving me to deal with the poorly initiated fights which we have no chance winning, then getting flamed because it was my fault that we lost them is pretty lame.\nJust looking for anyone at all who would duo with me, help me out. I don&#039;t care if you&#039;re a plat/gold who&#039;s bored or you&#039;re in the same situation as me. Just want to win.\n\nFlick me a friend request.","replies":[{"poster":"Vantage Point","date":"2015-04-27T09:06:45.283+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would reccomend taking this to 'Team Recruitment' board. As for actual feedback I would reccomend using a wide range of champions and roles, also, play what's on the meta for your role e.g. recently Sejuani jungle. And if you have more than 50% winrate it shouldn't take too long too climb out, depending on your total games. I was put in Bronze IV at the end of season 3 (I was desperate for any kind of reward). I got to Bronze I by the end of the season but ran out of time before I could get to Silver. Playing meta champions I find is very important (if you are comfortable with them only!) , and while you may main Varus, keep in mind every champion has a role in certain comps, so pick an ADC (assuming you are ADC) that compliments your team. \n\nAnd one thing to note is that 'picks' isn't a team comp.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-04-26T05:51:01.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah dude you can get out. It is frustrating when you carry games yet your team still wants to ff etc etc. If you're good enough, you'll EVENTUALLY climb out dude. Keep on keeping on.. Silver is bronze so it shouldn't be too hard. We all know the struggles of bronze.","replies":[]}]}
