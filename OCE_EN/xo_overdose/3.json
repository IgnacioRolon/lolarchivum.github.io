I want to achieve high ELO putting in my absolute best of efforts.\r\nWith the Mac client, it's literally impossible to climb because every single game you enter, there is a risk you will be ruining the game for not only yourself, but  for 4 other team-mates who have no idea why you keep disconnecting/freezing/dropping fps, which immediately creates anger and frustration within these team-mates, which will lead to unnecessary reports. My last couple of ranked games I've entered, I've lost, simply because I let everyone down.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-21T07:46:24.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suggest you don't play ranked till it's fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"XO Overdose","date":"2014-12-21T12:14:24.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I decided to re-install the game, I can't even install it because it goes to 33% and the actual client shuts down.\nI can't even.\nRiot, please.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-23T07:51:33.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, that sounds like a connection issue, not something which is Mac specific. Common solutions are to try manually setting your DNS, use a VPN (only while patching), triple check your firewall is allowing ALL instances of League to run (sometimes it blocks a specific version of League because it's new), etc.\n\nIf you were able to install League at any point in your computer's lifespan, then it's most likely a connection issue.","replies":[{"poster":"XO Overdose","date":"2014-12-23T12:46:39.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I fixed the installation issue, I manually stopped the Rads User Kernel process during the installation and it didn't crash during the rest of the installation at all.
