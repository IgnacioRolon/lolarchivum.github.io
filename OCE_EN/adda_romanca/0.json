We had LotPK for so long because it's Snowdown and it was a traditionally Snowdown gamemode, just as we had Doom Bots for Harrowing.\n\nThe reason modes like URF don't see much time on the RGM queue is because it's a mode that people get burnt out on very quickly, so having more time between its appearances means more enjoyment for everyone once it does come back.","replies":[{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-12-29T14:58:23.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about N.U.R.F. ?

Then you consider that I had stated that \"this was the first time we've had the same mode *more than 2 weeks in a row*\", so your point about Nexus Siege, OFA, URF and Doombots are not relevant to what I've stated. WE also had Ascension for a couple weeks recently however that was after Riots announcement about slowing down the queue.\n\nI certainly wouldn't say that the schedule is \"messed up\", it's just not how anyone would've thought it would go down during the Christmas/New Years period.
