When my internet is working perfectly fine, and cannot be connected to the game,\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t think this is fair for players, where it is not actually their fault for getting disconnected and their internet working perfectly fine but its your unstable server problem and getting 4 games low que priority waiting for 20 minutes each game wasting my time and getting me really pissed off about this problem.\r\n\r\nNOT ONCE, BUT IT&#039;S ALREADY BEEN SEVERAL TIMES I HAD TO SUFFER THIS,\r\n\r\nDO SOMETHING,","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-02-11T10:01:57.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nAny downtime or issues relating to server stability will be posted on the Service Status page, most of the time issues you feel MUST be on Riots end, really are not. Your connection being stable to other services such as youtube, or even other games does not reflect your connection to League of Legends as the data would be following a different route.\n\nCould you do the following for me to help better determine the nature of your issues,\n\n* [Switch to a public DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5)\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP. (Allow this to run for 5-15 minutes)\n  * 103.240.227.5\n* Once adequate time has passed, stop the traceroute, export your results as text.\n* Run the [ICSI netalyzr](http://netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/).\n* Post back with a link to your WinMTR results (You can use [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/) for this) and the direct url to your ICSI netalyzr results.","replies":[]}]}
