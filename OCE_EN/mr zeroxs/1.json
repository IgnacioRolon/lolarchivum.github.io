I want to improve myself but I want to know what to improve myself to. (How many cs I should have at 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes etc in Bronze and also in Silver to know what I need to work towards to get to the next level of play.) I know it must be hilarious to you high ELO players that a Bronze player thinks he can better himself, but I&#039;m motivated and I just want to better at the game I&#039;m in love with. Thanks all. :)\n\n**EDIT:** Just wanted to link my op.gg just in case anyone can give me any tips as to what I'm doing wrong. Yes I know I'm horrible, don't worry about that haha... :)\n[LINK TO MY OP.GG HERE!](http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=NoxilianPrince)","replies":[{"poster":"B I G K R 1 Tt","date":"2018-04-10T23:22:56.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry about CS, farm kills","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Zeroxs","date":"2018-04-11T05:52:03.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry about buying wards either right?\nOh also don't bother about building tank because the only way people die is damage...\nI know what I'm doing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Scottez","date":"2018-04-10T13:55:25.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just some tips if you want to get better\n\ntl;dr watch youtube vids and streamers. learn wave managment, cs abuse and understanding summunor spells.\n\n1) Learn wave management (lots of vids on yt). That has to be one of the most important skills as a laner, especially toplane. It allows you optimize back timings to come back to lane whilst not missing much cs, take advantage of lane leads and also understand when you have a situation where your losing and the enemy laner is aggressive and your starting to get a lane push and therefor have a bigger badass wave that will help you surprise your opponent if he goes aggressive on you. All of this and more will be explained in the vids on yt.\n\n2) Csing itself as mentioned below. Cannons are worth a lot more gold now, when the cannon is low, (the following applies to all cs type) this gives you an opportunity to either get some poke on the enemy laner or miss but make him miss the cannon. Understand that he will most likely looking to do this to you as well so when you are going to last hit the cannon, be conscious of that. 10 cs per min is exceptional cs per min and is usually only seen in higher elos, so don't be too down on yourself if your at 6 cs per min. as a bronze player if you can try to manage 8 cs per min in the early game, that in of itself will make you climb because you will have more gold. \n\n3) Taking tp vs taking lane summoner. If you want to get better at toplane you have to understand the spells taken. In the case where you have tp. Your not looking to win lane and snowball hard (i'm not telling you to play passively, snowball lane if you can), your looking to make tp plays on the botlane, where you have the opportunity to pickup 2 kills and then a followup drag. Tp can also be taken into hard lanes where you will need to back constantly for health/mana. Taking tp on scaling/defensive champs is fairly general on what you do. However when you take tp on an aggressive laner such as aatrox (for example) that has a strong early game (lvls 1-5), you want to take aggressive trades and force your laner to back. Push out your wave (first tip) then walk back to lane where the enemy will most likely use tp, so now you have the tp adv. Now you need to ask your bot to ward deep and wait for the bot lvl 6/7 skirmish (can happen earlier or not at all). Something you should ask for your botlane to do is to last hit only and try to have the wave at their tower so the tp will be far enough behind the enemy botlane, that they can't escape and usually ends up in 2 kills and a drag.\n\n4) tips tailored to you. Always buy ninja tabi boots, unless your against an ap top and ap mid with tank jg, take merc treads. Take revitalize (the middle rune on bottom row of of resolve tree, mundo has so much healing that its far better to buff that then get a % of max hp bonus, abd the same goes for nasus and his passive. Also if your against a lot of cc and they have an ad mid/top (including tanks) take ninja tabi as your boots, but take the precision tree as your secondary rune page and get the tenacity rune with the triumph rune. Your warding is far above the bronze standard, so keep that up. Watch streams and watch yt vids on how to play mid and late game, it will most likely open you up to things you hadn't previously thought of and even better, try to find someone who makes mundo and/or nasus vids and learn from them. Last hitting is very important, just practice in a custom game vs hardest difficulty bots (or friends) and focus only on csing to start, once you have gotten good at that, play the lanes properly where you poke, while trying to dodge poke, while getting the cs, while trying to make your laner miss cs.\n\n\nMsg me if you want my profile and i can run you through a lot of stuff after you have read this post and learnt a bit. Advanced stuff can't be taught by simply telling you, you will need to get experience first so you can comprehend what is trying to be taught","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Zeroxs","date":"2018-04-10T18:57:03.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woah.. Thanks for the huge essay haha, but seriously though appreciated. I'll try to work on those things - I do need to work on cs. The reasons my warding is decent is because I was the NA LCS a lot and warding is just one of the easiest things to pick up compared to macro and stuff. Thanks, will get in contact soon! :)\n\nEDIT: I remembered that I was struggling with learning wave management from videos - the only thing I really took away from an hour of watching them was just to watch out for minion damage cause it hurts.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-04-10T08:43:23.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just as a note, it's generally recommended that you have 100 cs for every 10 minutes of play (100 at 10 minutes, 200 at 20 minutes etc.), mind you you could probably \"afford\" a 10 CS \"buffer\" on that (90 cs for every 10 minutes of play) and *still* be doing better than the majority of the community.\n\nI'm not sure if they'd have it, but you could try websites like \"lolking\" for these kinds of statistics.\n\nThat said, a reliable source for various average statistics at different levels of play would be a *great* feature for Riot to add on the website, in-client, or both.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Zeroxs","date":"2018-04-10T11:40:22.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, I'm looking for over the course of the game however, so I can see where the cs spikes and drops, like it'd drop around 15-20 minutes when you group and then peak when you split...
