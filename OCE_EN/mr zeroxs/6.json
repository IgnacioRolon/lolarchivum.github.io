We used to have multiple requirements, these included to upload highlights etc... These requirements have been removed, _now what is required of you is:\n- To be in Platinum or higher.\n- Retain loyalty, if you want to play representing us, you need to be able to stay to complete the season._\nWhat we&#039;re looking at to do in RKLe5, is to play games in a team environment - while playing competitively too, we won&#039;t be doing much to do with tournaments for the first few weeks/months as we will be training together, this is to make us better players before we introduce/re-enter you in to the competitive scene.** _If interested please add me on Discord: Pepe#5417._**\nThanks for your time, keen to talk to you! :)","replies":[]}
