It took me about 70 or so games to go from Bronze 2 in to silver. I skipped a division from Silver 4-&gt; Silver 2 and after the end of the season i managed to crawl into bronze. How many games would it of taken for a normal person? During my time climbing i have also noticed people who are just bad at the game will riot actually ban people who are boosted???????","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-01-09T12:39:38.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**I skipped a division from Silver 4-> Silver 2 and after the end of the season i managed to crawl into bronze**\n\nlul wut.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AdoIf Tiltler","date":"2016-01-08T23:30:18.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering it took me 2 years to go from b2 to g3 yeah that is fast, gj!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-01-08T10:02:52.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Congratulations on the climb :-)","replies":[]}]}
