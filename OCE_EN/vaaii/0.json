Just wondering if anyone else has been getting a higher ping then usual after the new patch. \r\n\r\nI'm with TPG and before the patch I would get a steady 40 ping. After the patch I've been getting 80's, generally hovering more toward 100 and spiking even higher at times. Very frustrating as a Lee player when you ward hops take a second to even recognize making your kicks go off angle ^_^;.  \r\nI've also noticed when I leave the main home screen open as I do other things it will disconnect from PvP every now and then.  I haven't changed any of my settings on my computer or router since (unless my brother has) so I was wondering if anyone has any ideas on the issue. \r\n\r\nThanks in advanced! \r\nVaaii\r\n\r\nNote: I was one of the people affected by the TPG login issues a while back as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Jonius7","date":"2015-02-22T08:10:26.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I started having similar problems in the last 24 hours, strangely. My usual ping is 50, but it seems to fluctuate around 200, and very unstable, sometimes going 500+ making LoL much harder to play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-19T04:52:42.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I'm with TPG\n\nMay the ping gods have mercy on your soul.\n\n[Have you changed your DNS yet?](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq4) If that doesn't work, you can try [disabling your IPv6](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3). If the word \"disabling\" sounds dangerous to you, then that's because it is. The only reason Riot suggest it is because League is using the older technology to connect to the net, and thus disabling the newer one *might* fix connection/ping issues you're having.\n\nWhatever you do, just remember what your settings were previously. You might need to take them back.\n\nBest of luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Vaaii","date":"2015-02-19T05:31:44.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah changing the DNS settings didn't really change much from what I can tell. Still hovering around 80-100 ping and getting that pvp connection message when I get out of games or leave it open. It's just the message though never seems to be disconnected for long and seems to be connected enough for it not to affect the game when I'm in besides the lag. Hmmm... any other ideas guys?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-19T08:42:00.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, there was this one thing, about TCP timestamps; lemme rummage a bit, I'll get back to you soon.\n\nEdit: Okay, found it. [This is a guide on how to disable Nagle's algorithm.](http://lifeandcode.net/2009/05/reduce-game-network-latency-in-windows-7-or-vista/comment-page-1/) To quote, \"also commonly known as TCP no delay, which is basically an optimization of network traffic that tries to reduce overall packet volume but can cause extra latency in the connection.\"\n\nThe instructions are for Windows 7 and Vista, but it's the exact same for Windows 8 as well.\n\nIf you can't view the instructions for some reason, or they're hard to follow, just say so and I'll rephrase them here.\n\nAlso, be sure to create a backup of your current registry before attempting this, so that if you stuff up your connection, you can easily restore it. To do that, in regedit, click File>Export. Saves your entire registry, which you can load in by selecting File>Import.\n\nBest of luck!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
