Additionally, you being away from that game does not guarantee that your team will lose. Would you still give loss prevented if your team had won?\n\nAlso I don't think they'd all report you. You weren't afk, you didn't connect, and people understand that others have technical issues at times.\n\nAnyway, about the game, I'd say avoid playing for a while. There's some issues going on with the servers, and I have no idea what's being done about it. Wait for a few days, and then reply to this message.","replies":[]}]}
