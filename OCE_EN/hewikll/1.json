Get  used to the chaos that results from this until you settle into a rank above or below mid silver (where you face constant people on placement).  Mind you, sometimes I get diamonds who are great mechanically, but know nothing of the mode and end up feeding, as they can't ward and don't get the map very well.\n\nPlacements always have a tendency to wild swings in rank at the best of times.  Sorry if you wanted to get TT to gold by seasons end, a lot of people are having that idea now, and most have to get that even if they are plat in solo queue, they have to learn the new mode, and it's going to take 100+ games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2017-10-22T10:59:40.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your MMR without rank is off the charts and be placed with different ranks. my first placement I was placed with a diamond and still friends with him till now :)  so each game you play will determine your MMR as you play more. Usually after 4 games you either snowball in rank or pair'd with low elo.\n\nSo for now: hang in there, and good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Hewikll","date":"2017-10-22T11:02:33.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get what your saying but this wasn't early in the placements. this was the 10th match where elo should be fairly settled and not super biased. If i was around bronze level i should not have been anywhere near a gold-plat matchup.","replies":[{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2017-10-22T11:10:28.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its often people being placed in silver - bronze would mean losing 60% of your placement but I get what you mean it is totally unfair losing to high elo and ruining experience because you wouldnt have had the chance to win lane or game. But it might have been their MMR being low or duo'ing with a low elo partner.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
