Reckon Sol&#039;s Q should get double tap so he isn&#039;t quite so ballbreakingly weak to melee. just think an full ult cd on his only means to do anything to melee champs on his face is a bit much isn&#039;t it?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-19T22:44:22.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While Id love to see Sol's Q being able to be double tapped (He is one of my 3 mains)\n\nHe is already terribly strong, and the only thing you can do to counter him is to get inside the stars. and if you can double tap Q, that removes this counter play from him.\n\nAtm he gets shat on by Fizz and Yasuo etc, but thats his trade off for dealing so much sustained damage.\n\nRiot says they are re-working him though to make him less hard-countered. \nSo if that does go ahead, we will have to see what they do.","replies":[{"poster":"Hewikll","date":"2017-04-20T05:59:13.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do understand what your saying about strengths and weaknesses but doesn't only 1 survival mechanic that's on an ults cd no less a bit to extreme?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-20T07:12:01.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats why he is hard to play, he does a lot of damage and can baby-sit another lane all the way to victory.\n_(he almost guarantees that your vayne will get fed) _\n\nSo he does need some pretty ruthless trade offs. \n\nI agree that it might be a bit too ruthless, seeming theres literally nothing he can do against champs like Fizz or Yasuo.\nBut i don't think doubletapping Q is the answer, its up way too often, so it wouldn't allow all in champions to get enough time to take him out.\n\nAnyway, Sol is all about positioning, if you're good enough, it should be really difficult for people to get inside your stars, unless they have super engage potential.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
