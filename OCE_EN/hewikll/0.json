I finally got 2 team mates to help me kill it but the enemy jungler alone stopped that attempt. 20 min baron Nashor appeared, became the hunted camp. At 25 Min the hunt mark disappeared presumably to rng another camp to hunt but Baron Nashor again and I couldn&#039;t hunt.\nThe game ended shortly after 31min. from aprox. 16 min till the end of the match the Hunted camp was rift herald/Baron, 15 minutes of not being able to get stacks from enemy camps I had fallen so far behind I was useless.\nI feel that this is not a matter of personal skill or counter skill by the opponent but rather a rng pimpslap against Kindred.\n\nRunning count of times hunted camp has landed on Baron and NEVER moved after: 3","replies":[{"poster":"sad little benju","date":"2015-12-01T01:57:43.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry hewk, I see so many more kindred players in high plat.

(to prevent you just farming up and becoming invincible) \n\nThe marks on baron nashor and rift herald are 'on top of' not 'instead of' normal camps, hence they are a buff to kindred, not a disadvantage. They will NOT prevent you hunting other camps.\n\nthe marks on baron and herald are the only jungle camps that will spawn marks after you reach 6 stacks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-30T06:38:42.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"try doing proper ganks with her then","replies":[{"poster":"Hewikll","date":"2015-11-30T06:42:05.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really?! this isn't about the ganking part of Kindred's passive","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-11-30T22:40:23.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to agree with talon12 I get 6/10+ stakes from ganking in a game were as only 3/6 from camps","replies":[]}]}]}]}
