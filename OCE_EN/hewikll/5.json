To be concise I believe that Anivia is now mechanically underpowered, to clarify I do not mean the numbers of each skill rather her kit as a whole. To my perspective (which I recognise as imperfect) I can only see this underpowered state to be resolved by a proper rework, precisely: her passive, her Q and her E. To try and resolve this with just changing numbers and shifting power will only give rise to another problem and a complaint.\r\n\r\nNow a more in-depth explanation for what I have stated.\r\nAnivia&#039;s underperformance\r\nWith the 6.23 nerfs to Anivia&#039;s E skill&#039;s double damage component she now truly struggles to react and exert a pressured laning phase, Her Q skill&#039;s truly awful speed makes it a very hard skill to rely on for exerting pressure and threatening a lane opponent and now to proc the E&#039;s double damage the Q mustn where once simply getting a hit but missing the stun was enough. The lesser of these problems is the stun for damage component in that it takes a very quick reaction to avoid the stun after having been hit by the first tick of damage but it happens enough to warrant mention especially when trying to land a double hit on the Q. The greater problem is the travel speed of this skill which renders it one of the easiest skill to dodge even for immobile targets which makes using it offensively a very risky action by virtue of a skilled opponent engaging after a miss when you are extremely vulnerable.\r\n\r\nThe E skill double damage component was nerfed also with respect to Anivia&#039;s R with it now taking a fully charged R as the condition for successful double damage. It now has a 1.5 second minimum wait time in which an opponent will see themselves outside of the ultimate by as much as walking. This hurts immensely due to restricting reactionary responses to an opponents actions and engaging on anyone because they can just walk out of it. now it can be said that by utilising anivias kit in its entirety it cannot be escaped by immobile opponent but this is to much to lead in with, trying to start an engage with every tool at your disposal leaves you an a position where you can do nothing should you fail to secure a kill. Unfortunatly a great many of the meta mid laners either outrange or outmanoeuvre Anivia so this is not even an option as an engage.\r\n\r\nBetween both of these new interactions in Anivia&#039;s kit it has forced her into a passive midlaner that now focuses solely on farming and team fights because her solo engage dynamic has be curbed to where it is unacceptably risky to engage. To which end there are now few midlaners that are countered by Anivia&#039;s kit yet Anivia is truly vulnerable against and unable to engage and trade with most midlaners.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin the patch notes Riot cited that they implemented these changes in response to &quot;instant, unavoidable burst and lane pressure&quot; and this is a good thing to achieve making Anivia a more balance champion however the implementation to see this happen is far to restrictive and removes far to much of her dynamic in solo engages and laning. To see both less overbearing and more skillful interaction with but not rendering Anivia underpowered I think a proper rework needs to occur with respect to her passive, Q and E, her W and R being in a good position to my view.\r\n\r\nTo say her passive can change in implementation of seeing Anivia as a less overbearing yet balanced champion is probably the least expected point, but I say this because in my personal experience from S1 to current League there has been a power creep in almost every aspect of the game from systemic changes to see the game become more frenetic with faster pace orientated engagements leaving her passive in the position of being increasingly unreliable and frustrating to utilise.\r\n\r\nHer Q could be reworked or buffed as is with higher missile speed so it could actually be threatening in offensive use.\r\n\r\nThe clearest and most pertinent point of rework could be to rework that which is in contention; her E. As is it is not a mechanical skill, activate and click on target. There is a myriad of potential mechanics that could be added to see the overbearing simplicity of point and click removed.\r\n\r\nIn summation Anivia&#039;s position is one of being underpowered by virtue of lacking solo dynamics.\r\n\r\nAnivia is my favourite champion within the league and I would love to see discussions of Anivia&#039;s balance continue and perhaps get Riot to action a more balanced state for this champion.","replies":[]}
