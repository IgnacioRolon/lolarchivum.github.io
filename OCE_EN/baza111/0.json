Unless you have a friend teaching you everything about the game every game you play until you hit 30 then there is a lot more things will need to learn. A few things that are gonna help you a lot when you get to ranked are:\n1) A good idea of all the items, what they do and what champions work best with them. I went into ranked when I reached 30 thinking that as an ADC I should build some defensive items if I was getting hit with too much dmg, and although its ok to buy a defensive item it is a much better idea to just stack offensive items for at least 4-5 of your first items. If you don't you just fall further and further behind and can't do your job in your team. Things like that are very important to learn as you go through the game. \n2) A general understanding of most champions. You don't have to play them all but it's not gonna be a good time if you end up in a lane without knowing anything about the enemy champion. \n3) Wards! buy twice as many and use them twice as often! if you never buy/use them look up some guides on youtube and just get used to using them early before you even get to ranked. They are super important, trust me! They don't seem like it but they really are!\n4) Practice! You are gonna do better on a champion you feel comfortable with than a champion that is supposed to be \"good\" buy some statistics about win rates or whatever. Even if your champions you play are the least played champions in the game with the lowest win rate you can beat any champion if you have played with them for like the last 20 games and they have only just picked them up. \n5) This is quite possibly the most important tip: Have fun! You are just straight up not going to do well if you are angry annoyed or in just a negative attitude. Its not worth getting all hung up on any toxic behaviour you get through the game. Just mute the player, relax, enjoy the plays you make and have fun! That will give you a massive edge over anyone who is raging! and this tip applies to all levels of the game.\nI am sure there are a few other tips that would help you but to sum it up: Have good game knowledge, have lots of experience, ward more (even more than that!), practice up and have fun! These might not seem that useful now, but if you keep them in mind as you climb up through the levels then I am sure that they will help you from level 1 :) GL HF\noh also one last thing I forgot! Is work on your minion kills (CS) every game! Set yourself little challenges to kill more minions than last game. make that just as important as getting kills because most of the time it only takes like 10-20 minions to get the same gold as a kill. so It is very important to make sure you are getting as many as possable.

As a beginner it shouldn't matter too much what you do, just as long as you're having fun.\n\nBut here's some stuff that might help you anyway:\n\n+ **Champions **\nIf you don't really mind what kind of champions you play, I'd recommend playing **Tanks**. It's hard to mess up on a tank, especially in lower tiers, but you can still be impactful.\n\n You can tell when a champion is a tank, by clicking on them in the store. On the overview tab, you'll see the _\"attributes\"_. If it says tank somewhere in the attributes, then you're good.\n\n Here's some champions I'd recommend. These guys are really easy to play, but still really strong:\n\n {{champion:54}} **Malphite**, {{champion:32}} **Amumu**, {{champion:14}} **Sion**, {{champion:86}} **Garen**, {{champion:57}} **Maokai**, {{champion:106}} **Volibear**, {{champion:36}} **Dr. Mundo** and {{champion:44}} **Taric\n**\n+ **Builds**\n This one is a bit important. Getting effective items on a champion, can completely change how strong they feel. I'd recommend using Moba Fire for your builds, [here](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/malphite-guide)'s an example for **Malphite**.\n\n Just look up any champion with that link, and you'll find a list of builds. Make sure you don't play a **jungle** build in the **top lane **though!\n\n+ **Learn the champions**\n At this stage you probably don't know all the champions, and don't know what they can do. Your _**number 1**_ job is to learn what each champion can do. \n\n Every time you get in-game and see a new champion, look them up on google. Riot has a great video series on Youtube as well, that you might want to watch. Here's one of their videos for **Poppy**\n\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oe-NJKTgz7c\n\n  _**You essentially just need to know what's going to happen with that champion in the game.**_ e.g\n  I need to be careful of {{champion:53}} **Blitzcrank**'s Hook\n  {{champion:154}} **Zac** can revive himself with his passive.\n  {{champion:28}} **Evelynn** can go invisible when not in combat.\n\n+ **CS**\n Try to get the last hit on the minions! You can get so much gold, when you get good at it. It'll take a while before you're any good, but keep it in mind for now.\n\nThat's about it, most of these you will learn with time, but I can put you ahead a few months by telling you what to look out for now.\n\nRemember most important thing is to have fun!","replies":[]},{"poster":"BadLuckFollowsMe","date":"2016-02-28T05:36:40.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, pre-30 nobody really cares what you do, so running down the team is irrelevant. Most of the people you'll be playing with will probably be people leveling smurfs anyway at this point, so I'd take this rare opportunity of being able to make whatever mistakes you want to just play everyone that you can and try and find something you like.\n\nAs for people to start with, anyone with a low level of mechanical skill is perfect. Ashe is great for that, as is Garen. Looking at the current free champions, I'd recommend Annie, Malphite, and Lulu. If you want to go slightly more complicated, Brand and practice comboing abilities together, or Morgana to practice skillshots and using your ultimate at the right time.\n\nAt some point you should give Nautilus a try as well. One of the simplest tanks out there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-02-28T05:07:40.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good champions to start off with are generally the ones on the free week rotation (the pre-level 5 rotation), or champions with a price tag of 450 IP.\n\n{{champion:1}} is super good as a support and midlane\n{{champion:22}} Good adc for learning the basics and kiting\n{{champion:86}} Good for top lane, you wont die much because he is super tank\n{{champion:32}} Good for jungle and learning skill shots, however I would leave jungle out till level 20 because doing it without runes and sufficient masteries is ridiculously hard. \n\nOthers include: {{champion:78}} {{champion:16}} (raka is super boring though), {{champion:89}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:44}} .\n\nGood luck, and feel free to post if you need any more help ♥","replies":[]},{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-02-28T05:04:41.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ADC: Ashe, very basic 1v1 ranged champ, a good base if you wanna go down this road\nTank: Garen, i personally haven't use him much, but seems like a good start\nMage: i don't know, i don't really do mages much. \nSupport: i started with Soraka, kinda hard to use, but is a good base for learning support\n\nwhat i would suggest is to play ai co-op alot with the weekly free champs\nread up on the abilities of each hero first, and see which one u like\nand play ai co-op to learn how to use the champ\nto get into more depth, you could watch some vids on youtube and see how other people play that champ\nonce u think u have enough knowledge, join a normal match to test out\n\ni'm also new, if you like feel free to add me in-game\ni am usually on after 7pm during week days, and when ever i am home during weekends\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]}
