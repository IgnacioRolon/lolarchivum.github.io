Im looking to grind to gold this season and hopefully platinum. I play alot and Im looking for people who want to que for rating. \n\nPreferably you know how to use curse and are very keen on winning games and not wasting time.  \n\nAbit about myself: I am going to be playing middle and jungle this season as Kayle only. I have 3400 games played on the champion over 2 accounts. If you play with me you can expect games of me carrying super duper hard. If I ever fall behind I always try to enable my team to carry through sharing my cooldowns and vision. \n\nI do tend to rage but never at duo partners and usually never to the point it impacts on the team. \n\n\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/tomjashroomzzz/profiles","replies":[{"poster":"Itstomuhohh","date":"2016-02-05T08:24:20.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still looking","replies":[]}]}
