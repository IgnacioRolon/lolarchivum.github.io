Retroactive or random banning isnt cool. Fuck you Riot.\n\n For all I know I could have been hacked and had jihadi John on my account and got me banned but no you cant add any details. Also if it was a tribunal ban fuck your tribunal. \n\nGuess Ill wait out the 2 weeks of apparent punishment (as far as im concerened I havent been proven to have done anything wrong). I sent an email to the player support people, no response ofc .","replies":[{"poster":"Itstomuhohh","date":"2015-03-06T07:46:31.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no it doesnt it tells me to look at my email....

They usually take around one working day to reply.\n\nAlso, if you try logging into League, doesn't it tell you why you were banned?","replies":[]}]}
