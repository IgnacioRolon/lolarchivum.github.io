I think that making promotions or giving or taking LP should be more based on the grade you get each game. Because I have had multiple games where some players have gone AFK but I have done okay and received a decent grade, either way i have been demoted because of my teams performance. That&#039;s where I think that ranking or giving LP should be placed on each individual players grade. That way they are ranked accordingly and can be satisfied with where they are. Lets say if a player gets an A, A-, S, S+ then that player should receive a larger amount of LP and or be ranked higher. If a player receives a B, B- etc then they are at the perfect rank for themselves because they aren&#039;t doing really well but they aren&#039;t doing bad either. So they should be given little to no LP. Finally if a player gets a C, D etc then they should be demoted or have LP taken away. But then flex is a different case. If people decide to queue up and join as a team then the ranking should be more team based, depending on how the team did in their games. Overall I think that the solo queue ranking and giving or receiving LP system should be changed and or modified. I understand that League is a team based game but I don&#039;t understand why i have to be punished for the way my team mates perform when I do well.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-01-06T10:12:00.740+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the person with the highest grade in a game isn't always the most deserving of victory.\n\n I mean it's often indicative, but that's only assuming a standard playstyle. It's very easy to abuse grading systems, and many people already have expertise in doing so, some people still religiously farm Hextech chests weekly and it doesn't take a good player to do so.\n\nThere are actually some very counterproductive ways to Hextech Grade Farm, that will both set your team behind, whilst increasing your end grade.\n\nIn the end, the game matches you with teammates and measures your ability to win based on each players match history. So over the large average, a good player will win slightly more often and climb. \n\nA grade based system might be more satisfying or more adaptive to a good player on paper, but long term players will break and abuse this system.","replies":[]}]}
