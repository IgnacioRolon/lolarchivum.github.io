I had a brutalizer and boots, and instead of buying Black Cleaver I clicked and bought the Skirmishers Sabre accidentally, and the item was instantly consumed and removed from my inventory. I lost over 2000 gold and had to rebuild brutalizer from scratch. This option was non refundable as well. Not a game breaking bug but it put me behind quite a bit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nasedra Rheold","date":"2014-12-03T05:36:33.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can still jungle without it but then again at 4v5 y would you. \n\nAlso the game is balenced around teams being even, i cant think of any game thats balences missing players (even wow's tenacity in pvp doesnt really balence uneven teams)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-03T02:11:14.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> if a laner builds it it won't do them any good anyway, so why bother disabling it?\n\nThen why bother not disabling it? You don't need to be killing the jungle creeps to have control of your jungle anyway though. Would you rather your top laner stop laning to make sure someone doesn't take your chickens? With proper warding, an enemy jungler walking into your jungle can be forced out or even killed anyway. The best solution is to keep everyone in their lanes so the lanes don't lose, and killing the enemy jungler if they dare to take your chicken.\nYOUR CHICKEN, not the enemy's chicken.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-12-02T03:26:37.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jungling items are now very specific to having Smite, if you don't have Smite they can be rather useless, or rather are useless.\n\nThey each give Smite new effects on use, and that is the main reason for buying them, and really the reason why you buy them. Having the items locked out from people who don't have Smite, prevents new or not so knowledgeable players from buying them and wasting their gold.\n\nUnless if you are a jungler, it doesn't effect you.","replies":[]}]}
