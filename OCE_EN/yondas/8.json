Teambuilder on OCE is an epic failure. Queue times can take upwards of 1 hour because no one wants to sit in a lobby for 30 minutes. Give us back Draft pick instead of this useless teambuilder crap, at least then we can play norms without seeing ekko and riven every game.\n\nOR\n\nGive us dominion.\n\nFor those newer players who do not know what draft pick is, its basically the same as ranked champ select. The only difference is that you dont actually gain or lose LP. So that means bans and pick order pretty much.\n\nEDIT: Imagine in the poll Teambuilder equals keep teambuilder and draft pick equals replace teambuilder since I sorta forgot about dominion being an option.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2015-06-24T17:56:51.206+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"teambuilder sucks a fat one.... y not have both? normal draft and dominion?","replies":[{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-06-24T22:35:52.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"now there is a idea","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-06-25T23:59:49.343+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"teambuilder is the optimal best option since it creates as perfect a team as you can get. the reason it takes so long is cos people dont play supp and/or adc. at least in blind pick/drafting people are forced (sometimes) to play a position they dont want to, and if they end up still going where they want, you've wasted a whole games worth of time and you've pretty much lost because of toxic duo mid laners or whatever","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-06-25T03:51:37.297+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or you could actually encourage people to play team builder and not have to put up with the crappy waiting times, just a thought.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-25T04:58:47.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes but then a circular problem remains.\n\nPeople don't play TB because any time they try the queue times are ridiculous.\nAnd because of this Queue times are ridiculous.\n\nIn theory it sounds good to just say everyone should go play it, in reality it's not going to work.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-06-24T14:26:51.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how about instead of normals draft picks, they bring back Dominion :D i think yes, but i agree 100% with team builder being garbage and should be replaced.","replies":[{"poster":"Yondas","date":"2015-06-24T14:35:22.635+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't mind dominion either.
