the documentation editor over at blue-eye macro.\n\nDo you know what that means? i am single handedly the person most trusted by the dev to know enough about his language to write the fucking documentation for it.\n\nIm no fucking script kiddie.\n\nNot to mention my 8 years of experience with c++\n\nAnd 3 years working with assembly code.\n\nSorry i should specify that by assembly i mean intel x86 op codes.\n\nPlease, sit your ass down.\n\nAlso by definition hacking is to \"gain unauthorized access to data in a system or computer.\"\n\nWhich in the case of a game hack, is to gain unauthorized access to the memory pointers of the game to be read or manipulated.\n\nScripting is by definition hacking.\n\nThe term scripting was coined as a script is a file, written is a custom language, designed to make coding for said purpose of the script easier and more efficient (the code isnt more efficient but thats not what i mean by efficient)\n\nYou could argue that scripting is easier than coding from scratch, and i would agree with you.\n\nBut autohotkey, autoit, lua, l#, they arent plain english languages, blue eye macro is, but blue eye macro is also extremely complex once you start looking under the hood, infact it being plain english is in my opinion a good thing, because it allows you to write down 20 thousand line scripts on paper, and 9/10 there wont be any syntax errors because its plain english, so you just remember what every command does, for instance variable.add(math)(\"\",\"\") is very clearly a function which adds a value to a numerical integer.\n\nBut rant about my favourite scripting language aside, scripting is just coding in a fancy wrapper.\n\nInfact all of the scripting languages i just mentioned do exactly the same thing, provide an abstraction layer between the user and a series of .net functions.\n\nThats it, thats all they do, they function identically to a code written natively in a .net framework, because every single last command in that script is a just a function call with input variables, and that function is written in whatever language the author chose to write their engine in, using a .net library.\n\nBar lua of course, it is its own language in its own right, but when used for scripting its usually piped through a parser that converts it into .net library commands.\n\n\nJust like how C++ is an abstraction layer for binary.\n\nAnd just as scripting is coding in a fancy wrapper.\n\nHacking, is just using a method to bypass a limitation, in a fancy wrapper.\n\nThats why hacking doesnt mean coding.\n\nFor instance, if i was to find out who you are, then find your accounts security question, then find out the answer to said question by observing you, and asking your friends, that is also a form of hacking, its called social engineering, or as i like to call it, human hacking.\n\nFor example L#, its very easy to tell how L# works, they have a set of memory pointers that they know controls certain commands or contain certain data.\n\nTake for example, fog of war hacks, there isnt some tricky shit going on there, L# is simply taking the information the client already has, cracking it open like a wallnut, and then showing you all the goodies inside.\n\nA simple fix for that, well not simple but a fix, would be for riot to change the way the server gives map information, namely just stop giving the location of every player in the game regardless of vision, that wouldnt last long as that would require a client side function to call certain pieces of information from the server, and anything client side can inturn be hacked and then controlled, but it would atleast deter them.\n\nBut like i said, if riot really wants to stop scripters, they need to lock down their memory addresses, blocking custom files, doesnt stop anything, as they dont need custom files to script.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2017-02-15T14:23:53.345+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"oh sweet sweet child\" \"im no fucking script kiddie\" \"please sit your ass
