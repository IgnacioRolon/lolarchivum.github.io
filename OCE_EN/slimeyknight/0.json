I truly feel like this dosen't deserve a ban at all. Infact the whole time the other person that i seemed to be getting into a argument with was zoe and althought I cant show you the logs she was saying some even worst stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"dogguyonline","date":"2020-01-22T22:58:17.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me its normal frustration flame \nWhat warranted it was probably the go next afk and too many F words\nalso the R word is auto ban \nAnother reason is even tho they show you on the report card the game that got you banned if you try contesting it they will bring up other ghost games where you were toxic as well to make it look like they were just mounting up evidence against you \nI think its more of a chat restriction rather than 14 days tho cause I've said way worse HAHAHA but who knows you probably said other taboo stuff you dont remember saying cause its all heat of the moment shit.\nbut yeah unlucky the riot moderators who run the justice system are people with no social skills who don't understand the psychopaths in this game  and or don't even play the game themselves :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2020-01-23T04:19:09.644+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Just troll the game you'll be fine. they dont care unless its chat log :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2020-01-23T01:55:38.463+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you want to appeal the punishment, you'll need to submit a ticket to [Support](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Discuss a personal suspension or restriction\" option). The support agent will review the case and determine if there's any cause for a reduction/removal, and if not be able to provide additional context where necessary/possible.\n\nGenerally, things like consistent negative attitude, giving up, spam, rank shaming, threatening to go AFK (surprise), and use of terms like \"retarded\", are behaviours that can contribute to a punishment. Ultimately, if you exhibit such behaviours in your games with any consistency that is probably going to push you towards triggering a punishment fairly quickly, but if I had to guess it would probably be the zero-tolerance language (use of \"retarded\") that's pushed this case over the edge. I'm inclined to think that Support will keep the ban in place, but no harm in submitting the appeal either.\n\nIn this case, it's triggered a permanent ban because that is the standard progression after a 14-day ban, which you have said you finished several days ago. The reform card for a 14-day ban states that the next punishment is a permanent ban, so it shouldn't be an unexpected progression.","replies":[]}]}
