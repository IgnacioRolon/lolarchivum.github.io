Just wondering if anyone knows when any of these game modes will be back out or even if they enjoyed playing them and would like to see them around again ?","replies":[{"poster":"TheyCallHimTeemo","date":"2017-11-21T22:34:06.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree. The fact that you can only play them for 8 days over the span of 2 weeks after 11AM each day, and then wait who knows how long till another one comes on awes me. Riot please cater to those who only play rotating game modes and ARAM....","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-21T22:31:05.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean, if your into the Rotating Game Mode, your just shit out of luck for anything good.\n\nRiot has got in the habit of doing the good ones once in a blue moon, and the shitty ones (Ascension being a major one) constantly.","replies":[]}]}
