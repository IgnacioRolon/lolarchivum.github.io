It's understandable, I think. Having to update a mode to work with the next patch *every* patch is a *lot* for teams to handle, especially when they could be improving the game in other ways (so long as Riot lets them), and I certainly agree that modes being available too frequently causes them to become boring. Featured modes are a unique and fun way to play, but only because they're not constantly available. Something like URF or Invasion (just for example) would become very boring very quickly if it were available all the time.","replies":[{"poster":"SuperHeavyWeight","date":"2018-05-16T19:09:53.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too much effort to put Ascension or Poro King in the patch ?
