The fact is, competitive play *should* be determined by the skill of a player, not their luck. With the innate randomness of the \"random pick\" mode that ARAM uses, skill is essentially thrown out the window in favour of luck. Either you get lucky with a champion and/or team composition that works, or you don't. Either way, there's often one team that just get's stomped.\n\nQuite frankly, I can't see a ranked ARAM queue getting enough attention from the player base to make it worth the effort to create and maintain, even on larger servers like NA.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2017-08-29T23:21:25.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wouldn't so much display skill, it would just be like a free-for-all on a ONE LANED map.\nSo bad idea tbh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-08-29T22:58:57.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah.","replies":[]}]}
