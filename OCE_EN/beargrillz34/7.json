Why is this???? I&#039;ve lost SO MUCH TIME because I got 0 EXP, I expect you guys to fix this asap!\n\nEach game was around 19+ mins as well so idk why","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2018-07-04T04:40:32.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does the total XP count change between games? Hopefully it’s just a visual glitch, but if it’s not, maybe we can work through figuring that out together as well.","replies":[{"poster":"BearGrillz34","date":"2018-07-04T05:08:20.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so Luckily I took 2 screenshots form 2 different games. \n\nIt says the exp was 0 in the game ending screen but in the match history it shows the exp I \"earned\". \n\nThese are 2 separate screenshots, 1 game after the other.\n\nhttps://puu.sh/AQf2W/ca7e004a33.png\n\nhttps://puu.sh/AQfI5/9ab1717fa2.png\n\nBut I never really checked to see if it added onto my actual exp. I can do the math afterwards to see if I subtract the exp I got from the currently played games gives me that value or not.\n\nEDIT: yep it was a visual glitch. Even though it said 0, I got the exp. It was weird though, not sure why it glitched on me. ","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2018-07-04T05:33:58.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the screenshots!
