I read the blog and it said it should be rewarded to you after 10mins. \n\nI didn&#039;t have ad block or anything like it. Can someone explain why I haven&#039;t gotten the reward yet?\n\nEDIT: Yes I was opted in and yes I was logged in & watched via the embedded stream.\n\nEDIT2: I just logged in and clicked the stream, it said \"You have watch rewards setup correctly\". I'll try it again and hopefully it'll work this time. \n\nEDIT3: Nope, still not there and I've watched about 12minutes worth.... What is going on....","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-10-02T03:47:27.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I can tell, it will only count towards the mission if you watch in fullscreen. I had a similar problem, tried having it open in a browser while playing on a second monitor, but it didn't trigger until the end of the match (only put it in fullscreen near the end of the match). Did it a second time with another account, put it in fullscreen straight away, and it triggered about 10 minutes in.","replies":[{"poster":"BearGrillz34","date":"2018-10-02T05:28:44.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing is, I already tried it 5 times using all possible methods.\n\nI even read the javascript code for it. \n\nThey send to their api the stream id and starttime (that you watched), it then sends a request every x seconds with the current time. After the currtime-starttime is > 10mins, the server will respond saying the mission is complete and will add it to your acc. \n\nI was monitoring the traffic and it was sending everything to the server. So I'm not sure why it says I haven't done it! I left it on for AAAAAAAAGES and still nothing.   I even used different web browsers for heavens sakes.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-10-02T07:00:37.715+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it's processing from the video stream properly, then it might be an issue with the mission itself (it might just be taking a while for the mission to trigger, too, as that happens occasionally). It might be a good idea to submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Worlds 2018 Event - question or issue\", since it's related to the worlds missions) and see if they can help resolve the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"BearGrillz34","date":"2018-10-04T13:56:52.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Already managed to complete it using firefox.

Perhaps it depends on mission traffic since you did it pretty much as soon as it was up and we did it a little later?\n\nIt's all a mystery :P","replies":[]}]}]}
