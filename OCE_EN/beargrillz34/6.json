I will update this post if we have/haven't gotten a full team to let all future readers of this post if we need anymore people. \n\nI'd like to say thank you for taking your time participating in this thread!\n\n\nEDIT2: You will receive an invite from \"UNFORTUANTELY\", he is our team captain and is handling the invites. Rest assured, this is the correct team I am in as well.\n\n~~So, ugh, well.... Shit happens and our players went MIA. I&#039;d still like to participate in clash but we are 3 short. I am expandable and so is my friend, we can play any role except for support (meme role). \n\nWe are playing for fun (obviously we are gonna try to win) but if we lose, it&#039;s alright, we had our fun.  So if anyone wants to join, please add me and msg me afterwards. \n\nWe are looking for sportsmanlike people who are friendly and aren&#039;t toxic. That&#039;s all we ask. No trollers, no inters and anything remotely close to griefing, please.~~","replies":[{"poster":"Elitest","date":"2018-06-05T07:17:26.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am top main if you are interested","replies":[]},{"poster":"Z6jiDtSUNl","date":"2018-06-05T06:29:12.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i play jg Z6jiDtSUNl","replies":[{"poster":"BearGrillz34","date":"2018-06-05T06:31:53.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think someone else already got jg, sorry.
