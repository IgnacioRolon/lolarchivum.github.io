I&#039;ve vsed a ton of scripters this patch ALONE. \r\n\r\nBackstory: For the past 3+ months of playing league (after I quit for a while) I had been enjoying the game. I would see like 1 scripter every 50 games. BUT, now it&#039;s just crazy. Almost every 2-3 games I see a scripter. Now you could say &quot;Na you&#039;re just bad&quot; or &quot;Na, they&#039;re just better than you&quot;. No, that is not correct.  \r\n\r\nThe game has packet delay, scripting removes that delay. This allows the players to do whatever they want with their movement in precise ms action. Have you ever seen a draven or vayne do some jagged dodge where they move out of the hitbox precisely? \r\n\r\nIf you  take a look at the dodging patterns between them and normal players, you will see that all scripters stutter like mad. So, I go and report them (all is well, right?). After weeks of checking, they are still unbanned and playing to this day. \r\n\r\nNow here&#039;s the problem: \r\n\r\nThis is an issue with OCE and ONLY OCE. I reported a few scripters from EUW and NA and they got banned within the week of the report (hmmm, I wonder why). I know OCE&#039;s player base is low but I don&#039;t think this is acceptable. If you banned all scripters over and over, day by day. They&#039;ll soon be forced to play legit because of all the accounts they&#039;re wasting. I&#039;m not saying that I only face scripters, they also are in my team.  It just gets really obvious after a while of observing. Ofcourse when I tell my team, they all say &quot;you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re talking about&quot; or &quot;He isn&#039;t scripting, he got hit by my skillshot just then&quot;. \r\n\r\nPLEASE, PLEASE be wary that scripts are 100% customizable. There are humanizers (which purposely gets hit by skillshots from time to time) and then there are % threshold conditions or &quot;Dodge only if in danger&quot; kind of stuff.  Have you ever played a game where u shit on a vayne or draven early when they&#039;re at 100% hp. But all of a sudden, when they&#039;re &lt;=50% hp, they instantly start dodging like gods.  You ask yourself, what could that be? How come he started dodging everything just then? I hate to break it to you, they script. If you look at the consistency, you&#039;ll be able to tell easily.\r\n\r\nNormal players can do some insane dodges, yes. But they aren&#039;t **consistent**. It&#039;s really easy to distinguish the difference between a legit player dodging and a script dodging for the player.  \r\n\r\nSo my question to you **Riot**: Will you ever do **** about it? \r\n\r\nI have gone to play champs which don&#039;t require skillshots anymore because of this. Just recently, I played twisted treeline with veigar and I vsed a scripter ahri. She stuttered so much, she died a lot. But then, when I do it to the other 2 people in her team, they get shit on. After looking at ahri&#039;s match history, I could see that she bought that account from someone. It&#039;s quite disappointing really.... Twisted treeline used to be so cool, now there&#039;s scripters everywhere.  Ranked solo used to be playable, now there&#039;s also scripters everywhere. I legit only see the scripters in the weekend. When I play during school hours, everyone plays LEGIT. I WONDER WHY?!?!!?!?!?   \r\n\r\n\r\nRiot, you have billions upon billions. You have already sued 2 of the biggest scripting platforms out there. Why not do it to the rest? Do what epic games did. GO look for some fortnite hacks, they are very, very rare to find (public ones) due to the nature of how strict epic is going against it. Just ban the accounts with no remorse, the second they are found scripting. I don&#039;t care if it reduces the population of the server. As long as we have a fair play, I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll be happy. \r\n\r\nWhat I had found was that Gold, Diamond (3-5) and silver 1-3 are the most common for scripting. For Bronze 1-5 and  plat 1-5  I had rarely seen anything.\r\n\r\n\r\nObviously I look frustrated because I am. I simply can&#039;t enjoy the game anymore, they&#039;re everywhere! I remember months back, I didn&#039;t have to worry about this at all. But now, this is all I worry about because whatever changes you made  to your AC system this patch, it surely created a ton more scripters.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-06-09T22:32:28.457+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once, me and several friends did a 3v3 in a _custom_ game, _(that awkward moment when you have 5 friends online at once)_.\n\nOne of the guys on the other team was really good at Zed.  So my friend _(on my team)_ picked Zed to annoy him, and for a joke used a _minor_ script that would help him look really good at Zed, just to tilt his friend.\nObviously no one reported him cos we were all friends, \n_(and no one even knew til way after anyway)_.\n\n2 weeks later. Perma banned.\n\nCustom game, no report, minor script.\nMy guess is that very very few scripters get past Riot's defences for long.\nSo I'm highly doubtful that ranked is _'unplayable'_ due to vast numbers of scripters. \nEspecially seeing millions of people play it daily with little issue. If anything, matchmaking is a far greater problem for most people, than any scripters.","replies":[{"poster":"BearGrillz34","date":"2018-06-10T05:32:50.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hmm, did he use public scripts?\n\nI'm not going to be racist here (or try to) but the Chinese players with those Chinese names mostly script. They must have some sort of private scripting platform. \n\nThat's pretty funny though, I'd assume your friend used scripts more than once tbh. Scripting once shouldn't get you banned (especially in a custom). \n\nThing is, I'm not really sure how many is many. Since you can easily tell the scripters apart from their dodges alone. It stutters too much to be real.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2018-06-09T12:22:48.920+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because if rito banned scripters, rito wouldnt really have a playerbase left.\nAnd despite how much they really deserve to go under lately, it wont happen over allowing scripters to script.","replies":[{"poster":"BearGrillz34","date":"2018-06-09T12:33:33.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you had read it all, I said that this would happen BUT it may force them to play properly(w/o scripts).
