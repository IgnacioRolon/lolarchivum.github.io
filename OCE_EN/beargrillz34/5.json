Yeah that's probably a bigger priority in life than a highschool exam.\nUndergraduate exams for a bachelors level topic? Eh, I'd probably say unless you're borderline failing, the highschool exam might have actually been more important.\n\nIf you're really trying to go for a competitive career, undergrad uni is probably the only break you'll be having before being an adult catches up to you. Trust me, the difference between undergrad and postgrad is like the difference between lemonade and coffee.\n\nPersonally I probably can't afford to play too much URF Lethality Poppy, and that's a real shame. I do hope Riot does give us an extension, though I doubt it, and I can accept the reasons they won't.\n\nBut don't shame the kid for asking.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-10-17T00:31:10.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Unfortunately, I doubt there's anything that can be done.\n\nThere's a few reason why Riot wouldn't be inclined to change times for this. As IVIemories said, the scheduled URF time is part of the 10th anniversary celebration, and it kicks off on the day that LoL originally went into open beta 10 years ago. It's also possible that they have things scheduled just after (or close to the end of) URF, and any delay with URF could then negatively affect their plans going forward.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that URF as a mode (\"classic\" URF in particular) is a bit notorious for causing large sums of players to actually leave the game, for various reasons, and Riot wouldn't want to risk losing too many players by extending the availability of the mode.\n\nThere's also the fact that OCE just isn't as popular of a region as others, and NA in particular. We've always been a bit of a \"niche\" region, and while I think the OCE Rioters do their best to have our region heard, it's just a bit impractical for Riot to change their plans solely(?) around us.\n\nIt's possible that Riot may consider an extension for the mode, depending on how this experiment of theirs goes, but the expectation (as far as I'm concerned) will be that this is the last time we'll have classic URF for a *long* time, and nothing is going to change the set time frame.\n\nPersonally, I'd love to see some consideration regarding this on Riot's part, but realistically there are too many factors that would make that too impractical, not enough of a pay-off for the effort and trouble it would take.","replies":[{"poster":"BearGrillz34","date":"2019-10-17T08:40:32.928+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It sucks how they don't allocate stuff based on time of region. \n\nAt least the NA team should have acknowledged exams around the world and allocated a more suitable time zone. \n\nThe only thing that concerns me is they'll start saying \"oh, but classic URF isn't as popular as ARURF, based on our statistics\" which may not even be the case. Due to the time frame it was given... At least if they enabled it for a full MONTH, then it may be better for everyone. It sucks that I'll be missing out on this.
