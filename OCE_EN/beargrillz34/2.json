I&#039;d really love to buy these champs, but cannot buy them on half price!! :(\n\n\nEDIT: Seems like they are 50% off via RP but not BE. You should state that it's for RP only, because that 50% champ bundle that happened 2 weeks ago was 50% off for both RP and BE... I got really excited here.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-02T11:26:00.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The norm for sales is RP only.
