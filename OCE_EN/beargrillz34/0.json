Our Malphite got autofilled yesterday as a support, but refused to help me. I didn't even do anything bad, other than said to the morde (who was also complaining) to report him and hope he gets banned for passive inting and griefing. \n\nOf course I'm going to open a support ticket to Riot about this. \n\nI'll give you the rundown.\n\nMalphite would just stand there and let me die and then blame me/not talk at all. Most of the time he'd walk up to the enemy and just walk around them, waiting for them to kill him. Then he'd blame me for not doing any work whatsoever. So then, near the end of the game I tell him to come with me and I initiate a fight. Guess what? He just stands there and let's me die. Doesn't ult, doesn't q doesn't do anything. \n\nAll of a sudden I get muted for whatever reason. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention everyone in the team had a disagreement with literally everyone else. I was not only talking to Malphite in these logs, but rather the **whole** team. These logs don't really show the full context.\n\nHere's the chatlog, I don't understand why they only show my logs. There is no context here at all, when you just see my logs. You will need to observe the full game with my chat, in order to understand the situation. Near the end, our mumu also AFK'd, it's why I told them to report him too. He literally gave up and said I'm gonna afk and so he did.... \n\nI don't really see the point in this report system if you're just going to automate it...

It was literally because I said \"report him\", I got a ban. \n\nHonestly the dumbest thing I've seen my whole life. \n\nBtw, those were all replies to my teammates, asking me this and that. Of course nobody cares about the context and goes for generic keywords. This is probably the reason why this game fails miserably at support. I myself feel like I just wanna feed now, just because of the lackluster response I got. It felt like it was a copy paste with a few human words in it lol...","replies":[{"poster":"Chopnblok","date":"2019-12-23T04:36:26.293+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeap. All text whether team only or all chat is logged. If you are going to report someone, make sure you are squeaky clean  because if they decide to report you back, then you may not be so lucky like this situation.\n\nI've disabled all chat in my client so even if I get in a mood and want to reply to someone, the game won't let me because it's disabled - but I can still listen to all the pings for communication etc.","replies":[{"poster":"BearGrillz34","date":"2019-12-23T18:12:16.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think you're understanding how stupid this system is. I know you and many others are ok with it, and nothing will change unless some big youtuber talks about it (like 99% of the big companies do). \n\nI can literally muck around and passively feed without saying a word, remaining unbanned. Whilst, I could go ahead and report people for swearing at me. I will remain unbanned, I will enjoy my freedom whilst the people who were raging at me will get a ban. \n\nThe response I get from support is automated and I'm still waiting for a reply from them.  I'm not going to bother arguing why this system sucks other than this because it is a complete waste of my time.","replies":[{"poster":"Chopnblok","date":"2019-12-23T22:12:08.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh I understand entirely.
