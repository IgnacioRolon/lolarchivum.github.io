Someone who is this toxic should not be allowed to play League. Hopefully we can get this sorted out quickly for you :)\n\nThese are the best steps to take in your scenario:\n\n1. **Do not get baited**\n He only added you because he wants a reaction. Completely ignore him, don't give it the slightest thought. The last thing we want is a flame war or for someone to go too far with some insults. \n\n2. **Block**\n If you haven't already, then block him. To do this just _right click_ on his name then select block from the dropdown menu, or find the _\"block list\"_ tab and add him to that. \n\n Doing this will stop him from ever re-adding you and talking to you ever again through the client.\n\n3. **Justice**\n Screenshot his harassment and send it over to Riot support [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). It's really important that we bring these people to justice. Too many of them do this and get away with it. Even if you don't have any screenshots, it's still best to let them know about it.\n\nI hope this helps a little, feel free to reply with any more questions!\n\n> _**As a side note:**_\n> I noticed you said _\"I was trying to send a ticket, but it seems unsuccessful\"_. What did you mean by that? **Riot Support** answers almost every ticket sent to them within a few days.","replies":[{"poster":"the raging blade","date":"2016-08-15T12:10:39.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-08-16T03:01:54.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to help you but I can't quite understand what you're saying. If you want a quality response from me I'd appreciate it if you do the following:\n\n1. **Make a new post** \nIt's really easy to loose track of stuff in the comments. I think it would be best for both of us if you made a new post [here](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/submit).\n\n2. **Try to use less abbreviations** \n It would be really helpful if you could simplify things for me, I'm really bad with abbreviations :D\n\n3. **Less insulting**\n It's not helping your argument at all. In fact, it's putting you at risk of being banned from the boards. I'd advise you to cut back a little bit.\n\nHopefully we can clear things up with you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Star","date":"2016-08-03T14:22:47.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I heard through some people that Riot have disabled reporting people manually (through tickets). \n\nOtherwise, those are some very valid points.

Although it really helps if you have screenshots and other evidence.\n\n\n+ In the case of in-game chat harassment, **Riot** would much rather players use the post-game report system. Going through support is really inefficient and costly.\n\n However, in the case that you forgot to report someone, they'll probably look into it for you. But you'll have to make it as easy as possible for them. (_e.g. supply game IDs, player names, screenshots... etc_)\n\nI hope that makes sense, thanks for replying :D","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-08-06T10:37:22.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Tele,\n\nI have a player who has been recently harassing me out of game (in Lol client).
