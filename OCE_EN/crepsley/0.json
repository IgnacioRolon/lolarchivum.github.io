It's like Riot constructed promos that you have to carry four other noobs to qualify, even if you are the support.

It's almost like win % changes the more you play, huh? Considering I haven't played ranked since preseason released, and considering I was climbing at the time, I'd consider my win rate higher, check my normals for a better understanding of my play.\n\nInterested to see where you're seeing my ward placement percentage. Because lately my games end before I can get more than 5 wards out. I generally save my wards for when I need them, as our support is blasting wards around to score vision, and I play top so wards are mostly anti-gank measures.\n\nBut, keep being a snarky bastard, I'm sure that'll get you out of bronze 3, with the exact same win rate as me :^)","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2015-11-27T09:33:14.993+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Considering normal games have no influence on your ranked standings, I will not look at, or consider them.\n\nI get your ward score from wardscore.loltools.net\n\nAnd yes I'm bronze 3. He difference though, is that I know I belong there. I'm don't think of myself as the messiah that plays at gold level despite having little impact on a game.\n\n\nOh and to touch on your wards again, even if every one of your games finishes at 20 minutes, I think that's a max of 30 wards you can have down with no wastage? Obviously that's over the top, but you see where I come from when I say that 5 is pretty poor","replies":[{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-11-28T07:50:30.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I belong in bronze because of my ranked statistics, but if I play better in normals, and have much better stats there, you don't consider that to be a significant factor to why I shouldn't be bronze 4?\n\nOkay then. Disregard the fact completely that I stomp people that are the same MMR or slightly higher than me in normals and consistently do well, and look only at my ranked statistics, even though clearly the majority of my league playtime has been in normal games. That's fine if you do that, but you're not being objective, you're being obtuse.\n\nI don't consider myself a gold level player. Congratulations in constructing a strawman and burning it, but that doesn't make you correct. I simply consider myself higher than bronze 4. Silver, at best, but bronze 1 is where I was 2-3 month ago and FOR 2-3 months, so I consider myself at that level.","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2015-11-28T09:36:36.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok stop talking about normals! Anyone can stomp normals. Normals is where people go to try out new champs or new builds or to dick around. It has ZERO relation to your ranked standings. Ever. None. Nothing.

MMR's getting shifted, friendly games lead to me not caring.\n\nOn a side note, most of my games have me with more kills than deaths. I take it you're ignoring the 17/3 illaoi game because she's a new champ, but what about the games with TF where I nearly go a solid 2.0 KDA, the game with ekko where I crushed in KDA and while we lost, I was carrying pretty hard up until the point where the enemy team could collapse on me.\n\nOf course, it's easy to say that you think I'm being carried. You're more than welcome to 1v1 me.\n\nNot sure why you're so mad though. I've proven multiple times that I legit play better than you think I do. I don't ward as much as I should, sure. Then again, I mostly hammer out top and/or adc/jungle games, and adc has a support to do the warding, jungle doesn't ward as much and at top I ward when I don't have vision of enemy movements. I'm smart enough with my map management to not need to ward as much as other people. Warding doesn't mean shit if you can't mechanically play the champ you're playing, and mechanical play is where I excel.","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2015-11-29T21:59:11.732+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now I'm even more convinced that you belong in bronze.\nYou talk about warding and skill as though you only need to cover yourself.\nThe support is not there to ward for the adc. The support is there to ward for the team. Top is not there to ward only for top. The whole team needs vision. Mechanical skill helps, sure. But the moment you stop looking after yourself, and instead look after the team (you know, those other 4 people in the game) you will start to climb.\n\nYour lane is warded but you've got a spare one in your pocket and a few spare moments of time?
