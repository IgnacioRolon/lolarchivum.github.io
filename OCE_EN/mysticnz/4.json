Currently we have **38 entries** and I have increased the max entries from **32 to 64**!\r\n\r\nThis is going to be a massive day!\r\n\r\nSome people have pointed out that I missed a rule on how you can win our 1v1 games, so here are the 3 ways.\r\n1.  Achieving first blood the opponent\r\n2.  Destroying your opponents FIRST middle turret\r\n3.
