The smurf I made was still stuck in North America. So then I thought the solution would be deleting League of Legends and reinstalling, because I got this cancer baby three years ago during my stay in the US. Maybe if I downloaded from Australia, it would offer a free transfer to the Oceanic server.\r\n\r\nWrong again. I bought my PC from America. American IP address, I thought.\r\n\r\nSo basically, if I install LoL on my grandma&#039;s laptop with an Australian IP address, will I be in the Oceanic server? And will I have to make a new account when I do? Or will it be fine if I log in with the smurf I made previously or even my main, all originating from the US?\r\n\r\nhalp pls","replies":[{"poster":"Human Ryze","date":"2016-07-01T04:22:39.535+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're not getting a free transfer.
