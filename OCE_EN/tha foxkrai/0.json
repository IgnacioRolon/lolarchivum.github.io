When you reconnect to a game without completely closing your client, the same game address is used to reconnect. If that *something* is blocking that specific address, then it would bring you to the black screen (or give you a firewall error, though it might not be occuring because the dialogue is not being triggered because *some* connections are actually still working). I'm thinking either a bad connection (though it wouldn't explain the consistency of it), a crappy ISP with misconfigured servers, malicious software on your computer or your bandwidth just being entirely used up at one point. If it's the last, then your client would get a ping of zero data (if even for the briefest of moments) and that could be causing it to choke up until it's re-established.\n\nJust a theory. I'm by no means a professional on networking.\n\nOh hey, have you tried disabling IPv6? That could be causing this.","replies":[{"poster":"Tha foxKrai","date":"2015-04-02T06:10:25.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll investigate your points further.
