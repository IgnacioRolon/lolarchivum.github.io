Only gives it a slight adjustment to the average (Silver 4).\n\nSo basically if you are Bronze 5, even if you go 10-0 in placements, expect to stay Bronze 5.\n\nAccording to op.gg, http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Basketballgeekz2+\n\neven though i hate using MMR Calculators because they are horseshit, you have low MMR even for a Bronze 5 person. So, if it were infinite you would probably be Bronze 7.\n\nYou do realise Challenger, Master and Diamond players can only place into Plat 1 and have to climb all the way back up. But you never see them moaning on the boards about unfair placements.\n\nPlay, Learn, Climb.","replies":[{"poster":"Wast3land ","date":"2016-12-09T08:38:23.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because they still play with the same people in challenger even in Plat 1 lol","replies":[{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-12-10T12:14:12.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know what i'd really love to see? Take one challenger player, say EGym (say roughly 2500 mmr) for example. Put them as support in a game where on his team he has four bronze players (say roughly 1000 mmr each). To balance out the matchmaking, the other team has five silver players (say roughly 1300 mmr each).\n\nWho would win the game? This scenario is probably never gonna happen, but who do you think would win the game? The supposed guy who should be carrying scrubs, or the other team? If EGym can't carry these games (as support btw, no other roles), how can a gold or even platinum player do so?\n\nIt is the epitome of what dynamic queue did last year to the whole matchmaking system. It will take a while to settle back to normal.\n\nThe mmr difference between two groups of players (one set at the bottom of the mmr ladder, and one set not at the bottom of the mmr ladder) is in no way linear or equal. This has already been discovered in games like chess, where if you think about the difference between a 500 rated and an 800 rated, compared to the difference between a 1900 rated and a 2200 rated.\n\nBetween the 500 rated and 800 rated, there is hardly any difference, despite the numerical value. Because these numbers are so close to the bottom of the elo ladder, it is mostly down to pure chance, luck, random mistakes that these players make.\n\nBetween the 1900 rated and the 2200 there is a huge difference in skill. Not just in understanding of the game, but also technique and application towards the game. And as you explore higher rating levels the skill difference is even more so. It is not linear by any means. The difference between the World Champion (2800) and an average Grandmaster (2500) is astronomical. \n\nTo give an example: \n\nIn 1998 (as part of the 50th anniversary celebrations of the State of Israel's independence), perhaps one of the highlights of the Russian chess world champion Garry Kasparov's career took place: He demolished the Israeli national chess squad 7-1 (a team averaging above 2600 Elo, including: Grandmasters Alterman, Smirin, Huzman and Sutovsky) in a clock simultaneous (playing them all at the same time, with the same amount of thinking time on his clock as each individual member had).  He scored 6 wins to none and conceded only 2 draws.\n\nSo in League of Legends if you take the equal average mmr of two teams, but one team has players that are mostly at the bottom of the ladder, or one team that has mostly players at the top of the ladder, the current matchmaking fails miserably. This creates the situation of the \"grind\". If you don't escape these nether realms of the ladder, you will not meet the skill level you desire, or the level that you can play the game for enjoyment of player's skill. \n\nIn chess it's much easier to escape the nether realms if you are a stronger player - you don't have to rely on anyone else to bring you down on your own team! In chess, there is no elo hell. There is only one person responsible for their show of skill in the game. If its at a too low level, they are rated accordingly.\n\nHowever in League of Legends (especially dynamic queue) I would say there is a form of elo hell, at the extreme bottom **and top** of the ladders. The hell for the bottom is some players being held down. The hell for the top is being paired against overrated retards that you smash silly and not only don't gain LP points for, but also the game feels like a waste of time. \n\nThe best way to avoid a \"grind\" or \"elo hell\" situation is to cut down on the people fabricating their mmr levels. This could be boosters, or dynamic queue itself, or simply the system making it possible for some players to fall into a skill bracket where they simply shouldn't be. Which is all very difficult to implement. At least in league they have a ranked decay system in place which is a good thing (in chess there are many boosted noobs that sit on their inflated elo that just beat up jackers to stay \"active\" i.e. avoid decay).\n\nAfter the debacle of dynamic queue last season, who knows what the cutoff regions are. So it's just better to let people settle down, before diving into games that may be in that region. Let the others sort themselves out firstly, especially on a server with such a small population, where perhaps only a certain amount of people would be playing at any given time of the day. Not a great sample size would be available to get fair matchmaking, especially now that there are two ranked queues active at the same time.\n\nTLDR; \"Fair\" matchmaking will not be happening for a while yet, thanks to the balls-ups of last year's Dynamic Queue.\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Basketballgeekz2","date":"2016-12-09T05:12:19.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thanks BarryButcher","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Montiness","date":"2016-12-10T13:23:26.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as your team aren't complete idoits though, you could end up with a game like this, where the support carries hard, because the team actually does things when they're told, and on great engages.

Even in losses if you're getting A+'s or S's you will be given a much better rank because of your consistency. But if you're getting C's and B's in your losses and barely A's in your wins, you will stay low. \n\nMay I ask what position you play? There are some basic tips for every role though.\n\nYou want to get as much CS as possible. If you play support, try to play a support champ, (AND DON'T CONTEST CS!) not Lux because you got the new skin. Lux and other champs that are usually a mid/top champ have their CS weighed against those roles, so unless you're doing ridiculous amounts of work and not dying, that CS differential will kill your rating on the champ, and place you as a lower class of player.\n\nWard. Even if you're not the support, ward, get control wards. Playing around this vision will help you not die and get picks.\n\nGold. You want kills, assists and high CS. Taking objectives. Towers and Baron help an insane amount so pay attention to wqhere you survive a 3 man gank and get kills, look where the rest of their team is, push the wave and maybe take tower before you back because you're low. It's a measured estimation.\n\nFinally your KDA. learn how not to die. If you can constanlty get a 3+ kda (kills and assists divided by deaths) your performance will improve aand you'll notice you'll start getting better teams (hopefully) and also better opponents.\n\nI learnt hese bits and pieces, got autofill roles and horrible games on them. I went 6-4 but because I followed these guidelines, I got my rank given to me 2 higher than the preseason placement.\n\nI hope that helps, GL!","replies":[]}]}
