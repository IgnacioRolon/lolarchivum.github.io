Most of the time they say \"i told you i only mid so dont complain,\" well that just doesnt cut it, it ruins the game for others trying to enjoy a nice game of league of legends and we need to have punishments for people like this.\n\ni would like to see a report button in the champ select screen and be able to report people for trolling, instalocking when lower pick order, flaming and any other options that people comment below.\n\ni believe by doing this it will make the game more enjoyable for the players of LOL and get rid of these people that only play one role.\n\n-ryann","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-27T23:23:26.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You seem to be missing one crucial factor: **Riot doesn't enforce the META**. \"Unfortunate\" but true.

This is to do with people instalocking or stealing called lanes. This kind of behavior SHOULD be punishable is basically what this post is saying, because the rest of the team suffers because someone decided everyone has to work around them. It promotes a poor attitude before the game even starts. People go in already annoyed and unwilling to cooperate.\n\nThe fact that this isn't the first time I've seen something along these lines posted tells me that people are sick of this kind of thing, both in standard and ranked, and Riot should come up with something.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-28T00:03:43.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> This has nothing to do with the meta. This is to do with people instalocking or stealing called lanes.\n\nExcept that **IS** to do with the META. The META is the player created portions of the game such as positions and pick/call order. It's up to the players, not Riot, to organise themselves in champion select with whatever tactics, it's not Riots fault that that happens to follow a generally accepted way of doing things (AKA the META) nor is it Riots responsibility to make sure players are organising themselves properly, particularly in regards to the META. Such behaviour SHOULD be punished but it's not enforced by Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Lonely Flame","date":"2015-03-28T00:52:41.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ignoring the thing about meta's completely (because that can result in a long discussion that's off topic), even by your own comment this idea is entirely on Riot and should/would be enforced by Riot.\n\nCurrently we have the report system. Riot created a system in which players could report people who were acting poorly. Players report unsportsmanlike conduct, and Riot's system punishes players appropriately, whether it be chat bans or a banning for a period of time.\n\nWe also have the leaverbuster system, where if a player either AFK's or leaves a que, they receive a short time penalty of not being able to join a game, and when that penalty is up they are placed in lower priority ques.\n\nOne is player based and one is automated.\n\nThis idea is essentially just a variation of the first one. You're saying it's on the players to organise themselves, but you have people who are intentionally being difficult and uncooperative, but then you're basically saying 'Well Riot shouldn't have to do anything. You have to deal with that person.' That promotes the wrong kind of behavior. You're telling these people they can instalock and steal lanes and that's okay because the team should be better organised and bend around the will of one person.\n\nBy creating a vote kick system, you could nip this kind of issue in the bud by getting rid of that kind of mentality BEFORE the game starts. And when I say that it is on Riot, I mean that it's on Riot to recognise that this is an issue they are not dealing with, create a system that can be used to address this issue, and then promote and enforce that system much in the way of the recent write up where Riot spoke about the current report system they have, how it works, and changes to come.\n\nThis is a player created issue that Riot needs to address because players currently can't address it themselves.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-28T01:11:57.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  but then you're basically saying 'Well Riot shouldn't have to do anything. You have to deal with that person.'\n\nThat's not what I'm saying at all, I'm only saying that Riot doesn't enforce the META. You'll notice I agreed with you when you said such behaviour should be punished. When the tribunal was around such behaviour was punished because the tribunal works on a basis of what the community accepts as appropriate behaviour and doesn't have to do with Riots rules but since the tribunal isn't around at the moment the META currently isn't enforced, by Riot or the community.","replies":[{"poster":"Lonely Flame","date":"2015-03-28T01:46:21.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But it's not just player accepted appropriateness. It's Riots rules that they have laid out in the Summoner's Code (http://gameinfo.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/) that everyone is going off. While these rules aren't as simple as \"Don't swear. Don't feed. Don't this. Don't that\",  if Riot didn't have an issue with a particular kind of behavior, there would be no option to report it eg If Riot didn't care that players were abusive/swore in game, they wouldn't go through the effort of putting in an option to report that kind of behavior. The option \n\nThis kind of behavior, instalocking and lane stealing, literally break Riot's own FIRST RULE of teamwork because out the gate you have people who are disruptive to the team and there is no way to respond against this unless either 1) Player 1 dodges and then THEY get punished (as opposed to Player 2 who created a situation that Player 1 thought the best response was to** not play the game**) or 2) everyone forces themselves to change pre-established stuff for one person.\n\nThe champs you and your team play and where you play them IS the META, not the manner in which that is established. The manner in which that is establish is a recognised code of conduct among players and part of player behavior. The META isn't to do with player behavior. You don't hear about a players behavior or attitude when a champ suddenly becomes a hot pick because they became more viable in the current trend of champ picks.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-28T07:55:14.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a point coming from the outside of this fight, the problem is that these people aren't just \"going against meta\" they are condemning your team and playing for themselves over the team, this has nothing to do with meta, they are deliberately fucking over your team.
