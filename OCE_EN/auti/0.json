Do you have a pc or a laptop? If you have a pc and know what you're doing I honestly want to say reseat your GPU, but I'd definitely recommend talking to Player Support. They are much more well versed in this stuff than I am, and if you don't know what you're doing you can damage components.\n\nIt seems very likely to me that there is some bad interaction with your GPU somewhere. There's a vague possibility it's antivirus related, so you could try turning that off, or it could be your computer trying to run games with the on board graphics unit (on the motherboard) and not the dedicated (if you have one, some laptops don't).\n\nThere is unfortunately a very wide array of things that could cause this, but the techies at player support can probably still help. Wouldn't hurt to contact Overwatch support either for the same reason, one agent might think of something the other has missed.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
