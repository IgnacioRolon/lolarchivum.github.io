Everything in between is a display of progress, stagnation, and diminishing statistics. By looking at past events, one can understand the contributing factors to success and failure.\n\nIf you claimed \"old players\" have left, and yet provided no statistic of HOW MANY in comparison to the whole; No one in their right mind can take you seriously. \n\nYou have no information of past and current.

It is a lie, that's not really up for debate.  The word _**\"Whole\"**_ was used. Therefore the statement is false, making it, a lie.  \n\n2. You say _**\"majority\"**_.  How do you know this?  Because of a few posts on a forum?  Your cause doesn't even have a majority on the boards, let alone the whole region.  Show me proof that the 'majority' of OCE league players support this.  If you're not making statistics up, it shouldn't be a problem.\n\n3. **_\"legitimate OCE players\"_** What makes someone a 'legitimate' OCE player?  Either they play on the OCE server or they don't.  If they do 'play' on 'OCE', by definition, that makes them an 'OCE player'.\n\n4. _**\"that go unpunished\"**_ Please show me proof that all these people 'running it down mid' don't get punished.  If they are doing this as often as claimed, and people are reporting them, I don't see why they wouldn't receive punishment the way all the rest of us do.\n\n5. _**\"immigrants into our country\"**_ Once again, proof please. But I'll pose the same question I did to OP, what do you want done about it?  Should people seeking a new life for themselves in another country be banned from playing league in that country?  I currently live in Japan, should I be banned from playing on the Japanese server because I'm not a national?\n\nPeople in this thread are happy to moan about their 'problem', but don't put forth any solution.  Perhaps that's because they know that any solution that appeases them, would be outright discriminatory, and unacceptable.
