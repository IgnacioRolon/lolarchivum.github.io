The problem is it only happens in LoL. HUGE lag spikes out of nowhere and they&#039;ve been a lot more frequent, the game is now unplayable. Finally after complaining enough, in game, someone mentioned &quot;packet loss&quot; right and the end, but they disconnected as soon as the game ended so I couldn&#039;t find out more there. Does anyone have any Ideas on why the ping test won&#039;t check my packet loss? I&#039;m a noob when it comes to the technical side of computers.\r\nSo far I&#039;ve reinstalled and updated Java (which was an initial problem) and that&#039;s about it, I&#039;ve tried researching for answers but it&#039;s just not working out. PLEASE any help is appreciated. I just wanna play league after a hard days work. {{item:3070}} \r\nThese are my ping test results - http://www.pingtest.net/result/123994459.png","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-29T09:07:02.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What ISP are you with?
