The issue I have is that not only do the competition rules not explicitly state that video format wasn't allowed, they go so far as to say this:\n\n_\"or any musical accompaniment** you do not have the right to use**: we don't want Gragas, Esq. writing us any cease and desist letters!\"_\n\nBy extension, this implies one can submit musical accompaniment that they DO have the right to use, such as something they composed themselves.\n\nI would further argue then, if my interpretation of that comment is a reasonable one, that it isn't unfair to other entries as many could have interpreted that as allowing music which, of course, cannot be included in an image file.\n\nCan you please verify whether or not my entry explicitly contravenes the rules before I submit an image solely? I understand that it was \"intended to be strictly a fanart contest accepting image files only\" but nowhere does it state that.\n\nP.s: It took substantial effort to compose the music as well so it would be extremely disappointing for it to be excluded.","replies":[{"poster":"Achenar","date":"2018-11-27T08:36:14.823+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're absolutely correct that the rules don't specify that video formats aren't allowed, and this is definitely an area in which we can be much more specific in future.

So a GIF for example is fine - however not an animation submitted in a video/flash/etc. format.
