There are unfortunately many entries to each contest that are stolen images (or joke entries, otherwise rule-breaking, etc.). We check each of these as they come in and then check them again when they're shortlisted for the panel's consideration. For this contest for example a full 50% of entries were invalid before the judging process even started.\n\nIn this case we performed the usual checks on all the shortlisted entries and nothing flagged for us, so we proceeded as usual. Unfortunately the piece we originally awarded first place was NOT an original piece created for this contest and our checks just didn't catch it. We're very grateful that the community did spot the issue, so that we can better recognise and reward the people who *did* create amazing pieces of original art.\n\nIn this case we've rolled the placements upwards - second is now a well-deserved first, third is now second, and the two entries that were tied for fourth are now taking home third place. \n\nA big congratulations to our dedicated and talented artist community - and a big apologies for not catching this one in the first place. \n\nAchenar","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darkness Rising","date":"2018-12-04T02:21:29.170+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not sure if that DJ zed is original.
