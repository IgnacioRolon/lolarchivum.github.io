What an astounding show of talent: from Ahh McKayn's amazing Illaoi rising from the waters to unleash an angry god, to the tranquil meditation of Karma by the water thanks to Stylus. That very cute Kled charging into battle from CrimsonCheez got me where it counts and a dreamy MF bobbing along the waters of Bilgewater by Wacalac is so calming to look at. You're all so damn talented, thanks for the amazing art!","replies":[]},{"poster":"AlphaChest","date":"2018-06-28T02:16:40.251+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"BOOOOOOO!!

There were a couple of entries that I believed should have been in the top 3 but each to there own. Biggest surprise to me really is the guy that got his artwork displayed on the league of legends oceanic client didn't make it to top 3. For such a large competition I just wanted to ask if the \"judges panel\" had artistic credibility, in hope that the artists that spent 3 months and didn't win, know that it wasn't from a \"panel\" of employees that put their hands up. Take this comment as you will, this is just my own personal thought.","replies":[{"poster":"yigga","date":"2018-06-28T12:27:29.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, from the competition briefing, it mentions that the panel includes riot team members here: \n\"Once all voting is complete, we will use the rankings for all three stages to collate a Top 10 shortlist.
