The ringing of the bells, already barely audible in the tent, receded until there was nothing but the trickle of liquid and an uneasy silence. \n\nThe man turned and set a cup down in front of the stranger. &ldquo;Drink this. Not quite Shuriman wine I&rsquo;m afraid, but it&rsquo;ll take the edge off the heat.&rdquo;\n\nTwo thin yet wiry hands emerged from under the stranger&rsquo;s robes as he raised the cup to his lips. Flecks of sand trickled down from his dirty hair and vanished into the sunlight that leaked between the gap of the tent folds.\n\nThe other man continued to stand and watch the visitor. Experienced eyes flickered from the stranger&rsquo;s face to his clothing, moving with systematic diligence and registering every detail before finally settling his gaze at the small dagger strapped to his hip. \n\nThe stranger set the empty cup back on the table. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said.\n\nThe man acknowledged the compliment with a smile devoid of any real warmth. &ldquo;You will always find hospitality among us- the desert is no friend to ours.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; the stranger said. &ldquo;We chose a difficult place to live in.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;We were not blessed with the luxury of choosing.&rdquo;\n\nThe sound of another bell rang faintly through the tent, and the two of them waited for the echoes to fade.\n\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recognise your robes,&rdquo; the man said. &ldquo;Where do you hail from?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Amakra.&rdquo; \n\n&ldquo;Never heard of it.&rdquo;\n\nThe stranger nodded. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have. It&rsquo;s a small settlement with a dying population, just north of Pakamader. I&rsquo;d recommend a visit, if it&rsquo;s still standing.&rdquo; \n\n&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;\n\nThere was a brief period of silence again.\n\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to be rude, but may I please have some more wine?&rdquo; the stranger asked, and his host moved to comply.\n\nThe tent itself felt simple. It was designed with cheap but stiff fabric, embroidered in the typical colours of faded gold and red. There were sand caked vessels of precious water stacked with painstaking care in the shade, a saddle designed for a Pha&rsquo;Laita camel hanging on a catch, a scimitar set in its scabbard leaning against a leg of the table. Nearly every item had a utilitarian use. Nearly.\n\nThe stranger lifted himself up off the chair and limped to a corner of the tent. He knelt down and scooped something off the sand.\n\n&ldquo;Your family?&rdquo; he asked.\n\nThe other man turned and looked first at the stranger, then at the scroll in his hand.\n\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful drawing,&rdquo; the stranger pressed. &ldquo;You have a lovely wife. And your child, your son&hellip;?&rdquo;\n\nThe man spoke after a short pause. &ldquo;Daughter.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Daughter,&rdquo; the stranger repeated the word, his mouth moving as gracelessly as if it was an unfamiliar concept. &ldquo;Do you treasure her?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Of course- I treasure all my family. And where is your wife and daughter now?&rdquo;\n\nBefore the man could answer the question, there was a sudden tremor that shook the ground beneath them. It was gentle enough to do nothing but displace small fragments of sand caught in the roof of the tent and swish the wine in angry vortexes around the cup. The man let in a sharp intake of breath and took a step backwards.\n\n&ldquo;What-&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;The shifting sands,&rdquo; the stranger said. &ldquo;Sometimes they have a tendency to do that, especially in ages like these.&rdquo; He looked up and gave a soft smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but may I have that wine cup please?&rdquo;\n\nThe man glowered at the stranger as his guest replaced the scroll and returned to his seat, dragging his right leg behind him with laborious difficulty. \n\n&ldquo;It must be difficult traversing the desert with that leg,&rdquo; he said, and the stranger waved off the comment.\n\n&ldquo;Yes, but yet we both found a way to survive here, no?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the man said. &ldquo;I lead an uninteresting life.&rdquo; \n\nThe stranger gave a smile that seemed almost patronising. &ldquo;Is that so? Because I sense quite the opposite.&rdquo; The stranger waited until the man placed the cup on the table. &ldquo;For instance, look at your bracelet.&rdquo; He suddenly leaned forward and grabbed the man&rsquo;s wrist with surprising strength.\n\nThere was another brief period of silence.  \n\n&ldquo;Let go,&rdquo; the man said quietly.\n\nThe stranger ignored him. &ldquo;Is it Shuriman?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;No it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;\t\n\n&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; The man jerked his hand free, his thick sleeves automatically folding back down to hide the bracelet from view.\n\nThe stranger fingered the wine cup. &ldquo;You are a clever man- that much is obvious. All I want is some intelligent conversation.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;I doubt I can offer what you want.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;But your bracelet tells me infinitely more than you ever could accomplish with words.&rdquo; The stranger let out a sigh. &ldquo;You have seen things that mankind should never have witnessed. What has happened, cannot be changed. So I ask you&hellip;will this be your legacy? Here you are, with your dirty sandals and cheap wine, in the middle of nowhere with fifty or more other nobodies, waiting for something to happen?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;I am content living here.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;No, maybe I got it wrong.&rdquo; The stranger frowned to himself. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not waiting for something to happen...Are you in fact, waiting for nothing to happen? Perhaps, your plan is to ignore history?&rdquo; \n\nAnother tremor shook the tent again, a little stronger than the last one. The man could hear more bells toll over the vibrations.\n\n&ldquo;You have overstayed your welcome,&rdquo; the man said, reaching for the scimitar near the table. \n\nThe stranger slowly nodded to himself. \n\n&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yes, I think so too.&rdquo; He pushed himself up off the chair and reached for his robe&rsquo;s hood before pausing. &ldquo;Your bracelet- it is a family heirloom, passed on from generation to generation, no? Do you miss your real home?&rdquo;\n\nAnother bell sounded through the tent, and the man snapped. \n\n&ldquo;There is no home!&rdquo; The man unsheathed his sword and lunged at the stranger. &ldquo;ICATHIA IS DEAD!&rdquo;\n\nThe stranger turned and looked at the man, and the man screamed. Where once there had been eyes, there was now nothing but an endless chasm of abysmal violet, swirling and alive, clawing at his body, his mind, his soul. The man dropped the sword and fell to his knees. He wanted to curl up and bawl, but the eyes wouldn&rsquo;t let him. They fixed him in place, and he could do nothing but stare fearfully into the infinite oblivion as it cascaded utter hopelessness and emptiness over every fibre of his being.\n\n&ldquo;DO YOU SEE NOW?&rdquo; the stranger roared. The man looked as he ascended up into the air, propelled by some unholy influence the man could scarcely begin to imagine. &ldquo;Can you see what I can see? Your fate was brought upon you by the hubris of your own kind- YOU ARE THE HARBINGERS OF YOUR OWN DEMISE!&rdquo; \n\nThe pressure of the stranger&rsquo;s profane energy pressed the man deeper into the sand as hundreds of distorted visions flashed through his mind. Visions of pain and suffering, then of brilliant colours and lights almost too fantastic to be reality&hellip;\n\nThen nothing. Somehow, it felt comforting. It felt right.\n\nThe man opened his eyes. The pressure had disappeared. The stranger hovered in mid-air before the man, the cripple in his right leg apparently forgotten. \n\n&ldquo;You cannot win,&rdquo; the stranger said. &ldquo;I know it. You know it.&rdquo;\n\nThe man laid slumped in the sand, defeated. There was nothing he could do, nothing to say.\n\nThe stranger drifted down back to the ground and knelt down beside him. &ldquo;Your wife and daughter&hellip;where are they now?&rdquo; he asked. A tinge of pity entered the stranger&rsquo;s voice, intermingled with what sounded like genuine sadness.\n\nFor a few seconds, the man spoke nothing. Then:\n\n&ldquo;They&rsquo;re gone,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Both gone. I buried them myself. Near the rubbles of Icathia.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;My most sincere condolences.&rdquo; The stranger bowed his head. &ldquo;You remind me of someone else. Another man- he shared your stubbornness. If only you had his strength&hellip;It saddens me that both of you don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;\n\nThe man could feel it now. Stronger and stronger tremors, shaking the sand from the rooftops, the sand from the pillar supports, the sand next to him.  And accompanying the tremors, came an unexpected noise. \n\nIt was the sound of scuttling, like the limbs of an incalculable number of creatures scampering over desert dunes and ridgelines.\n\nThe stranger knelt down and held the man&rsquo;s hand, almost as if he could sense his fear. \n\n&ldquo;Do not be afraid,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Embrace it, for it is the inevitable end that awaits us all.&rdquo;\n\nThe man closed his eyes. Somewhere outside, he could hear hundreds of bells toll frantically in the distance.","replies":[{"poster":"Zœ X Lulu Hentai","date":"2018-03-31T11:04:53.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is my favourite of the bunch.","replies":[]}]}
