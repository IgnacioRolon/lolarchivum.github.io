That&#039;s okay, Draven understands - other, less awesome people can&#039;t possibly hope to dress as smoothly as the Glorious Executioner (and they&#039;re just not as awesome). \r\n\r\nStill, everyone deserves a chance. Prove that your cosplay meets all Draven Day requirements, and Draven may reward you.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/0B2c1lK.jpg\r\n\r\nTo enter submit a photo of yourself [**HERE**](http://woobox.com/pn3dsp) in costume as your favourite champion, but with Draven&#039;s face.
