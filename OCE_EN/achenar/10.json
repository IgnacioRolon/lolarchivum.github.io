No matter how much something doused itself in the phosphorescent purple liquid that coursed through the arteries of every void creature or rolled around the course soil so rife with the beautiful scent of decay, there was always a miasma that differentiated it, that marked it. It was the difference between night and day, life and death. Though here, night and day were one and the same, a shared darkness, or rather an absence of light, while life and death shared a symbiotic relationship. Neither could survive without the other. \n\nThe only thing that mattered here was survival. Fight, survive, consume, repeat. \n\nThat was It&rsquo;s life. And It revelled in it. \n\nIt didn&rsquo;t matter that It was one of the smallest void creatures, or that It&rsquo;s claws were mere stumps compared to Kha&rsquo;Zix&rsquo;s. It would survive, It always did. \n\nThe same couldn&rsquo;t be said of the little girl who stumbled blindly into the cave. It watched with hungry eyes, predator&rsquo;s eyes, eyes that had adapted to see in the dark. She was small, as small as It was, and clad in only a tattered dress. It flicked out It&rsquo;s tongue and scented the sweet tinge of blood- human blood. \n\nIt tittered, suddenly impatient to sink It&rsquo;s mandibles into her supple looking flesh, and the girl&rsquo;s head snapped up. She was weak, stumbling in the strange gravity and shivering in the un-heat of the void. A small knife shook in her hand.\n\nIt rubbed It&rsquo;s legs together, and the girl whipped the knife up, swinging her body around in the dark to face it.- or where she thought it was. It waited till she had turned her back, and leapt for her, using the full power of small but muscular legs. She spun at the last moment, alerted by the tiniest rustle of wind, the smallest scrape of muscles as It pounced. Or maybe she sensed her life was about to come to an end. No matter. She was too late. \n\nThe scuffle lasted moments, and then It was on top her, It&rsquo;s mandibles dripping weakly acidic saliva onto her face. She tried to twist away, but It kept her pinned. Struggling was meaningless. She was as good as dead. The girl seemed to realise as well and went still, the only movement the rapid pounding of her heart, almost unbearably loud to It&rsquo;s ears. Almost. It lowered It&rsquo;s mandibles to finish her off. \n\nAnd stopped. \n\nFor a moment there, It felt a strange intimacy with this little human girl. Or maybe it was twisted familiarity. Like what It imagined the void would look like in the light- something It had known all It&rsquo;s life yet could not recognise. It realised what it was. \n\nHer unflinching determination, an unshakeable fearlessness that stared up at It, burning like the sun It had never seen. They were the same, it realised, and that thought made It hesitate. And with the hesitation came a slight relaxation. \n\nThat was all she needed. The little human girl, who&rsquo;d been completely at It&rsquo;s mercy, now yanked her arm from underneath one of It&rsquo;s legs and jabbed up. He didn&rsquo;t notice the knife till it was already buried in It&rsquo;s body. That tiny blade had been driven up, with a strength that contradicted the skin-and-bone structure of the girl, and had cleaved It&rsquo;s own pulsing heart. \n\nIt was dying, It realised distantly as It&rsquo;s blood gushed onto the girl in rivers. That was it. All that time fighting for survival, all those voidlings that it had consumed. All for nothing. Was this really as far as It could go?\n\nNo&hellip;\n\n It wasn&rsquo;t over. It would survive. \n\nUsing the last of It&rsquo;s waning strength, It lunged and bit into her flesh, feeling the bruised skin of her arm tear. She screamed, scrambling around as she tried to pry It off. She didn&rsquo;t notice the crevasse behind her, neither did It. Not till the ground disappeared beneath them. They fell, and everything went black.\n\n***\n\nIt opened It&rsquo;s eyes. \n\nNo. That wasn&rsquo;t right. \n\nIt&rsquo;s eyes opened. But it hadn&rsquo;t opened them. It sat up and froze. It&rsquo;s whole body had changed. Two small legs and arms- a humanoid shape. Was it It&rsquo;s body? It felt It&rsquo;s neck crane to look at It&rsquo;s body- the body that wasn&rsquo;t It&rsquo;s true body- and a sudden fear crashed through It. No&hellip; It wasn&rsquo;t It&rsquo;s fear. It was someone else&rsquo;s fear. As if It were merely watching from the outside. It&rsquo;s head moved again as the body raised It&rsquo;s arms, then examined It&rsquo;s legs. The fear was now a coursing river. And suddenly, for the first time, It felt true fear. \n\nWhat was happening to it?\n\n&ldquo;No&hellip;&rdquo; A weak voice moaned. &ldquo;No no no no.&rdquo; \n\nIt took a second to realise it was It&rsquo;s own voice. \n\nIt&rsquo;s body moved of It&rsquo;s own accord, scrambling across the rocky floor till it was kneeling above a dank pool of void water, It&rsquo;s arms braced on either side of the small pool. It&rsquo;s eyes scanned the abomination reflected before it under a dim light that had no source. \n\nIt was the face of the little girl, but just below it, roiling around her neck, her collarbone, was a mass of purple flesh, glowing faintly. \n\nWell that explained the light. \n\nA memory assaulted It suddenly, mere flashes of a fight; three monsters- voidlings- leaping at It, and then It raised It&rsquo;s arms- the girl raised her arms- and purple energy burst out of her hand- a hand coated in dull purple, It&rsquo;s flesh. \n\nIt remembered It&rsquo;s lasts moments. It&rsquo;s refusal to die. \n\nBut It had died anyway. The thing it had become in It&rsquo;s desperation...\n\nIt growled in frustration and the girl snapped her head up. It paused in surprise. Had she heard it? \n\n&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; She said, her voice a lone whisper within the overbearing silence. \n\nIt growled again. She spun around.  \n\nIt roared in anger this time. The girl yelped and stared at her hands, because suddenly, inexplicably, magenta lines now glowed like veins crossing over the delicate bone structure of her once fragile hands. \n\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you&hellip;&rdquo; She said slowly as she raised her arms in wonder. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in my head&hellip;&rdquo;   \n\nSo that was it. That was what It had become. It hadn&rsquo;t died, but rather, it had fused with her- two organisms becoming one. \n\nA symbiotic relationship. \n\nA pang of hunger suddenly jabbed at it, accompanied by a growl from her- their- stomach. The fear returned, and it took a moment for It to identify it&rsquo;s source. \n\nThe girl didn&rsquo;t know where to find food. \n\nShe didn&rsquo;t realise that here, in the Void, everything was food. Another flash of memory- the voidlings that had attacked her- them-, falling, smoking and dead, to the floor. \n\nIt growled, sending images of the voidlings, and It&rsquo;s hunger, to her. If It could understand her words, then surely she could understand It&rsquo;s language- the Void&rsquo;s language.\n\n&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, and he was assaulted by a sense of her revulsion. \n\nIt pushed back, sending wave after wave of sensory imagery; the delicious and filling taste of voidling flesh, the trickle of sweet blood down It&rsquo;s throat. \n\nSurely this girl would understand. \n\nShe didn&rsquo;t. Instead she grabbed her sides and threw up into the pool. She didn&rsquo;t have much to throw up though, only bile. \n\nIt clicked in displeasure. This time it sent images of death, flash memories of the still and silent bodies of void creatures that had starved. \n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a void creature.&rdquo; She shouted while gagging. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; \n\nThe two fought then. Not a physical battle, but rather a contest of wills, the girl&rsquo;s humanity, against It&rsquo;s survival instinct.\n\nAnd finally, when they could barely move, and hunger was all they knew, the girl gave in. \n\nThey crawled- their legs were too weak- to where the carcasses of three voidlings lay, their legs rolled against their thoraxes. They picked one up- it was small, no bigger than a sand hawk (what was a sand hawk? It wondered) and bit into the soft flesh of its underbelly. \n\nBlood flowed into their mouth, bringing with it taste. But something was different, the taste no longer the same. It was horrible, It realised as they almost threw up again. \n\nBut there was nothing else to eat, so morsel by morsel, they forced it down. It was either eat or starve.\n\nAnd with each bite, a new image flashed between them;\n\nThe loving touch of a father&rsquo;s hand.\n\nThe first kill.\n\nThe warmth of the sun.\n\nPrimordial rage.\n\nAnd among it all, a single name. \n\nHer name&hellip; no&hellip; it was their name now.\n\nKai&rsquo;Sa... \n\nFor the first time, they were in harmony.\n\nThey would survive. And beyond that&hellip; they would return to their home, to the world above. Because it was It&rsquo;s home now as well. \n\nThey were one.","replies":[{"poster":"Sheren","date":"2018-04-01T09:34:30.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, everyone who read my story.

But it hadn’t opened them.\"\n\nWhen you think about it though, when taking about its eyes, it should definitely be 'its.' Nobody says \"Wim opened Wim's eyes.\" It would be \"Wim opened his eyes\" or \"their eyes\" which is why I think 'its' should just be used as the possessive rather than making it overly complex and unclear. Sure, you're right, it's a stylistic choice, I just think it's definitely the wrong one and (for me at least) makes it difficult to get into the story.","replies":[{"poster":"Sheren","date":"2018-04-01T09:29:10.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand that the use of \"It\" and \"It's\" is a bit confusing, but the character has no set gender and no set name as I said in my reply to Seras Dragon. Because of that I could not use \"He\", \"She\", \"His\" or \"Hers\" and as such the only viable option to maintain integrity (though I did mess up a tiny bit) was to use \"It\" and \"It's\". Also if you find it difficult to read along with it, everytime you say \"It\" with a capital \"I\" just put a lot of emphasis on it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-31T10:05:52.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't mean it was a stylistic choice, I just meant of all grammar rules, the fact that 'it's' isn't possessive despite all other possessives following that 's rule is one that people aren't likely to know. Using it's for possessive feels weird because \"it is\" but using its for possessive (which is the correct as far as I know) feels weird because all other possessives have the apostrophe.\n\nIt's an easy mistake to make, especially if you've never seen it in context (which is entirely possible).","replies":[{"poster":"Sheren","date":"2018-04-01T09:24:50.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"It\" is used purposely as the character has no gender nor name (though somewhere in there I used \"he\" by accident).
