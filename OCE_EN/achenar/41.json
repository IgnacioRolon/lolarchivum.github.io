It bloated inward as though assaulted by an insurmountable pressure, torn papers and books dancing around inside, carried unnaturally by the wild void energies bursting from its center. There lay a book, pages flipping wildly as veins of alien flesh stretched forth, pulsating, and spewing a stinking haze. It smelt like rotting flesh.\n\n\tAbove the book it floated, what could only be described as grotesque. Ooze leaked from a mouth with no jaw, trailing down a body of bone wrapped in a runed canvas that glowed with ancient power. Its heavy paunch folded over a loincloth, bright yellow eyes leering down at the small yordle before it. \n\n&ldquo;No fear?&rdquo; the voice gurgled with surprise, &ldquo;Does my visage not terrify?&rdquo;\n\nIt gestured to its body, skin swinging loose and sallow about its elbows. The yordle looked up from the floor where he lay wheezing, slowly rising up against a nearby wall. \n\nVeigar struggled to speak, &ldquo;Maybe the weak, with their feeble minds, are scared, of such&hellip; ugliness. I only fear the unknown, and I know you.&rdquo;\n\nThe void creature tensed, perturbed, &ldquo;Oh, you do, pitiful yordle? Do not confuse your knowledge with understanding. You have no idea what I am capable of.&rdquo;\n\n\tIt snapped its fingers and void energy crackled. Power arced forth, striking the yordle&rsquo;s palm, needles of purple light easing neatly into his flesh, bringing rise to a sudden well of blood before&hellip; Nothing. The yordle&rsquo;s eyes slid down, staring into a perfect hole carved through his hand. He scoffed.\n\n&ldquo;You were a fool for summoning me,&rdquo; the creature said condescendingly, &ldquo;Feign strength as long as it pleases you, but it won&rsquo;t matter much longer. Soon I will dismantle your body, leaving ever piece to rot in The Void, and when nothing is left-&ldquo;\n\n&ldquo;You will eat my soul,&rdquo; Veigar bore his teeth, glaring, &ldquo;On with it creature, I don&rsquo;t have all day.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;You will have an eternity,&rdquo; it spat, stepping forward, &ldquo;And I will take great pleasure in visiting you myself!&rdquo;\n\n\tSnakes of purple energy struck at the yordle, his hands now little more than fingers attached to a void. Tendrils of flesh crept closer across the wooden floorboards, and the void creature followed in their wake. The air tasted of rotting fish, and the yordle gagged.\n\nThe creature grinned, &ldquo;Having trouble breathing? Maybe I will take your lungs next, reach down your throat and plant a void worm, and let it eat you from the inside out. I do love watching your kind squirm, drowning in their own filth.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;How needlessly cruel,&rdquo; the yordle nodded, &ldquo;Even for a void demon.&rdquo;\n\nThe creature smirked, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis only the beginning for you, my little plaything. So many things set aside in my torturer&rsquo;s toolkit. Unspeakable things.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Unspeakable things,&rdquo; Veigar began, &ldquo;From one of the unspeakables.&rdquo;\n\nThe creature paused. The shapeless void-flesh crawled further, reaching greedily for the yordle&rsquo;s legs, purple energy running up and down arms that were no longer present.\n\n&ldquo;Unspeakables?&rdquo; the creature said cautiously, &ldquo;What do you speak of?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;I told you, I know you. I&rsquo;ve heard your family whispers for years,&rdquo; Veigar croaked, &ldquo;You of the Da&rsquo;Sha.&rdquo;\n\n\tHands closed around Veigar&rsquo;s throat as the creature leapt through space, instantly closing the gap.\n\n_&ldquo;Where did you hear that name!&rdquo;_ it hissed.\n\nThe yordle cough and spluttered, eyes bright with choked laughter, &ldquo;From&hellip; you! They locked, me away for years, years upon, years until I&rsquo;d thought every thought and had nothing, left. And then I heard you, your brothers, sisters. Voices from The Void call to me, and they&rsquo;ve revealed you.&rdquo;\n\n\tThey tendrils around his legs were growing. They struggled like leeches, desperately sucking at his legs, keening with shrill delight as their food warped and collapsed. Veigar clenched his fists.\n\nThe hands loosened, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve gone mad.&rdquo;\n\nThe laughter died, &ldquo;Is it mad to know these things? Perhaps. It seems insane to think of the power you and your kind wield, how many countries you possess, how many people you control.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;We control nothing yet,&rdquo; the figure spoke softly, &ldquo;But soon we will escape The Void, reach through the rapture, and burn your puny world to the ground.&rdquo;\n\nVeigar sighed, &ldquo;You expect me to believe that? It&rsquo;s nothing but a lie, that you need a physical presence to take what you wish.&rdquo;\n\nThe creature cocked its head with animal curiosity. It dropped to the yordle&rsquo;s level, finger waving lazily through the air as purple energy teased along Veigar&rsquo;s neck.\n\n\t &ldquo;How much do you know?&rdquo;\n\nVeigar stared upward into space, &ldquo;Too much. Much too much for a mortal mind, and yet someone must know, know why you created The Rupture.&rdquo;\n\nThe creature scoffed, &ldquo;Me? Create The Rupture? That is a great feat of magic, far beyond what I can muster.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Not by yourself,&rdquo; the yordle said wistfully, &ldquo;It took all of the Da&rsquo;Sha to open the way, but you were the architect of it all, Ortus.&rdquo;\n\nThe void-flesh reached further, leaving the withered leg husks in their wake. These limbs hung stiff and dead as purple energy swirled upward from the feet, sending everything to The Void.\n\nThe creature was still as stone, &ldquo;Why did you summon me?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;To destroy you, of course,&rdquo; the yordle said matter-of-factly, &ldquo;There would be no point in closing the way if you existed to rebuild it.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;You thought you could kill me?&rdquo; the creature frowned, &ldquo;I am sorry to say that you have as much chance of ending me as you do closing my portal. And to what ends? You&rsquo;ve mentioned yourself that it is of no consequence, that we need no physical form. I&rsquo;ll admit that much to be true.&rdquo;\n\nVeigar smiled, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need a physical form, but you do need The Rupture. I&rsquo;ve studied you and your kind for years, trying desperately to understand what The Void wants from this world. I quickly learned of the ancient void creatures deep beneath the earth, and it didn&rsquo;t take much to realize that they were not asleep.&rdquo;\n\nThe creature chuckled, &ldquo;Oh, clever! Yes. My masters may be trapped, but their powers are not. From the depths they reach out and take the minds of your most trusted compatriots. You are but playthings to us.&rdquo;\n\nVeigar nodded, &ldquo;And that begs the question, why the Rupture? If you have complete control from the depths, why risk the sun to fight us in our realm?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;It is a mere generosity,&rdquo; the creature shrugged, &ldquo;The most juvenile and beastly of us prefer to have their fun in physical form.&rdquo;\n\nVeigar&rsquo;s legs were gone, the void energies now chewing at his body. It would be only a matter of moments before he disappeared into The Void. The creature before him licked its teeth in anticipation.\n\n&ldquo;I came to the same conclusion,&rdquo; the yordle said knowingly, &ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t quite fit, does it? You don&rsquo;t care for each other. If it weren&rsquo;t for Runeterra you would have destroyed yourselves millennia ago, driven by your own desire for violence, power, destruction. No, the Rupture isn&rsquo;t just a portal. It is a pathway to channel your masters&rsquo; influence.&rdquo;\n\nThe creature snarled, and then composed itself, &ldquo;That means nothing. Even if you somehow eluded me here you would never have the capacity to destroy my creation, to use what you know. Its construction is perfect, and you mortal races are weak. You have not the magic to do anything.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;The crux of the problem,&rdquo; the yordle said, &ldquo;and why I changed my mind about killing you.&rdquo;\n\nThe creature looked bewildered, &ldquo;Your delusions have taken you. You think to escape, without killing me? Perhaps banishment is the trick up your sleeve?&rdquo; \n\n&ldquo;No, not banishment.&rdquo;\n\n\tThe room began to keen. The air was violent around them as the void energies dispersed, its tendrils burned away. The yordle&rsquo;s body rose into the air, nothing left but his chest and blinded skull. \n\nThe creature leapt toward him, howling, &ldquo;What is this! What are you doing!&rdquo;\n\nThe yordle screeched, not with words but with magic.\n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;M GOING TO SWALLOW YOUR SOUL!&rdquo;\n\n\tHorror dawned on the creature and he fled, but it was too late. The yordle gathered all the energy he could muster and used it to tear apart his own soul, feeding his magic with his life as the power engulfed Ortus, pulling it apart, consuming it. Beneath the energies you could hear it screaming, painfully, magic burning it alive as it was stolen. Quickly there was silence.\n\n\tThe room exploded. Shards of wood burst outward, books and pages burning up. The sun was suddenly beating down on the yordle, his body sheathed in magic as he rose to steel feet, hands clinking with dangerous spikes, body hidden by a purple hat and robe. In his hand emerged a staff, power radiating from it and perfecting his new form.\n\n\tBeneath the hat glowed a pair of bright yellow eyes, and Veigar gave in to endless, maniacal laughter. The magic had called to him, and he had taken it.","replies":[{"poster":"Maaron","date":"2018-04-09T09:27:39.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great story.
