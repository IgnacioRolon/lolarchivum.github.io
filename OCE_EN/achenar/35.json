There seems to be a deceptive serenity that hangs on the rays of sunshine that peek through the cracks in the obelisk like monument.\n\nA figure walks up to the monument placing a hand on its crumbling stone. It is Malzahar the prophet of the void, his hood and cloak dirtied from an arduous journey.\n\nHe looks up to the sky and breathes in the sunshine before taking a step back from the monument and producing a book from within the folds of his robes. He flips through looking for a specific page and once he finds it he begins to chant.\n\n_MALZAHAR\n(repeating)\ncom&rsquo;efo rth&rsquo;eat ero&rsquo;fwo rld&rsquo;maw..._\n\nHe recites an ancient incantation and at first nothing seems to be happening, but as he repeats the incantation his eyes\nstart to fill with the essence of the void, swirling, dark purple.\n\nThe ground begins to crack dark purple tendrils emerge, spiraling from beneath the prophet, hypnotically and rhythmically pulsing with every alien syllable of the spell, enveloping and merging with the obelisk, filling the gaps between the stone with the essence of the void. When it is whole again the darkness starts to seep into the sky, shadows feasting on daylight itself.\n\nPurple clouds begin to form in the sky, getting darker and heavier. They swirl and twist spreading far beyond the limits of the ruined city and across the sky of Runeterra.\n\n**EXT. JUNGLE - DAY**\nTeemo, cleaning his blow dart gun, looks up to the sky. Through the trees he watches as the daylight is swallowed up by an unnatural darkness. He slings his dart gun over his back and with a solemn expression vanishes into the dense jungle.\n\n**INT.DEMACIAN PALACE - DAY**\nJarvan IV looks over the city of Demacia as his people scurry in terror, clambering to get into their homes. As he stares through the glass and into the void itself, Garen appears over his shoulder.\n\nJarvan nods, unable to shift his gave from the horrors before him, Garen in turn bows his head and strides out of the throne room.\n\n**EXT. BILGEWATER - DAY**\nThe darkness extends to sea where the Dead Pool is being tossed about by the seas desperately trying to escape the all consuming void.\n\n**EXT. THE DEAD POOL DECK - DAY**\nThe pirate crew frantically try and hoist sails and secure the rolling cannons on deck. Their captain Gangplank simply sits on a barrel that doesn&rsquo;t budge in the storm - more scared of Gangplank than the crashing waves - he is simply peeling an orange with a mad grin on his face.\n\n**EXT.ICATHIAN MONUMENT - DAY**\nMalzahar is now swallowed whole by the power of the void, it is all around him, infused in his core and spilling out from every pore.\nThe clouds in the sky part to reveal a doorway into the void itself, a portal from which Malzahar intends to pull unspeakable horrors into Runeterra.\n\nSuddenly the rolling clouds enjoy a tranquil stillness. There is a crack of black lightning and the clouds move at the speed of sound, receding into the portal, no longer covering up the beautifully sunny day. The clouds collapse into the doorway like a star imploding on itself and the door begins to close. Before it does a black comet plummets to the ground, colliding with the monument just as the\nportal closes.\n\nA huge dust cloud obscures from view exactly what it is that Malzahar has summoned, he decides that it would be best to go and investigate it for himself.\n\nAs Malzahar approaches, the dust clears revealing a dark mass, smoking from the impact. It rises and falls with a gentle breath, sleeping soundly despite being in a smoldering crater.\n\nMalzahar is confused.\n\n_MALZAHAR\nHuh..._\n\nMalzahar picks up a rock. He tosses it at the creature.\n\nThe creatures eyes spring open. It leaps onto its hind legs, resembling a kind of alien caterpillar-dog-kangaroo hybrid, its stubby tail wags and gobs of green goop drip from its mouth, forming a sizzling, caustic puddle.\n\nIt sits on its rear and lifts its leg to scratch its ear.\n\n_MALZAHAR\nCreature, do you know why you&rsquo;re here?_\n\nThe thing is distracted by a butterfly.\n\n_MALZAHAR (CONT.)\nI summoned you here to this plane so that you would bring this world to ruin._\n\nThe butterfly lands on the creatures nose and it goes cross eyed.\n\n_MALZAHAR (CONT.)\nDo you possess sentience? Do you possess ears?_\n\nMalzahar slumps down, dejected as the creature starts to roll in the dirt.\n\n_MALZAHAR (CONT.)\nI don&rsquo;t understand, the second sight ordained that this summoning ritual, at this platform, at his time of day would bring forth the\ndevourer Kog&rsquo;Maw. Instead I bring forth a slobbering imbecile._\n\nKog&rsquo;Maw notices that Malzahar is feeling blue.\n\nKog&rsquo;Maw goes over to Malzahar and slumps down next to him, looking up at the sorcerer with ginormous eyes.\n\n_MALZAHAR (CONT.)\nWhat do you want?_\n\n_KOG&rsquo;MAW\nHUNGRY!_\n\nMalzahar grins, a bubbly upbeat tune starts to play, it&rsquo;sanime montage time.\n\n\n**EXT. A FIELD - DAY**\nKog&rsquo;Maw runs gleefully through the flowers, stretches his body all the way back and chomps down on the flower.\n\nMalzahar cheers.\n\n**EXT. A BEACH - DAY**\nKog&rsquo;maw splashes into the waves, dunks his head and slurps up a fish tail that is the same length as him.\n\nMalzahar puts his hands to his cheeks in awe.\n\n**INT. BANDLE CITY WORKSHOP**\nHeimerdinger is working on a new Hextech suit for Rumble, a shiny chrome model.\n\nHeimerdinger reaches into his draws, to look for a tool to work on the contraption behind him. Malzahar and Kog&rsquo;Maw sneak into the garage. Kog&rsquo;Maw quietly slides his mouth over the gadget and drops it into his stomach.\n\nThey sneak away supressing giggles. Heimerdinger is so confused when he turns to see his precious invention has vanished.\n\n**EXT. A FOREST - DAY**\nKog&rsquo;Maw hops along the forest path and stops, revving like a chainsaw. He jumps, unlocking his jaw and stretches it over the top of the tree which disapears inside of him, defying all possible explanation.\n\nMalazahar faints melodramatically, Kog&rsquo;Maw catches him and points a handheld electric fan at the recovering Malzahar which lights up and spells: VOID BOIS.\n\n**EXT. MOUNT TARGON**\nSilence. Wind whips snow on the peak of the mountain.\n\nMalzahar and Kog&rsquo;Maw stand at the peak of Mount Targon, looking out whistfully at the setting sun. Kog&rsquo;Maw sits and uses his back leg to scratch the side of his head.\n\n_MALZAHAR\n(Utmost seriousness)\nThis is it Kog. Your final feast.\nBy nightfall the whole world will be one with the void. It will be just as the prophecy fortold..._\n\nKog&rsquo;Maw is looking up at Malzahar with big round eyes, glistening in the fading dusk.\n\n_MALZAHAR (CONT.)\nDon&rsquo;t give me that look. You knew our time was short, you need to fulfill your purpose and there is no need to waste time..._\n\nKog&rsquo;Maw looks deep into Malzahars soul, searching for a possibility.\n\n_MALZAHAR (CONT.)\n(Turning away)\nGoodbye Kog and goodbye Runeterra._\n\nKog&rsquo;Maw widens his stance and prepares for the biggest feast of his life. He stretches back, winding up for the big munch but stops, he remembers what his life was like before Malzahar and how much fun they had together. He glances over at Malzahar, shuts his eyes and moves in for the world ending nom.\n\n_CLOSE UP: MALZAHARS FACE_\n\nA single tear rolls down Malzahars cheek.\n\n_MALZAHAR\nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWW!_\n\nKog&rsquo;Maw has wrapped his mouth around Malzahars leg, consuming it up to the knee. Malzahar lifts his leg and tries to shake off Kog&rsquo;Maw but he is careless and they trip and fall off the peak of Mount Targon.\n\nThey bounce down the mountain, Kog&rsquo;Maw, grinning though his mouth is still full with Malzahars leg. Malzahar, straining through extreme agony, his leg dissolving from the caustic slobber, his bones shattering from the fall and yet, when he looks at the creature of the void - a creature just like himself - none of that seems to matter.","replies":[{"poster":"AvK Ðęlµxe ąƒ","date":"2018-03-30T09:04:27.141+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"TOMATOMETER: 91% - Certified Fresh.\nAverage Rating: 7.5/10\nReviews Counted: 115\nFresh: 105\nRotten: 10\nCritics Consensus: The Devourer (or, Kog'Maw Wants More) hits its coming-of-void beats more deftly than many entries in this niche genre -- and represents an overdue, if not entirely successful, milestone of darkness.\n\nAUDIENCE SCORE: 92% [liked it]\nAverage Rating: 4.5/5\nUser Ratings: 3,322","replies":[{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2018-04-01T03:07:23.791+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: 7/10 mediocre \ntoo much kog'maw","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xLullaby","date":"2018-03-31T01:49:01.596+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"koggo is a good doggo","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShellMellow","date":"2018-03-30T05:52:58.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hot damn this is amazing, this needs to made into a cinematic {{sticker:sg-lux}}","replies":[]}]}
