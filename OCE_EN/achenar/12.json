Its menacing forests stood tall before them, the undergrowth thick and rampant, having gone unchecked since Noxus&rsquo; invasion.\n\nThe journey used to take him two days if he pushed himself. But much has changed since those days. Now, he doesn&rsquo;t even need to touch the ground.\n\n_**CONGRATULATE YOURSELF ALL YOU WANT. TRUE STRENGTH IS MEASURED IN CORPSES, NOT HOW FAST YOU CAN RUN.**_\n\nHis destination was one of the Order&rsquo;s outposts. This hideout was hidden deep within the verdant forest, tucked away in a natural cave, shrouded from sight by the dense canopy.\n\n_**ARE YOU TRULY SO RIDDLED WITH DOUBTS THAT YOU COME HERE, DESPITE YOUR MASTERS WISHES?**_\n\nOpting to stay hidden, Kayn called in the surrounding shadows, cloaking himself until he was barely a silhouette. Nobody had come to meet him yet; that was all the confirmation that he needed. Hefting the blade of Millennia onto his shoulder, he jumped, ascending easily towards the upper branches.\n\n&lsquo;If I were truly filled with doubt, I would have remained with the Order, slaughtering the Lhotlan upstarts. This is confidence.&rsquo;\n\nAs he leapt silently from branch to branch towards the entrance, Kayn felt the scythe writhe in his hand. He felt his skin begin to crawl with a familiar bloodlust.\n\n_**LOOK AT YOU, CHASING GHOSTS AND FOLLOWING WHISPERS. YOU WASTE YOUR POTENTIAL. BETTER TO HUNT LIVES AND CAUSE SCREAMS!**_\n\n&lsquo;I do not need your commentary. A good tool remains silent while the master works.&rsquo;\n\n_**YOU ARE A MASTER OF NOTHING BUT SMOKE AND MIRRORS, BOY.**_\n\nHe bit off a retort to the scythe as he closed on the Cave&rsquo;s entrance. A hush laid over the forest, the nearby trees having turned lifeless and grey, the smell of rot heavy on the air as the forest wilted around the Cave. Descending from the canopy, he landed silently where the Outpost&rsquo;s entrance should have been.\n\nIt had been obliterated; the hideout having disappeared without a trace. In its place; deep cracks which stuck far into the earth, alien tendrils flowed out like roots, burrowing into the surrounding stonework, an unsettling purple glow which permeated the shadows around it.\n\nThe scene l and from the depths, a sinister light permeated the shadows. As he examined his surroundings, he readied his scythe.\n\n&lsquo;Looks like we won&rsquo;t go unsated after all.&rsquo;\n\nEven a novice of the Order should have at least left some sign of a struggle. Even the foliage was undisturbed.\n\n&lsquo;It&#039;s too perfect&rsquo;\n\n_**READY YOURSELF. SOMETHING APPROACHES.**_\n\nThe red eye on the scythe cracked open, bloodshot iris focusing on something moving in the undergrowth. Kayn begun to hear the stomp of many heavy feet, and he realized the scythe was trembling.\n\n&lsquo;I am always ready.&rsquo;\n\nThe sounds were coming closer and closer, bashing their way through the dying bushes with no care for stealth. Stepping into a tree as easily as one might step into an open doorway, Kayn withdrew from sight, readying himself for his chance to strike.\n\n_**OHHH. I WOULD RECOGNIZE THIS SCENT ANYWHERE.**_\n\nRhaast&rsquo;s trembling increased, and Kayn realised he felt none of the usual bloodlust from Rhaast.\n\n&lsquo;What comes? Noxians? Your Brothers?&rsquo;\n\n_**SOMETHING FAR WORSE.**_\n\nKayn felt his chest tightened as he realized that for the first time since he&rsquo;d picked up the scythe, Rhaast was afraid. What being was so terrible that it could cause a Darkin to fear?\n\nThe rumbling grew deafening, and Kayn began to lose control of himself, fear gripping his mind. Emerging from the undergrowth came a swarm of creatures, thundering hooves flailing, ghastly cries echoing through the forest.\n\n_**WORAX. I HATE WORAX!**_\n\nEach beast, barely larger than a cow, stampeded across the Cave&rsquo;s entrance, erasing any useful traces Kayn might have been able to find into dust.\n\n&lsquo;Cattle? You&rsquo;re afraid of cattle?&rsquo;\n\n_**THOSE THINGS ARE DISGUSTING. A BLIGHT UPON THIS WRETCHED REALM.**_\n\nKayn sagged out of the tree, the tension in the air being replaced with feelings of shame and second-hand embarrassment.\n\nRhaast, the Blade of Millennia, the reaper of thousands of battles, levelled his gaze at Kayn, the crimson stare unblinking.\n\n_**WHEN I OWN THE SHADOWS. THEY WILL BE THE FIRST VICTIMS OF MY WRATH.**_\n\nThe Worax&#039;s charge continued out of sight, filling the forest with pandemonium as countless woodland creatures fled into the night.\n\n&lsquo;You&rsquo;re lucky that they were so loud Rhaast, otherwise they would have heard your terrified screaming and attacked.&rsquo;\n\n_**BE THANKFUL THAT NO ONE WAS AROUND TO WITNESS YOUR PANIC, BOY. SEEMS YOU&rsquo;RE NOT SO FEARLESS AFTER ALL.**_\n\nDropping back down to the ruined floor, Kayn made his way to what was left of the obliterated hideout.\n\n&lsquo;What use is a terrified harvest tool? Tell me why shouldn&rsquo;t I just throw you down forever into this tomb?&rsquo;\n\nRhaast didn&rsquo;t get a chance to respond before the monstrosity attacked.\n\n***\n\nBy the time he was able to pinpoint the creature&rsquo;s position, it had already loosened its third volley, bony spikes whistling through the air. Kayn was a blur, slashing through the air as he tried to deflect each one. Two snuck past his guard, piercing his flesh. He felt numbness spreading through his body, and he realised his movements were hindered as he brought up Rhaast to deflect.\n\nCatching a glimpse of movement skittering around the base of the forest, Kayn brought the Blade of Millennia up, barely deflecting the lethal volley aimed for his skull. He felt stabs of pain from the wounds, and he realized that his speed was slowing.\n\n_**I AM NO SHIELD KAYN. MOVE BEFORE YOU DOOM US BOTH.**_\n\nReaping through the air in a desperate dive, Kayn escaped into the undergrowth, two more spikes rocketing into his spine. As he begun cloaking himself in the nearby shadows, the creature seemed to follow him with its eyes, prowling high branches above him.\n\nThe spikes kept lancing towards his position as he escaped through the trees, flung by the creature&rsquo;s whipping barbed tail. It gripped the ground with all fours as it threw spike after a spike, and a long prehensile tongue tasted the air, following Kayn&rsquo;s movements precisely. More and more of his strength was sapped with each successful hit, an easy target for any skilled predator.\n\n&lsquo;There&rsquo;s no escaping it seems&rsquo;\n\n_**THEN STOP RUNNING.**_\n\n***\n\nFeed. Feed. Feed. Feed. Hungry. Oh&rsquo;maen repeated to itself, thick rolls of drool sliding down its warped tongue. New host. New host. MAGIC!\n\nIt watched its prey with all the patience it could muster, watching as the warrior darted between foliage and trees. It could smell the shadow magic, taste it on the air, tracking the little creature by the moving currents of mana. It hungered for the little creature, salivating at the thought of possessing the body and eating the screaming mind within. The food here was so rich, so delicious! It was all the vanguard of the Void could do to sit still and wait for a clear shot.\n\n***\n\nKayn could see the monster, lurking on a branch of a tree. He stepped out, spreading his hands wide, inviting a shot to the chest that would surely be fatal. The monster was wary, but Kayn kept stepping closer and closer, closing that crucial distance.\n\nThree more steps...\n\nThe monster raised its tail to strike, barbed spikes menacingly rattling in its tail.\n\nTwo more steps...\n\nThe creature&rsquo;s eyes narrowed as it hissed and arched its spine, beginning to whip its tail forward.\n\nOne more step&hellip;\n\nIt lashed out a volley of spikes, hurtling through the air where Kayn had been standing but a moment before. But Kayn wasn&rsquo;t there anymore.\n\nUsing the Creature&rsquo;s own shadow as a gateway, he dodged directly into the creature, diving inside the very essence of the being&rsquo;s mind and shattering it in his grip with his most powerful shadow magic. From his position within, he felt its body go limp, its spirit being shattered. Bursting from the creature&rsquo;s remains, Kayn finished the kill, slicing its throat with a fading strike for good measure. With a small flourish of Rhaast, he spun through the air before ending, standing easily on a nearby tree branch.\n\n&lsquo;A clean kill.&rsquo;\n\nRhaast did not answer.\n\n***\n\nOh&rsquo;maen felt the thrill of triumph as its warrior came into contact with his host. With just a thought, it followed the stream, slithering the little creature&rsquo;s unprotected mind. It could see it, glimmering in the darkness, soft, wet, juicy, delicious. It was only as it began slithering towards the mind that it became aware of something else in the space, an apparition of something dangerous, something wrong.\n\nIt tried to re-enter its canine host, trying to escape this trap, to return to the hive below. As it struggled, it became aware of the great, red set of encircling jaws that surronded itself and the little mind. The last noise the little creature heard was a deep, rumbling chuckling that trailed off into a low growl.\n\n_**THIS ONE&rsquo;S MINE.**_","replies":[{"poster":"Wim Tinton","date":"2018-04-06T04:18:23.970+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I enjoyed this story a lot. The interactions between Kayn and Rhaast were interesting and evocative.\n\nJust a few pieces of advice.\n\nBe careful with your use of semicolons. A lot of them are unneeded. For example:\n\n> It had been obliterated; the hideout having disappeared without a trace.\n\nThe word 'having' makes the second clause dependent. This means the semicolon doesn't make sense/is unneeded. 'Having' should be 'had' instead, and even then, splitting it into two separate, simple sentences might be more effective. eg:\n\n> It had been obliterated. The hideout had disappeared without a trace.\n\nAlthough, if you want to stick a semicolon between those two sentences, that would work too.\n\nAlso:\n\n>  In its place; deep cracks which stuck far into the earth, alien tendrils flowed out like roots, burrowing into the surrounding stonework, an unsettling purple glow which permeated the shadows around it.\n\nthis sentence is a bit of a mess. If you read the clauses before and after the semicolon, neither of them make sense on their own. Why not just have:\n\n> In its place were deep cracks which stuck far into the earth. Alien tendrils flowed out like roots, burrowing into... etc.\n\nEven though 'stuck far' could use be rephrased to use language that's more evocative, do you see how much better the second version is? You have all the components, just a tiny reshuffle makes a huge difference. I have fallen into this trap before: semicolons are not your friend!\n\nFeel free to ignore this as much as you want. At the end of the day, you're the writer and this piece was a very enjoyable read.\n\nBest,\n\nWim :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"mellon collie","date":"2018-03-31T07:37:40.660+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What a cool story.
