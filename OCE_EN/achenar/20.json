You can check out all of the entries in [**this gallery**](http://woobox.com/arw96c) - but we&#039;re excited to announce the winners! All winning cosplayers will receive accommodation and flights to Melbourne, as well as tickets to PAX Australia on the 27th-29th October.\r\n\r\nThe panel selected the winning entries based on three criteria: accuracy and attention to detail, craftsmanship and the quality of construction, and ability to embody the champion&#039;s personality and mannerisms.\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re attending PAX Australia, you&#039;ll be able to see the winning cosplayers throughout the weekend. There will be a photo meetup at 1PM each day where you can meet these cosplayers (other League cosplayers are totally welcome!) and grab photos, so come check it out - more details to come!\r\n\r\nWithout further ado, here are our winners!\r\n\r\nRock Lobstar\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/YXudqGr.jpg\r\n\r\nSkyhuntress\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/RWZMuCN.jpg\r\n\r\nNguran Cosplay\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/qoU2gx8.jpg\r\n\r\nJajutsu\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Ja4AdfP.jpg\r\n\r\nElyxir\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/0bpgfdv.jpg\r\n\r\nPhunkee Bones\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/toFBPEI.jpg\r\n\r\nButtchampion\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/JwtJRDX.png\r\n\r\nPikapi\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/906u6zP.jpg\r\n\r\nCass\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/RrblB7Q.jpg\r\n\r\nFloksylocksy\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/nLWGSNA.jpg\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/PytpigE.jpg\r\n\r\nChoccy\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/JKmXhj5.jpg\r\n\r\nPythoness\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ZXrZJCM.jpg\r\n\r\nMercat\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/S5sEPzz.jpg\r\n\r\nAlishiera\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/bnbbCpx.jpg\r\n\r\nCatRoulette\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/m3omWX3.jpg\r\n\r\nTokidoki Blokey\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/3LTV7XQ.jpg\r\n\r\nMaryBear\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/HThnTkU.jpg\r\n\r\nAshleigh Priest\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/sEDtoUm.jpg\r\n\r\nZaphy\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/2ZVq61N.jpg\r\n\r\nlBetal\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/7mWqRLU.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nWe&#039;d also like to give a shoutout to the following honourable mentions - cosplayers who we want to recognise for their creativity and commitment to levelling up their craft.
