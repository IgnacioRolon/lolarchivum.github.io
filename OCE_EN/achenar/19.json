Do you, like, not want to show the other servers how awesome we are or something? It's the same deal with our esports scene. You're completely keeping it underground. Like, Korea and sh*t aren't part of Riot games yet they still make it onto the LoL Esports schedule and news web pages.\n\nEDIT: For the record, this is something that legitimately infuriates me. You claim there's no vested interest in the OCE scene but then the Esports team never even tries to get NA and EUW viewers. Seriously - get our Pro scene onto the Official LoL Esports Youtube channel because right now channels like EpicSkillShot are reaping all of the benefits BECAUSE NOBODY OVERSEAS EVEN KNOWS RIOT GAMES OCE HAS A YOUTUBE CHANNEL.","replies":[]}]}
