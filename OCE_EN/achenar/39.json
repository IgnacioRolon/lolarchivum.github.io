So the way this works is that the final results are based on your cumulative total results from the three contests.\n\nSo for example:\n* if you come in the top 10 for all three contests - you're looking pretty good!\n* if you come in the top 10 for one or two contests, and in the top 50 for the rest - still definitely possible, because others will be the same\n* if you only enter one of the three contests, but you get 1st place in that one - you're unlikely to end up with a top spot because you're competing against artists who entered in all three - but it's still technically possible, depending on how others have done.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CrimsonSeal","date":"2018-05-28T11:30:47.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OH HELL YEAH!!!","replies":[{"poster":"SpiritFox60","date":"2018-06-07T23:38:36.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You sound so excited! {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} \nWOOOOOOOOOOO","replies":[{"poster":"CrimsonSeal","date":"2018-06-09T13:36:37.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SpiritFox60,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=M16TJoeA,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-06-07T23:38:36.061+0000)\n>\n> You sound so excited! {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} \n> WOOOOOOOOOOO\n\nI am going full throttle on this one. >:)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"9Shinigami9","date":"2018-06-08T00:15:45.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Windrenz","date":"2018-06-06T12:17:38.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i didnt enter the past two rounds.
