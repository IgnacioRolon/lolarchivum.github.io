If it's not locked down to hard private, havent checked in a good 6-9months, probably been made public again by Zuckerberg\n\n\nAnd as for Rural, i can think of a couple of easier shots you can think of also, not just adapting an outfit to being more mobile, unless the entire outfit is photoshopped, in which case, you've got a ground zero project ahead :P \n\ni can think of 3 awesome photo's you could do as a nami in rural areas still, some travel may be required, but nothing too major that the basic car couldn't cope with i'd imagine. \n\nJust need one decent water source / waterhole / large enough pond and a willingness for 1 of the photos, to get the outfit partially wet, as you'd be submerged breaching the surface, you can dump a good 1/3rd of the outfit for the picture, still tasteful, still sexy without busting your bits out for attention :)\n\nWould help if you know a decent make up artist also for the face / scales, but even then, you can buy \"scales\" to temporarily glue on your cheek bone lines easily and remove them after. \n\nedit 2; just remembered, im a very blunt person, just making it clear its in no way meant to be taken as a negative but as positive constructive criticism, you've all done effort i would never be that bothered with to spend time, money etc, most i'd do is a morph suit.....
