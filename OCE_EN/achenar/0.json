Now, when using the term \"champion\" does that explicitly mean only characters that are playable in-game, or can significant characters from the lore (such as Keiran or Boram Darkwill [mentioned in Alistar's lore] or Akunir and/or Coll [mentioned in Xayah and Rakan's stories]) be used instead? I have an idea of something I'd like to do, but need this clarification so I actually know what I'm doing.","replies":[{"poster":"Achenar","date":"2018-03-06T03:28:20.603+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Heartvine! This question has popped up a couple of times so I've just made a quick update to the ruleset, so it now says 'must feature at least one League of Legends character' instead of 'champion'. Hopefully that gives you the flexibility you need!\n\nUltimately this rule is in place so that everyone creates stories that are clearly set in the League of Legends universe - eg. I can't write a piece of Final Fantasy VIII fanfiction and then namedrop the Void to make it count! Strong entries for these contests usually have clear ties to Runeterra or one of the alternate universes like Star Guardians, and would be clearly recognisable as League-related to the average player.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-03-06T05:24:35.876+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds great!

Cutting someone's arm off is fine, but maybe if you're getting really _really_ gory and visceral about the way you describe the blood and bone shards and whatever, you're getting a little closer to the line.
