If music is your passion and creating music via MIDI is your thing then you should absolutely keep at it. Your submission was valid, but unfortunately didn't make the finalist cut. \n\nMusicality was one of the factors in picking the finalists and, being a MIDI track, it had to really knock it out of the park to take a spot.\nThe cover was very focused on the base chord progression rather than the melody. The soft-harp style as the main instrument over the constant drum beat was tough to get lost in and it became slightly repetitive. It was sitting somewhere between electro-pop and orchestral - going forward I'd look at hammering down the tone of your piece and supporting your melody to make it fuller.\n\nThanks for entering, hope this feedback helps you build out more music in the future!","replies":[{"poster":"Curio","date":"2018-07-30T11:49:48.817+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does, thanks!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Asurine","date":"2018-07-30T06:13:54.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dam not much people did it dam","replies":[{"poster":"fdstreetking","date":"2018-07-30T06:49:53.491+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"It might look like that, but this actually just a shortlist for all of the participants.
