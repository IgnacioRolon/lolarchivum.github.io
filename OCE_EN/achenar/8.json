Congratulations to all the winners.**\n\n\nWith almost two hundred entries, our writing community came out in force to respond to the Touch of the Void writing prompt. We&#039;ve been diving deep into all the amazing stories you shared with us, overwhelmed by your creativity and passion. Some of you chose to share tales of loved champions delving deep into lost Shuriman cities; others wrote poetry and prophecies telling of the end times. Others, well - some of you *really* like Vel&#039;koz.\n\nWe&#039;re pleased to be able to share our finalists list. This wasn&#039;t an easy decision with so many fantastic pieces, but this list of our favourites hopefully gives you all a taste of the breadth and originality of submissions.\n\nTake a look, and make sure to vote for your favourite piece below!
