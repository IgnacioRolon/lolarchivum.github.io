I wanted to give a little extra context about this contest, because it's something new that we're trying out and some of you might be wondering - why not just run three separate contests?\n\nOne of the things we'd love to see in OCE is more opportunities for passionate players to turn their talents into something sustainable. Our partnership with Wacom has given us a chance to share tools to help you elevate your craft, but we wanted to create something that had a 'big bang' impact. By combining three competitions into one mega marathon, we're able to offer larger, more substantial prizes – such as an Artists' Alley booth or a Cintiq – which provide a huge opportunity for artists to potentially turn their hobby into something more.\n\nAs I mentioned - this is something new we're trying, so please let me know if you love it, hate it, etc.!","replies":[{"poster":"Pazzz","date":"2018-06-09T12:23:14.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great idea guys.
