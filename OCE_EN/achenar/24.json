Most notable is the fable Gift of the Aspects&rsquo;, scribed in a curious blend of Ancient Freljordian and Ionian runes.\n________________________________________\n**I: Stars**\n\nIn the beginning, there was Darkness. \n\nThen first speck of light appeared. He is the creator of life; we know him as Aurelion Sol.\n\nFirst, the Star Forger hatched a new world. The stars bent to his desires, coming together to make the earth. The light gathered to become the sun, its shadow the moon. \n\nHe named this young planet &lsquo;Runeterra&rsquo;.\n________________________________________\n**II: Storms**\n\nWhen his creation was done, he willed into existence the guardians of that realm: aspects of the silver city. (1)\n\nBut the aspects harboured envy in their hearts. They desired each other&rsquo;s domains, for what use is an incomplete fragment? And thus, a storm began to stir. His name is Volibear he is the demigod of storms and conflict. (2)\n\n_(1) Ancient Runeterrans believed that the summit of the world rested upon Mount Targon. They call it the silver city._\n\n_(2) Demigods appear to be manifestations of the aspects&rsquo; desires._\n________________________________________\n**III: Fire**\n\nVolibear ravaged the earth with lightning and thunder. The moon turned crimson with his rage. The continents shook, splitting apart beneath the storm&rsquo;s fury.\n\nAurelion Sol witnessed this destruction and, he, too, was overwhelmed with fiery anger. Mountains rose and the world boiled. Beneath the lava a new demigod awoke. His name is Ornn and his is the art of forging and creation. \n\nBalance was born. \n\nThus, the envy in the aspects subsided. Lightning died as Volibear retreated back into his own domain. Aurelion Sol returned to the stars, content.\n________________________________________\n**IV: Life**\n\nThe earth changed in seasons between Volibear&rsquo;s wrath and Ornn&rsquo;s warmth. Life began to flourish and in the following age, the first humans appeared upon Mount Targon.\n\nThe Aspects of Mount Targon granted them seven gifts:\n\n**Healing** and **Warring**. You will know love and hatred.\nThe **Sun**, the **Moon** and **Twilight**. You will know the passage of life. \n**Inspiration**. You will know curiosity.\nAnd finally, the **Protector**. You will know that you are not alone. (3)\n\nThey ventured as far as the Freljord where Ornn rests. There, humanity learnt the reason for forging.\n\n_(3) The gifts may have been inspired by several figures in Runeterran history: Soraka, Pantheon, Leona, Diana, Zoe, Ezreal and Taric. These individuals must be later incarnations of the original aspects._\n________________________________________\n**Interlude: A Promise**\n\nIn the following millennia, they forged homes and hearths; friendships and grudges; and last of all, much to the chagrin of one aspect, iron weapons.\n\nThe people warred against each other in earnest, fueled by greed. Their furious conviction birthed the twin spirits of death. Kindred arose in moonlight and shadows; all who live will one day die by Lamb&rsquo;s arrows or Wolf&rsquo;s fangs. (4)\n\nThe Aspect of the Sun, a warrior whose name is now lost in the sands of time (5), saw how one tribe would do no harm. **Inspiration** overtook her senses.\n\nShe descended down in her mortal form and asked the tribe: &ldquo;Why do you not join your brethren?&rdquo;\n\nThe tribe replied: &ldquo;The world bears fruit upon branches that are too high and in numbers that are too little. We do not need to war over them &ndash; we only need to assist each other in picking them and plant their plentiful seeds.&rdquo;\n\nThe sun warrior, impressed, promised them: &ldquo;You will not die meaninglessly. I am the Aspect of the Sun and Life. Hide under this bridge tonight and I swear to you: you will meet us in the afterlife only after you reach a ripe, old age.&rdquo;\n\nAnd then she returned to the silver city as wolves began to howl, the distant thunder drowning out their cries.\n\n_(4) Although both the Aspect of the Moon and Kindred were both worshipped as bringers of death, Piltover&rsquo;s Historia suggested that the moon warrior, too, had ultimately fallen to Kindred&rsquo;s arrows._\n\n_(5) The Aspect of the Sun&rsquo;s name is written in runes older than the book itself. _\n________________________________________\n**V: Brothers**\n\nWhen Aurelion Sol left the world in its balanced state, he knew the price of peace must eventually be paid. One winter night, Ornn awoke to a malevolent aura. His brother, Volibear, loomed close.\n\nOrnn met him atop the tallest mountain in the Freljord where the brothers battled. Fire and lightning tore the earth apart. The humans beneath perished in their feeble mortality.\n\nThe conflict ended when the sun rose, and both brothers saw how dead bodies littered the land. In his devastation Ornn retreated from the mortal world, willing his forges to never burn again. \n\nBut a small tribe of humans had survived. The aspects, save for one, could not comprehend how. With their weak bodies, the catastrophe should have been the catalyst for humanity&rsquo;s extinction.\n\nThus, **Hope** was learned and Anivia the cryophoenix rose for the first time in their ashes.\n________________________________________\n**VI: New Gods**\n\nUnbeknownst to both the divine and the mortal, a hole was ripped in the fabric of reality in the midst of the brothers&rsquo; battle. Upon the peak of a lonely mountain, its strength grew with each passing day.\n\nFrom its maw came the first voidspawn, the Watchers.\n\nThe Watchers are the ancestors of the voidlings. They grow stronger when people love and fear them. A hundred years after their coming, they gifted a single lesson to the humans:\n\n**Servitude**. You will know worship and sacrifice. (6)\n\n_(6) Fables suggest that a woman who calls herself Lissandra &lsquo;sold&rsquo; her people to the Watchers, who then enslaved them with black magic._\n________________________________________\n**Interlude**\n\n_Beasts cloaked in black ice. Eyes like sapphires. They were terrible to behold. I ran as soon as I saw them._\n\n_Now, it is so cold. So icy. It bites at me yet also soothes me, as if luring me into a slumber. I cannot feel my fingers anymore. My hands &ndash; they shake uncontrollably. My legs &ndash; they are so numb. But there is a warm feeling inside of me&hellip; why? _\n\n_It is like a lullaby._\n\n_I don&rsquo;t want to sl e e p_\n\n_I don&rsquo;t want to _\n\n_I don&rsquo;t _\n_._\n_(The writing suddenly stops.)_\n________________________________________\n**VII: The Iceborn**\n\nThe aspects may watch over my creation. They may guide them, but never directly interfere. That was the decree of the Aurelion Sol the Star Forger.\n\nWith Ornn&rsquo;s departure, the warmth of summer never again touched the Freljord. Some tribes crossed the land to find new homes. Those who remained succumbed to the Watcher&rsquo;s magic.\n\nBut the gift of **Healing** and **Warring** reminded one woman, whose name is Avarosa, that she was made to love and hate. She loved her people and hated those who enslaved her.\n\nAvarosa roused these feelings within her kin. Though they were imprisoned by the icy bonds of the Watchers, the aspects&rsquo; gifts had melted these shackles. \n\nThat night, the rebellious subjects warred against their masters upon a bitter bridge at the heart of the Freljord. \n\nAvarosa, wielding an enchanted bow, sighted her sister on the other side of the battlefield, dark and beautiful in the light of the moon. (7) She shot an arrow at Lissandra, weeping as Kindred guided it into the Ice Witch&rsquo;s heart. \n\nIn the bloody battle, the Iceborn, blessed by the strength of the **Protector**, hurled their wardens off the bridge and into the bottomless abyss below. They freed themselves, vowing to never be lose their dignities again.\n\nAnd thus, the void&rsquo;s first reign ended. \n\n_(7) The Ancients believed the Aspect of the Moon oversaw this night, for less than a tenth of the Iceborn survived the bloody battle._\n________________________________________\n\n_We have no gods but the Aspects\nFor their gift has granted us \nCourage\nKnowledge\nand Willpower_\n\n________________________________________\n**END OF TRANSLATION**\n\n**Notes:** This manuscript is a translation of the Freljordian Scriptures held by the Valoran Museum. As a result, it may not adhere to other existing historical scriptures written by foreign factions of Ancient Runeterra.\n\n(The most stark difference is between Freljordian and Ionian accounts. The ice tribes worshipped the aspects whereas Ionians found their peace within their God-tree.)\n\nFor more details, see Piltover&rsquo;s timeline, _Historia_. \n\nIllustrations further in the book suggest that the &lsquo;Watchers&rsquo; &ndash; or the voidspawn &ndash; revisited this planet. Similar events transpired in _Historia_, which details the fall of Icathia and the rise of creatures such as Malzahar.\n\nNevertheless, magic is no longer in this world. Aurelion Sol, if he ever existed, has left us to our own devices &ndash; as too have the Aspects of Targon. Ornn&rsquo;s forges are ashes in the wind and storms no longer herald the coming of Volibear. We should read these translations as what they truly are: simple bedtime fairy tales meant to ease restless children into a quiet sleep.","replies":[{"poster":"xLullaby","date":"2018-03-29T23:55:44.349+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oof. wowowowo\n\nThanks for noticing this!
