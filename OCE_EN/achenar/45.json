Subject was found convulsing and screeching, left forearm covered in blood as personnel attempted to subdue him. A total of 12 personnel were killed with a further 31 injured in the process; families of deceased personnel have been told their loved ones are to be on duty in Shurima until further notice.\n\nThe following transcripts were taken from subject&rsquo;s audiolog, recorded from the dates 6-[REDACTED] to 28-[REDACTED]:\n\n***\n\n**DAY 1**\nAfter days of searching, I&rsquo;ve finally found what appears to be an entrance to the Void just outside [REDACTED]. No signs of human disturbance, area seems to be dormant and not a creature in sight. Looks like the perfect spot for some cave exploring!\nAlright, entering the cave nnnnnnnnnow. \n&hellip;\nWell, my body&rsquo;s still intact and nothing&rsquo;s jumped out at me yet, so I think I&rsquo;m good to go.\n\n**DAY 2**\nWell this sucks. I&rsquo;ve been down here&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know how long, and I still haven&rsquo;t found anything interesting. I&rsquo;ve got supplies for just over a week though, so I&rsquo;ll keep looking for a couple more days, and if I don&rsquo;t find anything, I&rsquo;ll head out and block the entrance.\n\n**DAY 3**\nStill nothing. Continuing forward, marking the walls with the way I&rsquo;ve come.\n\n**DAY 4**\nLooks like this place has been dead for a long time. Chances are that this place has been here since before [REDACTED] was built. I would&rsquo;ve thought something that old would have something interesting, or something at all! Guess this place was a bust; heading back outside now.\n\n**DAY 5**\nOh, I must&rsquo;ve missed a tunnel on my way down. My markings had gone completely over a hole in the wall that I haven&rsquo;t been in. Let&rsquo;s take a look in here.\nWalls still glowy.\nTunnel still empty.\nLooking forward to&hellip; wait&hellip; is that&hellip; JACKPOT! Finally, something worthwhile. Not even worthwhile&hellip; just notable. It looks like some sort of gemstone. Let&rsquo;s see&hellip; violet in colour, putting out about 12 lumens, 6 centimetre quadrilateral&hellip; oh! Luminescence increases near my gauntlet, possible reaction to Shuriman technology? I&rsquo;ll investigate it back at the lab. Time to go back.\n\n**DAY 6**\nCuriosity got the best of me (as always) and I let the gemstone rest on my gauntlet. Gemstone appears to show some magnetic properties as it&rsquo;s able to stay on without help. Unable to verify at the moment, but gauntlet and gemstone appear to have either a mutualistic or commensal relationship with Mystic Shot gaining power. Could there be some connection between Shuriman technology and the Void? Keeping the two separate when not testing, just in case.\n\n**DAY 7**\nFurther testing shows that the two devices appear to strengthen the longer the two are together, similar to the Tear of the Goddess. Mystic shots appear to be even more powerful than yesterday. I should be at the entrance soon. Supplies should keep me stocked for a couple more days.\n\n**DAY 8**\nUrgh. Looks like one of the tunnels collapsed. I can either try to find another way or try to shoot my way through. Given the size of this labyrinth, I&rsquo;m sticking to my explorer&rsquo;s instinct and going back the way I came. A quick look at the structure shows that the walls around the tunnel can withstand a couple of shots.\n[NOISES IN BACKGROUND]\nHuh. The rocks are tougher than they appear. Might have to stick Mr. Gemstone on and see if that can get me out.\n[NOISES IN BACKGROUND]\nWell it did better than without, but it&rsquo;s still too weak. I&rsquo;m gonna leave it on and let it power up a bit.\n\n**DAY 9**\nSuccess! Only took me [REDACTED] hours, but the empowered shots made mincemeat of those rocks! Maybe I&rsquo;ll keep it on just in case anything else happens. My markings show I&rsquo;m near the top anyway, so it shouldn&rsquo;t matter too much. I can hear a faint whistle; it must be coming from outside.\n\n**DAY 10**\nAre these my markings? They have to be. I just don&rsquo;t remember this part of the cave at all. Maybe I could focus more if that whistling hadn&rsquo;t gotten so loud. Either way, I need to find the entrance soon. I&rsquo;m out of supplies. Maybe I do need a map&hellip; hahaha&hellip;\n\n**DAY 11**\nHaven&rsquo;t eaten for a day, but somehow feel fine. Maybe I&rsquo;m distracted from my hunger by this WHISTLING THAT WON&rsquo;T STOP. Still no entrance in sight. I hope the whistling getting louder means I&rsquo;m getting closer.\n\n**DAY 12**\nI&rsquo;m starting to forget what my markings looked like. I swear I&rsquo;ve never put those two together&hellip; SHUT UP FOR A SECOND. Yeah, I wouldn&rsquo;t have put those two together, because that would&hellip; JUST STOP. MAKE IT STOP.\n\n**DAY 13**\nI can&rsquo;t sleep. I don&rsquo;t even know if I need sleep, BUT IF I DID I COULDN&rsquo;T BECAUSE MY EARDRUMS FEEL LIKE THEY&rsquo;RE GOING TO BURST OUT OF MY HEAD.\n\n**DAY 14**\nAAAARGH. I CAN&rsquo;T THINK. ARE THESE WALLS MOVING? NO. NO. I&rsquo;M THE ONE THAT&rsquo;S MOVING. I CAN&rsquo;T STOP. GET ME OUT.\n\n**DAY 15**\nGET ME OUT.\nGET ME OUT.\nGET ME OUT.\nGET ME OUT.\nGET ME OUT.\n\n**DAY 16**\nIS IT THE GEMSTONE?\nIT&rsquo;S NOT THE GEMSTONE.\nMAYBE I SHOULD TAKE IT OFF AND SEE IF IT STOPS.\nI DON&rsquo;T WANT TO TAKE IT OFF.\nBUT WHAT IF IT IS?\nI DON&rsquo;T WANT TO TAKE IT OFF.\nI don&rsquo;t want to take it off.\n\n**DAY 17**\nMY MARKINGS. THEY&rsquo;RE EVERYWHERE. ON EVERY SURFACE. I HAVE TO MAKE MORE.\nBut I won&rsquo;t take it off.\n\n***\n\n[NO RECORDS FOUND FOR DAY 18-DAY 20]\n\n***\n\n**DAY 21**\nI HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT\nBut I won&rsquo;t take it off.\n\n**DAY 22**\nthE WAlls \nArE\nalIVe\nTHEY\nwAnT\nME\nBut I won&rsquo;t take it off.\n\n**DAY 23**\n&Atilde;v&yacute;&scaron;&iacute;&uacute;&oelig;&lsaquo;H -&Icirc;&ugrave;F&Yacute;&frac34;&frac34;T&acute;&lt;0 &lt;&hellip;&Acirc;&bdquo;xG&Ograve; &Yuml;&ucirc;&uuml;  &euro;&dagger;&Yacute;ž žŽ-l6&Ccedil;&Ccedil;&ecirc;&permil;G&Iacute;&ccedil;&curren;&Oslash;tl&Iuml;&divide; &curren;O&aacute;D&rsquo;&ldquo;&dagger;&atilde;a&agrave;&oacute;^[q^ &Oslash;q ž&ccedil;&yen;&brvbar;S&middot;q&sup1;&uuml;&uml;&sup1;~P&plusmn;\\&Scaron;&lt;&yen;8&ccedil;e&Euml;u&Yuml;&yen;&aring;N&tilde;;&szlig;&ucirc;\nk&Iacute;q1Z  ;A &Agrave;&Oacute;&curren;&eacute;z&hellip;&scaron;&hellip;qx&curren;SB&scaron;&reg;W&micro;\\3 &lt;&frac12;&Aring;U&Ucirc;&Yacute;&uml;&Ucirc;&Iuml;&Icirc;&szlig;0&scaron;&Egrave;&Uuml;&oacute;&laquo;&ordf;_i&acirc;&ocirc; &deg;&oacute;4 &lt;M&uuml;&euro;&macr;V-o&frac34;&lt;&Ecirc;&euml;u?(6&oelig;&ordm;&atilde;a&ETH;ž^&para;&ccedil;&Iuml;l&Ouml;ž&divide;&ugrave;%x_Žs&sup2;\\i&Ouml;&deg;&not; &agrave;!&Agrave;&euml;&Agrave;SuUDH&plusmn;i&pound;&uml;&aacute;Qx&Atilde;&otilde;&ndash;+ &Ccedil;&Ccedil;&Ucirc;&fnof; O1?&agrave;+&Otilde;&aelig;&Igrave;f&iacute;y&euml;&scaron;&iexcl;g&eth;=&uml;;&icirc;\\&plusmn;&dagger;&Icirc;G  &aring;&bull;C &eth;t&plusmn;&frac12;`j&pound; &Icirc;&oacute;&para;&iquest;Tn&reg;&times;m,xx&Uacute;5]&yuml;v&iexcl;&sup2;X&reg;&atilde;!&ndash;&euml;&szlig;*T6&ecirc;6^N     O&trade;&euro;&oacute;&Otilde;jsb&frac12;&Scaron;&iexcl;x&Oslash;\\?X*7f&lsaquo;&micro;&brvbar;&lsaquo;&divide;&raquo; žz&oelig;&oacute;R&Oacute;Y)&Iacute;n&Ouml;&Otilde;&gt;&atilde;l&Iuml;&Yuml;&Uacute;&uml;&Icirc;&euml;&uml;V  xH4 &lt;}&Acirc;&divide;a&aelig;&Scaron;u&Aring;&Atilde;&atilde;&oslash;&Aacute;l&plusmn;6&plusmn;^-7&Igrave;I \nBut I won&rsquo;t take it off.\n\n***\n\n[AUDIOLOGS FOR DAYS 24 TO 38 EMIT A HIGH FREQUENCY PITCH, GIVING LISTENERS A HEADACHE, VOMITING IN LONGER EXPOSURE.]\n\n***\n\n**DAY 39**\nTHE LIGHT\nIS\nBAD.\nI\nDO\nNOT\nWANT\nTHE LIGHT.\n\nHERE\n\nFOREVER\n\n\nBut I won&rsquo;t take it off.\n\n***\n\n[DAY 40 TO DAY [REDACTED] APPEAR TO BE COMPLETELY SILENT.
