Join us in the **Kookaburra Theatre** at PAX 2016, at **11AM on Friday 4th November**, to hear about their experiences and tips. Meet our panellists below!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/eOLCZWi.jpg\n\n[**Piltover Customs**](https://www.facebook.com/PiltoverCityCustoms/)\nPiltover Customs combines an ambition for creating huge props — like 2015's epic Braum shield — and an appreciation for making costumes that last. For his Uther the Lightbringer this year, he hand-crafted an entire set of black aluminium scalemail — and that was just the beginning.\n\n[**Zaphy Cosplay**](https://www.facebook.com/ZaphyCosplay/?fref=ts)\nZaphy&#039;s a cosplay veteran, and is responsible for this year&#039;s awesome DJ Sona cosplay at the OPL Grand Finals. She has a tendency to create amazingly detailed props &mdash; like her Aion Sorceror costume with a double set of huge feathered wings.\n\n[**Robb Props and Cosplay**](https://www.facebook.com/RobbPropsCosplay/?fref=ts)\nStephen from Robb Props and Cosplay is a mechanical engineer by trade, and he brings these skills to cosplay with his fully-functional, mechanical props. You can see his genius at work in OPL 2015&#039;s Viktor, and OPL 2016&#039;s Jayce.\n\n**Riot Achenar **\nAchenar is one of Riot&#039;s very own, and has been cosplaying for over ten years. Her favourite cosplays have been Kindred and Chell from Portal 2, but she is truly humbled by the talent of the panel&#039;s other guests. She&#039;s hoping to learn some extra tricks herself, as well as share some of what goes into Riot&#039;s cosplay programs.","replies":[{"poster":"VelKunt","date":"2016-10-21T13:05:49.884+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:62}}  Regi cosplay lul","replies":[]},{"poster":"Squeaker69","date":"2016-10-21T15:17:24.359+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:201}} Braum is here {{champion:201}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"BoomBoomDa","date":"2016-10-22T01:21:22.627+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is there any possbility to get pax skins","replies":[]},{"poster":"HERMES LAD","date":"2016-10-24T07:46:58.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:105}} hi","replies":[]},{"poster":"DaPackage","date":"2016-10-22T09:08:46.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"noooooooooooo why not sunday?????","replies":[]},{"poster":"EvIlDr0p8eAr","date":"2016-10-22T10:26:32.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"wait there's a Theatre named after me ? why am i only finding this out now \n{{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Puddo","date":"2016-10-22T05:22:40.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}  Pax skins please","replies":[]}]}
