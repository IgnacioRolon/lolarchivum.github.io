The quality of the entries you all sent through has had our judging panel tied up in knots trying to pick the winners. \n\nThe panel selected the winning entries based on their accuracy, the craftsmanship involved in creating their costumes, and their ability to embody the champion in personality and mannerism.\n\nWe have also decided to add an additional category of 8 honourable mentions on top of the 22 winners because the entries were just that good. \n\nBe sure to check out the full gallery of entries here: [http://woobox.com/a7yooe](http://woobox.com/a7yooe)\n\n**Winners:**\n\nAll winning entries will receive accommodation and flights to Sydney to be part of the Cosplay Showcase at the OPL Finals at Luna Park on August 8.\n\nsrobb\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ycnAUxa.jpg\n\nProcket\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Q3Yj3h4.jpg\n\nSashimiz\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Z67Juk0.jpg\n\nFluffy Shoggoth\nhttp://i.imgur.com/fwL4UPy.jpg\n\nbipolarized\nhttp://i.imgur.com/pDZa7is.jpg\n\nRock Lobstar\nhttp://i.imgur.com/z3Kl2SY.jpg\n\nSaerianne\nhttp://i.imgur.com/a6K0l7H.jpg\n\nXxpuffy\nhttp://i.imgur.com/DQSJwbC.jpg\n\nmangalphantom\nhttp://i.imgur.com/x0iMdns.jpg\n\nAstrokerrie\nhttp://i.imgur.com/z6qLHYv.jpg\n\nEnAmy\nhttp://i.imgur.com/XVM4hqj.jpg\n\nGwendoleen\nhttp://i.imgur.com/MfFl3He.jpg\n\nelizabethmaree\nhttp://i.imgur.com/OPyRPXS.jpg\n\nXelia\nhttp://i.imgur.com/UHUhPc2.jpg\n\nsnefasaurus\nhttp://i.imgur.com/FAL57KI.jpg\n\nBlondiee\nhttp://i.imgur.com/g7dWMkm.jpg\n\np1ng\nhttp://i.imgur.com/3JYWCv7.jpg\n\nxsteal\nhttp://i.imgur.com/RAZTA6L.jpg\n\nSchrodingers Lag\nhttp://i.imgur.com/XommAMq.jpg\n\nSupersonico\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dB3TTnX.jpg\n\nRAGA\nhttp://i.imgur.com/SwYgJpV.jpg\n\nKatey Smile\nhttp://i.imgur.com/VINZUTt.jpg\n\n\n\n\n**Honourable Mentions:**\n\nAll honourable mentions will receive a ticket to the OPL Finals and the OPL Show Bag.\n\n\nShadowstylez\nhttp://i.imgur.com/pVzqrnX.jpg\n\nCatRoulette\nhttp://i.imgur.com/4xwhIgZ.jpg\n\nEmberite\nhttp://i.imgur.com/v9gEISD.jpg\n\nStrayaTangerine\nhttp://i.imgur.com/z7t81t8.jpg\n\nSkyhuntress\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Gr4I43g.jpg\n\ndango4\nhttp://i.imgur.com/0h8SgMV.jpg\n\nwynterivy\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ElSteNU.jpg\n\nFasffy\nhttp://i.imgur.com/MM4mgcU.jpg\n\n\nIf you&rsquo;re coming to the OPL Finals at Luna Park, make sure to keep an eye out for these amazing cosplayers around the park and on the community stage!","replies":[{"poster":"saerianne","date":"2015-07-10T04:32:09.572+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"THANK YOU RIOT FOR THIS AMAZING OPPORTUNITY. <3 Can't wait to see everyone!","replies":[]},{"poster":"GeneralCoxy","date":"2015-07-10T02:54:00.911+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Freaking amazing.
