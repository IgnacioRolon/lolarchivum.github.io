Beneath it all, leaking into the forests, and then shaping the lives of its people, was an unimaginably large store of wild, cataclysmic magic. For many years, the deep-set magic of this land had been found and used by outsiders, utilised&mdash;stolen&mdash;by those unworthy of its power. \n\n_Balance will be restored, and I will be the one to restore it._\n\nThe young Lhotlan Vastayan kept to the shadows as she darted through the forest, following the innate calling of wild magic that drove her to its natural springs. Xayah&rsquo;s plumage darkened to blend in with the foliage around her. The shade beneath these trees was welcome; outside the boundaries of any Ionian forest, the heat was &hellip; strange-&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t hot, exactly, but the air was heavy, as though there was an unknown humidity weighing it down.\n\nOut of the corner of her eye, Xayah caught a glimpse of gold between the trees, of feathers catching the daylight streaming through pockets in the boughs. The sight of the following smile&mdash;a playful smirk of sorts&mdash;made her feel warm. Though moonlight and shadow were her preferred playgrounds, she was fine with certain types of sunlight.\n\n_Well, I&rsquo;m not the only one fighting for the Vastaya,_ she mused.\n\nXayah slowed to a cautious walk when the temperature dropped and then continued falling, like she had stepped onto the snow in the highlands. She was wary now. The shadows were deepening here, the darkness almost pulsing with the swaying boughs; it was familiar, this feeling of shifting magic, but it didn&rsquo;t feel like Ionian magic. It felt &hellip; _older_, more unstable. What was it?\n\n&lsquo;Xayah?&rsquo;\n\nA tall, striped ear twitched as Rakan stepped out of the trees and approached her. She tilted her head towards him for a moment before turning her attention back to the forest, measuring every step she took and studying every shadow for danger. The darkness _glittered_.\n\n&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like this,&rsquo; she said, looking at him. The glow and shine of his feathers had been dimmed; only the dark of night could produce the same effect. What was happening here? &lsquo;I think &hellip;&rsquo; She shook her head. She didn&rsquo;t know anything. &lsquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what I think. It feels &hellip; _wrong_. Like the trees have been tainted by something. You can&rsquo;t feel it?&rsquo;\n\n&lsquo;I can.&rsquo; He paused for a moment. A flicker of a memory crossed Xayah&rsquo;s mind; she remembered, with an accompanying ghost pain in her side, moving humanoid shadows. Ionia&rsquo;s magic hadn&rsquo;t even been safe from its own people. The Vastayans were both thinking the same thing. &lsquo;Do you think the humans have tampered with our magic again?&rsquo;\n\nRakan knew she had more dealings with humans, and he trusted her judgement when it came to their affairs, even if she was wrong. Sometimes. Xayah shook her head. &lsquo;This feels different.&rsquo;\n\nThe shadows made her anxious, but she knew she would never learn anything if she didn&rsquo;t inspect it closely, so she walked forward. The forest was darker than usual, almost as though day had suddenly turned to night in the few hours she and Rakan had been travelling.\n\nShe knelt in front of a clump of bushes clinging to the base of an old tree. Her voice was little more than a whisper, an audible thought. &lsquo;What _is_ this?&rsquo; She reached out and brushed her fingers across the leaves in front of her.\n\nGooseflesh rose across her fair skin; the back of Xayah&rsquo;s neck prickled. Instinctively, her ears went back, sharpening her face and making her worry&mdash;her anxiety&mdash;clear to anyone who looked at her. Her ears twitched as Rakan moved closer, his claws digging into the earth, the sound so soft it was almost impossible to hear.\n\n_What is happening to Ionia?_ Xayah had touched leaves, but she had also touched something else, something beneath them. Shadows weren&rsquo;t meant to glitter, and shadows couldn&rsquo;t be touched. The substance she once thought was shadow was cool against her fingertips. Against her flesh it was, strangely, transparent; she could see her own pale skin beneath it. She rubbed her fingers together. It was sticky, like drying saliva. Her brow furrowed. _Is that what this is?_\n\nShe wiped her fingers on the earth beneath her, stood, turned to Rakan, and then she froze. Her feathers bristled. She saw him tense in response.\n\nThere was a silhouette of some creature in the glittering shadows behind him. The sound it produced made Xayah feel ill&mdash;to her, it seemed that this shape, moving and becoming corporeal before her eyes, was _feasting_ on something.\n\nFour beady eyes shone as the daylight hit them; small, spindly arms shovelled slick plants and roots into its mouth. More of the glistening substance that coated the plants around her&mdash;Xayah now knew for sure that it was saliva, or at least some kind of digestive fluid&mdash;soaked into the earth beneath the creature. It was an alien thing, with a strangely protective hide, and it was consuming everything in front of it&mdash;Xayah watched in silent horror as it snapped up a critter and continued feeding. Why didn&rsquo;t it stop?\n\nWith a strange snuffling sound, it lifted its head. Xayah&rsquo;s feather daggers were already in her hands when it advanced, stumbling along on two stubby hind legs. Rakan was at her side in an instant, his feathers glowing faintly. The light seemed to catch the creature&rsquo;s attention. Its path towards them veered in his direction.\n\n_Good. It will make this easy,_ Xayah thought as she crept into the shadows, her feather daggers glowing faintly in the dark, _if he can keep it distracted._\n\nRakan kept the creature away; just as he did when he danced&mdash;he would say it was a dance if she mentioned it, and he would probably try and coax her into another dance while doing so&mdash;he moved swiftly, dodging the trails of bile it threw up in his direction when it got frustrated. Not a single drop touched him. His feathers were glowing brightly, casting golden light across the tree trunks. Across from them, Xayah was hidden in shadow. The creature&rsquo;s snuffling noises became angry.\n\nNow was her chance; it was distracted by its anger.\n\nHer feather daggers hit the ground behind the creature, the edges of each one slicing through the armour on its hide. Three more had been summoned and thrown before it had time to react to this new, more dangerous, presence. It stumbled around to face her and charged, stumbling along over the slick earth. Xayah&rsquo;s palm tingled as she recalled her feathers from the dirt where they lay, faintly glowing&mdash;eight of them should have been enough to silence this new threat.\n\nAn estranged cry escaped from the creature before more bile&mdash;_what else could it be?_&mdash;spewed from the creature&rsquo;s throat. This was different than before; it was a bright violet stream, and more of the same substance began leaking from the creature&rsquo;s hide.\n\nXayah stumbled back as the creature hobbled its way over to her. Why wasn&rsquo;t it dead? Her feathers should have been enough. The creature&rsquo;s body heaved as it got closer to her.\n\nShe didn&rsquo;t see Rakan move, she was too busy stressing about the creature that _should be dead_, but he was suddenly there. She was vaguely aware that he spun to face her&mdash;even with an undead threat still nearby he couldn&rsquo;t help but crack a smile&mdash;but she was almost blinded by the sight of his cape flaring out between her and the dying alien beast.\n\nHe stumbled a little, almost pushed into her by some unknown force, and when he turned to glance at the creature, his ears twitching, Xayah was finally able to see exactly what had happened. What remained of the creature was a husk, a shell. The trees, the earth, even Rakan&rsquo;s feathers, were covered in purple fluid.\n\nWhat was happening to Ionia? First Noxus had attacked, now this? Whatever that creature was, it wasn&rsquo;t of Ionian design. Xayah knew that in a heartbeat. When Ionians died, they stayed dead. Even most Noxians had the decency to do the same. The creature that attacked her, that had invaded her home, was nothing she had ever seen before. Even Rakan&rsquo;s warmth did little to mask the dread and confusion she felt.\n\nWas it the Unknown, the Void, that had sent this creature? If that truly was the case, if the Void had somehow found a foothold here, like the clinging shadows suggested, what other monstrosities lurked in the darkness of that terrible place, ready to spring forth and consume Ionia?","replies":[]}
