You're not ineligible for the competition but the final top 10 will be determined by the aggregate highest-voted across all three. So for example if you smash round 2 and 3 out of the park, you could definitely still be up there - but your 'score' to reach that final top 10 will be competing with artists who entered all three rounds.\n\nHope this makes sense - let me know if not! I'd definitely love to see your work. :D","replies":[{"poster":"Psylock1234","date":"2018-05-08T01:35:11.819+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"that kinda sucks for me I'm a beginner artist and didn't enter the first one because of my broken hand XD but I will still try!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ahh McKayn","date":"2018-05-14T07:56:22.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Achenar is there any way I can get in contact with you personally ?
