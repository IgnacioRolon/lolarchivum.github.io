My playstyle is that I like to sit back and play patiently until I see an opportunity to go in. I hear that ADCs like Caitlyn, Ashe, MF, and Jhin are good for this.\r\n\r\nMy mechanics are not too bad although they can be improved like most other things.\r\n\r\nApart from the heroes listed above, what other heroes would be appropriate? I would like suggestions for Jungle and Support if possible in case I don&#039;t get to play ADC.\r\n\r\nThanks again guys!","replies":[{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-05-03T06:13:05.720+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you would like to play support that has a passive playstyle and is more reactionary in terms of waiting to peel or disengage the enemies engage.\nI'd highly recommend you play Janna :) if you want to poke more in lane and deal more dmg in the lane phase try lulu or nami. Nami and lulu can poke decently in lane compared to janna who has a lower auto attack range which puts you at disadvantage against other ranged supports who also deal more damage than you... such as sona .Those are some of the champs I've found that really suit my play style which is passive unless my adc decides to go aggressive and trade in lane. {{champion:40}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:117}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"atroquinine","date":"2017-04-29T05:11:48.808+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"in terms of jungle, you generally want to be quite active, but perhaps a farm-heavy scaling jungler like graves or supportive style in ivern would suit you. for support, janna/raka/lulu can play very passively and reactively","replies":[]}]}
