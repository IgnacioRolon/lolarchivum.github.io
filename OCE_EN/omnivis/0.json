I can see this being a problem to balance though, if one ability is distinctly better to empower than the other then it will more likely just limit her gameplay.\nI&#039;ve also considered this &#039;An eye for an eye&#039; concept as her new passive and have it buff each of her abilities, and instead move her current passive to _**Q - Reckoning**_.\n\n_**W - Divine Blessing**_\nActive: _Kayle blesses the target allied champion or herself, healing them and granting them bonus movement speed for 3 seconds._\n\nBasic but effective, this is what makes Kayle different from the next auto attacking madman (madwoman) and is the reason she can support.\nIf the &#039;An eye for an eye&#039; idea is incorporated into Kayle&#039;s kit, the numbers on this can just be tweaked and it&#039;s good to go!\n\n_**E - Righteous Fury**_\nPassive: _Kayle&#039;s basic attacks deal bonus magic damage._\n\nAll good.\n\nActive: _Kayle ignites her sword for 10 seconds, gaining bonus attack range, doubling Righteous Fury&#039;s on-hit damage, and causing her basic against non-turret enemies to splash to nearby enemies for the duration._\n\nDefining ability for Kayle. The only problem I have with it is how I&#039;m left feeling powerless while it&#039;s on cooldown, I&#039;m meant to have 2 other basic abilities and an ultimate ability right? What I&#039;d like is for the active&#039;s window of opportunity to be more controllable.\nI think it should be similar to Garen&#039;s _**E - Judgment**_ in the sense that Kayle can cancel the active portion of _**E - Righteous Fury**_ to refund some of the cooldown (this would probably require the cooldown to start after the ability ends)\n**OR**\nIt should have a toggle effect with a limited duration which costs mana (per second? per attack?) with a cooldown afterwards, similar to Maokai&#039;s _**R - Vengeful Maelstrom**_\n\n_**R - Intervention**_\nActive: _Kayle bathes the target allied champion or herself in holy light, rendering them immune to all damage for a few seconds._\n\nWith all the new ally protection abilities that have come out; _**R - Lamb&#039;s Respite**_, _**R - Cosmic Radiance**_, _**R - Tempered Fate**_, _**W - Devour**_, etc. Kayle&#039;s ultimate feels outclassed. I feel like it needs some utility, maybe a decaying movement speed buff for the duration? Maybe some crowd control reduction? It just need a defining characteristic; like how _**R - Lamb&#039;s Respite**_ creates a temporary safe haven for everyone, or _**R - Cosmic Radiance**_ being a delayed spell with a huge payoff if timed correctly.\n\nAnyways, CONGRATULATIONS if you made it through my rant.\nPlease leave any thoughts you have, I want to hear them.","replies":[{"poster":"CoeAstral","date":"2016-07-06T04:03:15.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the defining ability of Kayle IS her problem, to be quite honest. Her E is iconic, but also one if, if not, the most broken ability in the game. Now, Say i'm a kog'maw. You know me, I deal sht loads of HP damage on you in SECONDS. Kayle does that. On a support. \"support\". its not Okay. Yes, she can be played mid, jungle, top, bot, supp. If you notice, Kayle literally has the tools do deal with ANYTHING sent her way. Bad teamfight call? Ulti and use your heal and slow to dash away at sonic speeds. Got an opponent tank? Use {{item:3153}} and rip through them faster than Sam Pepper's Career with your mix of AP and AD burst. And you might say \"Hard CC shuts her down\". No. {{champion:203}} would like to say otherwise. these two are my nightmares. A double invulnerable ulti that takes everything you ever had and flushes it down the drain. Generally, I wouldn't like to gut {{champion:10}} of her kit, but in general it just... isn't fair. Harass, sustain, and the only thing holding her down is mana. Or should say 'dampening' because other than her early game, buy {{item:3174}} and laugh as your opponent cannot use AP to subside you, you do MASSIVE healing, and add to an already devastating AP stat. She either needs \n\n1: Removal of AP/AD application on her E. She just does too much damage. Make it deal true damage, or something that is less... promoting her to go full out assault and demolish people late game\n2. A Reworked passive. It's simply too strong. I'm not one to say \"trundle OP\" but the fact that Kayle can temporarily gut 15% of your tank stats is SCARY. Rapid-fire and at a range too, thanks to her E. Especially as a top laner who enjoys Tank characters, this is possibly the most frightening passive in the game.\n3. Ult? PROMOTE IT. People say \"Taric has it for like, your whole team.\" yes. like 2.5 seconds with a massive cast time. Kayle has this INSTANTLY. for 3 seconds. Put that in on a fizz and watch as he assinates their whole backline, or your tumbling under-fed Vayne, and make her slay anything by simply walking forward. This is HIGHLY underrated. Kindred makes this even better by the \"You cant go under 10% HP\" rule. And with Reworked Taric, you can force your opponent to kiss their ass goodbye. Add a sivir? Mach 10 invulnerable team. Add a tank like Mundo or heavy CC like Zac? Welp, there's only one way to say it: GG\n\nKayle is just... Too good. I hate saying \"champ OP\" but Kayle just gets the job done. yes, she can fall behind, but if you even meet the standard of her mid game, which with your absurd early harass you most certainly will with cheese-ease, your opponent either has to try and have a tank build around her, or the entire team buys {{item:3075}} and someone hopefully picks something with enough CC or silence to stop you in your tracks.\n\nNow, I know I'm still fairly new by standards, but as a newcomer, I cant see why I WOULDNT want to pick {{champion:10}}, but the meta is so focused on e-sports balance that few rarely notice her. \n\nThanks for reading, and hope you have a fantastic day.","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-07-06T18:00:45.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Simple reasons why not to pick Kayle\n\nA) Limited range duration\nB) Lack of mobility\nC) Relatively squishy and definitely not a tanky\nD) no hard CC\nE) Vulnerable to hard CC\nF) Weak early game\nG) Low play making potential\nH) In terms of fun is quite binary for some\nI) Susceptible to being bursted down\nJ) Auto attack range with righteous fury isn't very amazing. \nK) Weak to fighters and assassins who have gap closers like Riven. \nThe fact is can be applied instantly as an ultimate but only to a single person also means you have to situationally apply it and to teammates who aren't yourselves\nBtw would never build thornmail against Kayle and a spirit visage or banshees veil would be a much better choice.","replies":[{"poster":"CoeAstral","date":"2016-07-12T03:58:20.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, good reasons, but like I said, A, B, C, F, and K aren't really applicable with proper comps. Yes, it does mean its reliant, but it also means there is a lot of power in her kit that is just waiting to be unleashed. You can say she's not tank, but build partially tanky with lifesteal, like BotRK, and a lot of damage can be migitated through simple lifesteal effects. also, like I said, her mid and early game is QUITE survivable, people don't apply the invuln and respond, or simply don't know how to build her. She can be bursted down, but that means you could also risk the fact that she could just ult herself and force all attack power dealt to nothingness. play making? Dude, like I said, throwing that on a vayne or someone quite important is a pretty major play, and can make some carries downright scary for temporary amounts of time. as for Binary? Yes? She's two-sided, but that helps in the fact that she can become one or the other instantly. If zed is an assassin, he's an assassin. he's stuck to a role. Kayle can swap that around quite easily, support or mid-lifesteal tank. Gap closers is sort of a reason, but like I said, a good Kayle WONT be caught out, cause those spells both SLOW opponents and SPEED you up. The only way to truly get through that is to have another character built around ignoring those affects like Yi, and even then Kayle will just auto him to death. There is also no reason to buy either Spirit Visage or Banshee unless you're a tank who can survive the pure burst already which is highly unlikely, and spirit visage means you're a tank that heals, and you'll essentially being trying to outheal a self-healer through lifesteal, which is pretty hard to say the least. Limited durations don't really apply here either, cause literally EVERYTHING has CDR nowadays (Thx rito for my 10% CDR {{item:3083}} ). Like I said. take this team comp for consideration:\n {{champion:111}}\n {{champion:203}}\n {{champion:44}} \n{{champion:10}} \n{{champion:15}} or instead of sivir, {{champion:67}} .\n You have a team comp that is almost impossible to truly get rid of without serious damage and silence potential. And that's excluding the fact that with Vayne AND Kayle, any tank on their team is GG'd, or Sivir to simply run in or away from teamfights that break out. Naut controls the field so if they group kayle and the ADC go ham, Taric can lock in stun with anyone, and kindred can resolve a bad forced fight, and Taric can AoE his allies to ensure pure survival. meanwhile, Kayle can save ulti for anything important, or even protect Taric as he channels his own. Kayle can act as literally anything and make it work. Force her as a lifesteal tank in the midlane, and if they have an assassin, your team comp nullifies them 3 times over. People just simply underestimate characters not Meta-friendly cause they want to be the next Faker, so certain champs that don't fit criteria are usually tossed away, even if their win rates show otherwise (RIP: {{champion:83}} , your LCS dream will be remembered). The pure power in Kayle's kit is unmatched, and added to others, it turns her into a monster.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
