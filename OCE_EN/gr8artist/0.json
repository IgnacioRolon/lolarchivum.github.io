Annie has a bad bug where a readied stun will get lost if she uses Q (slow projectile) but then hits W (instant cone) before Q lands. I have it happen every time I play her, I&#039;ve asked others and they&#039;ve noticed it too, and it has yet to be addressed. It&#039;s been a problem for years.\r\nI wouldn&#039;t mind if the W would stun instead of the Q, but the problem is that NEITHER of the abilities will stun.\r\n\r\n2. Does reporting people for AFK even matter? DOTA at least informs you that disciplinary action has been taken with someone. In LOL you just click the little red button and hope for the best. There&#039;s no feedback, so it feels like nothing&#039;s getting done.\r\n\r\n3. I have a slow computer but I can usually play LOL alright. Sometimes I get DC&#039;d though, which I don&#039;t have a problem with. What I DO have a problem with is when I sit through the long, solo loading screen and finally enter the game, only to have the &quot;you have been disconnected due to inactivity&quot; message pop up, and have LOL disconnect me AGAIN for no reason. Is there a way to change it so that the inactivity timer only counts while you&#039;re actually connected to the game? Because I was once disconnected from the same game 3 times, finally entering play at about the 15 minute mark. My own shitty comp is at fault for about 5 of those, sure, but League&#039;s asinine server system kept kicking me out after I&#039;d load in.\r\nAlso, is the chat box supposed to just say &quot;reconnected&quot; instead of also telling you WHO reconnected?\r\n\r\n4. Why is Manamune still recommended for Ashe? It made sense when she had an on-hit mana-cost ability, but now it seems like she uses a standard ADC item set. Why isn&#039;t Infinity Edge in her &quot;main&quot; or &quot;primary&quot; (can&#039;t remember the term right now) suggested item box, instead of Manamune?\r\n\r\n5. Can we bring back something like the old Banner of Command? It was a favorite for Heimer/Malz but now it&#039;s gone. \r\n\r\n6. Why don&#039;t boots stack? Is it a carry-over from the original DotA/WC3 system or something? If we&#039;re limiting equipment based on logic, I think we should cap it at 2 weapons, or perhaps only the same type of weapon your champion is using. It doesn&#039;t make a lot of sense to allow 6 swords and axes but no more than 1 pair of shoes.\r\n\r\n7. Can we get a &quot;Zac-in-the-box&quot; skin, please?\r\n\r\n8. The bright-and-sickly yellow color of &quot;Warmog&#039;s Heart&quot; in Warmogs&#039; tooltip is garish.\r\n\r\n9. Would it theoretically be possible to have players choose &quot;competitive&quot; or &quot;casual&quot; when they&#039;re entering a queue, and only be put with other players using the same choice? Because people get bitchy when you want to try something uncommon or off-the-wall, or they get too uptight about every little thing. It&#039;s the main reason I typically play ARAM, because there are far less (but still many) people who get stressed about the game there.\r\n\r\n10. Can there be an option to use the old UI/HUD? Everything is tiny now, ugly colored, and needlessly cluttered. I&#039;m also not a fan of having to mouse-over the images to see summoner names. At least let us re-position the different parts of the HUD (moving champs back to the top left corner, for example). Also, AD is always highlighted even when it&#039;s getting no buff from items, runes, or masteries. \r\n\r\n11. The concept behind Kalista is great, but don&#039;t ever feel safe playing her because there&#039;s always DCs and AFKs and she has no ult and a diminished passive without her buddy. Can there be some option to form a new/temporary bond with someone else when your bonded team-mate DCs or trolls you?\r\n\r\n12. Why aren&#039;t there more AP ratios on AD-based champs? Garen, for example, might be fun to play with some AP items, but he has no ratio to justify them. It seems like if you gave champs like him an AP ratio, you&#039;d be giving players options without changing hardly anything about their relative strength or standing. Malz is a good example of the inverse. He benefits from AD, but it&#039;s a lot harder and notably weaker than playing him AP. Why make more champs the other way around? AD champs would be balanced around their AD, but would have a couple of options to make AP at least viable.\r\nExperienced players (like the guy who got me into LoL) might appreciate trying something different or unexpected in the matches when they&#039;re teamed up with newer proteges. \r\n\r\nPS, the Death Recap fix is much better than it used to be, but I still keep seeing a glitch where it says I did a little damage to myself with someone else&#039;s face.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, and feel free to discuss as desired.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-08-21T14:32:00.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Help & Support page might bee more useful.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-08-22T06:57:11.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or you know, NA boards instead of OCE boards.","replies":[{"poster":"KrimsonDeath","date":"2015-08-24T14:42:38.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=A8n4fqRa,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-08-22T06:57:11.968+0000)\n>\n> Or you know, NA boards instead of OCE boards.\n\nThis rude guy just comes on the forums to be a jerk to everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-08-24T15:24:20.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How was that being a jerk?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
