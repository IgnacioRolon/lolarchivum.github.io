That was 3 out of 5, the 4th and5th went yi and jax jungle and afk farmed all game then when my adc (I was sup) stole enemy red, he jumped up and smited it to steal it despite already having his own red. When I asked why yi wouldnt gank he replied \"only noobs rely on ganks\" enemy team had a pyke jungle that game and got all objectives.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what's up with all these Chinese players randomly transferring over and griefing games? \r\n\r\nP.S This is low elo (Silver IV) so it isn't some form of boosting strat or anything like that.\r\nP.P.S I say \"A LOT\" because even if it is only 5, those 5 were all met within the past two days","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-09-23T11:28:20.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"1. I don't see how this is at all relevant to 'Chinese' players.  This seems like pretty standard behaviour that is found in league regardless of race.\n\n2. What is the context of them _**'saying they recently transferred in'**_?  Because people don't just blurt out their information randomly.  If they do, it's almost certainly false.  E.g. if someone spawned into game and said **_\"Hey all &lt;3 Gamer girl here! how you doin? ;D\"_** are you going to believe them? No.  So if someone starts the game, says a couple of words in Chinese, then announces to the world _**\"I just transferred from China.\"**_  why would you assume that is the truth?\n\n\n> it is just specifically only Chinese players transferring in at the moment\n\nWhere is this statistic coming from?\n\n__________\n\n\nBut let's pretend everything is as you say, and the majority of toxic players right now are Chinese people transferring in.  I'm curious to what exactly you want done about it?\n\nDo you want to ban Chinese people from transferring accounts to OCE?  Or otherwise specifically target players of that nationality?\nBecause that would be only _slightly_ incredibly racist.  And community backlash aside, it would be rather awkward for Riot, seeing as they are in-fact owned by a Chinese company.\n\nOr do you want a crackdown on this sort of behaviour?  If so, it is completely irrelevant what nationality the players are who act like this are, because all players would have to be affected equally.  In which case, calling out any particular race serves no purpose other than to shame people of that nationality.  Which again, is not only unhelpful, but discriminatory.","replies":[{"poster":"Steaming Ice","date":"2019-09-23T13:30:31.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well some also do type something in chinese in all chat to which someone else generally replies again in chinese. only 2 said they transferred from China which was when I questioned the whole stealing red thing. If you actually read my post youd know I just wanted to know if there was any reason it seems to be Chinese players that \"transferred\" and call me \"shabi\" for saying don't steal the adcs cs bro or where is your sup item.\n\nAlso, yes, this type of behaviour should be stopped. The reason I specifically named Chinese players, is, AGAIN (did you even read ANYTHING?) because these experiences are limited to only Chinese players. I didn't mention afking or inting because ofc every race has those types. I just find it extremely odd that 3 out of 5 Chinese players went Annie sup with no sup items stealing cs, kills and jungle buffs and the other 2 were yi and jax jung with the same problems.\n\nIs Annie sup with no sup items and stealing cs/kills/buffs not overly specific? I find it to be pretty damn specific. \n\nBut again, my post isnt about banning chinese players or stopping trolls, dont put words in my mouth. It's asking if anyone happens to know why this overly specific scenario keeps happening. EG are China servers lagging for example? Is OCE just a super easy server to win on for everyone else and they arent too far to be majorly affected by lag? Why specifically Annie sup with no sup items and fight over cs all game? \n\nPretty much asked every question except for the only ones you tried to answer. Enough with forcing everything to be a politically correct battleground, it's pathetic.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-09-23T15:26:03.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Both Yi and Jax have very high attack speed, and are great chasers.\nIt's highly likely that red buff would have been a lot more useful on either of them than your ADC _(depending on who the ADC was)_, likely they made that judgement call and took it _(not a particularly friendly or polite call, but then again not everyone is friendly or polite are they?)_.  Hogging buffs and not ganking is pretty standard behaviour for crappy Junglers, I don't see how that is 'Chinese specific' behaviour.\n\n________________\n\nAnnie is a bursty mage with an easy to land CC ability.  Those champions have become very very popular in bot lane this past season.  Brand/Vel/Annie/Neeko etc.  \n\nAnnie has to use 4 spells to gain her stun.  Her W costs 70 mana at rank one _(rather costly)_, and her E has a long cooldown, and is her only defensive ability.  So neither spell is good to spam just to get the stun ready.  Her Q however, refunds half of its mana, and ALL of its cooldown if it kills a minion.  So if she takes minions she can get the stun up very quickly.  \nAnd it's a long stun, definitely a game-changer in any lane, let alone a lane with an ADC to capitalise upon in.  Many _(not all)_ ADCs would happily sacrifice some CS to have that targetable stun up a lot.  \n\n_**That's why she's taking CS.**_\n\nIf Annie is taking CS in order to get her stun up, then she already has some gold income, making a support item less essential.  The support item that Annie buys is Spelltheif's edge.  Spelltheif's edge has a passive that slows gold generation if you kill minions.  So if she is killing minions, she making her already less useful support item not work as effectively.  Making it fairly redundant.  I haven't done the maths, but It could well be more gold efficient for her to to just build damage instead, considering her strong early and mid game.  \n\n_**That's why she's not buying support times.**_\n\nAnnie does a lot of damage.  In the early and mid game, she almost certainly will be pumping out more damage than the ADC, even as a support, and her damage comes in large chunks.  So it's highly likely that her large chunk of damage will secure the kill over the ADC's small but frequent chipping away.  So the chances of getting the kill, are definitely in her favour.  A good support (especially one taking farm) will stop attacking when the enemy is low, to let the ADC pick up the kill.  But you don't always get that luxury in a fight.  And if they are picking a bursty mage like Annie support, chances are they are just a butthurt midlaner that got autofilled anyway, so they're more than happy to just play 'mid' in bot lane.  \n\n**_That's why she's taking kills._**\n\nAs for why you've seen 3 Annies in 2 days, it could be any number of reasons.  Perhaps a YouTuber or Pro-player made a play involving Annie support, and everyone is jumping on the bandwagon.  Perhaps someone tried it and it did really well, and other people in that game decided to try it, and it branched out from there.  Or perhaps it's just coincidence, Annie is a fairly well played champ, and taking her support isn't the most crazy thing in this meta.  Seeing 3 Annies in bot lane over 2 days isn't that far-fetched.  Theres probably hundreds of Annie supports every day, you just happened to find 3 of them.\n\n___________________________\n\nSo I still fail to notice anything that is inherently 'Chinese' about this behaviour.  It all seems pretty standard stuff.\n\nPlus your sample size is hilariously small, just 2 days? If you've been playing for 2 months and every single Annie support was spouting bucketloads of Kanji at everyone, then maybe you'd be forgiven for thinking theres a connection.  But two days isn't enough time to give an accurate sample.\n\nAs for the number of 'Chinese' people; let's say you play 3 games a day. Over two days thats 6 games. in each game there are 10 people, that's 60 people.  The chances of 5 of those 60 people being Chinese, is not abnormal at all, in-fact considering NZ and Australia's large Chinese population, 5 out of 60 is actually a very small number.  And even then there's no guarantee that these players are even Chinese, anyone can google translate a sentence.   So from where i'm standing, it really doesn't seem like a _massive epidemic_.  5 out of 60 people is far from a mass exodus from China.\n\nSo yes, it does look a little like picking unnecessarily on Chinese people.  Considering everything here is relatively standard behaviour for your average inconsiderate player, and only 5 players in two days happened to be maybe Chinese.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2019-09-23T16:50:37.559+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"That's why she's taking CS.\nThat's why she's not buying support times.\nThat's why she's taking kills.\"\n\nThis must be why that's what all Annie supports do all the time and it's not like higher MMR players would you know, build a support item... or not take kill's/CS.\n\nYep, it's not being toxic at all.\n\n\"And even then there's no guarantee that these players are even Chinese, anyone can google translate a sentence.\"\n\nDo you google translate sentences mid game all the time?\n\nOr hell reply to someone also speaking in chinese considering that most non-chinese have no way to get a sentence in game out of the game to translate both ways?\n\nCause it's amazing, i as a non-chinese speaking player can't do that.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-09-24T09:49:56.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey hey, let’s backtrack for a sec here, you’ll notice I never said that’s what an Annie support ‘_should_’ do, or that they aren’t being toxic by doing it.
