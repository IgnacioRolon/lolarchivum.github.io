However League differs in one key feature. When the match is a 4v5, the points u lose in MMR are halved. If it is 3v5 or lower the loss is prevented. The people who have left however are banned for a period of time, and they lose MMR points. Should this be introduced into League? I think it'd be pretty cool.","replies":[{"poster":"Best Viktor AU","date":"2015-01-26T06:40:53.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And what game has this feature?","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-01-26T06:56:25.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"made up one. same way people explain other suggestions that are brain dead stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"Bytez","date":"2015-01-26T11:15:40.178+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Even if it is just his suggestion, there's no need to be rude about it.
