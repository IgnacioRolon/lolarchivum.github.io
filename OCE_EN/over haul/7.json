The reality is that gold anywhere on your team is going to be beneficial.

In fact, Gold is probably going to be more useful on your support until about the 20 minute mark.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-06T03:28:22.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How is gold more useful on the support till the 20 minute mark?\n\nI'm curious to hear some bullshit.","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-06T07:49:07.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Till 20 maybe not, but till 10-15, definitely yes.\nA support that can tank his way trough the fight and repeatedly stun whoever gets closer is arguably more useful than, say, an infinity edge on a blood splat.\nEver saw a fed Leona?
