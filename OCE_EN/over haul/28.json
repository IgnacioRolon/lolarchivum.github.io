Luckily it seems that these chromas may only be timed exclusives.\n\n\"4. How do the giveaways work?\nEvery few patches, one of the new skins will include an exclusive chroma only available through codes given to content creators. There may be ways for other players to obtain those chromas in the future, but donâ€™t have plans for that at the moment.\"\n\nfor reference:\nhttps://partners.leagueoflegends.com/en_AU/ \n\nSo yes it does suck for the moment, but at the very least it does look like we may get access to it eventually and they have stated it is not a true limited chroma. We just do not know how yet or how long it will take if they do make it available later. The most we can do at the moment is state our concern so they do follow through on making another way to obtain it in the future (Hopefully they do not add another layer of exclusivity to it like a border if they do though as that would suck).","replies":[]}]}
