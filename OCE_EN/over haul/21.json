I&#039;m not QQ&#039;ing about not playing my favorite roll in fact I enjoy most rolls but I&#039;m sure that getting a Russian roulette of players    getting rolls often hinders the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-08-23T07:31:43.729+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is something Riot is working on but the thing you have to remember is that TB and ranked are two completely different breeds. Getting them to work together is difficult and obviously takes a lot of time to work out how it would be done.

It's possible that it will become \"pick position and role\" then it finds 9 other people then you go through a draft style champion select. Either way it will be interesting to see what they come up with.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-08-23T20:59:16.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, well good luck riot, I guess.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"just2jiG","date":"2015-08-23T09:50:54.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The queues might do some weird stuff with team MMR.\n\nThey would have to rework the team builder itself so you can have a captain banning .","replies":[]}]}
