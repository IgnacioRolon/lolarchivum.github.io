I know that a lot of champions that didn't make it into live play often have parts of their kits salvaged and put into new champs. \n _(e.g. I believe that Tahm Kench's devour was originally supposed to be part of Mega Gnar's kit.)_\n\nBut I personally don't see why they don't just make all 3 skins, and release them over the next few years? if they are letting us choose, it means they are obviously satisfied with any of them being in live play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-10-31T01:38:54.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait what's this about?\n\nEdit: Nevermind saw Sessh post","replies":[]}]}
