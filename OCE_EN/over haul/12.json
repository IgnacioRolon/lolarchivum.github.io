Based on previous events there will likely be:\n- a T-shirt of some form, probably OPL specific (this might only be for actual OPL and not the streams, I believe that was the case when I went in 2016)\n- a lanyard possibly (again might not be for the streams or for this event)\n- a skin code, usually a relatively recent release and epic quality\n- a wrist band, usually Teemo\n- a stress ball of some kind, past ones include Maokai saplings, poros and as Overburn mentioned Meeps\n- thundersticks!\n\nOf course none of that is guaranteed, and there may be some other different goodies as well or some that are specific to the actual event and not for just the streams. The usually release a more specific list at some point but seems like they might not this year.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Over Haul","date":"2018-08-26T23:40:15.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Side note, I had no idea that cinemas could stream videos","replies":[]},{"poster":"TF Blade","date":"2018-08-26T22:05:00.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well if it helps at all, I went to the OCE Rift Rivals finals and we all got a goodie bag.
