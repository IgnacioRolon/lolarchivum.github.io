Which it&#039;s not. so I decided to just cop it and reset my password using a recovery email but I received no email after 10 minutes. The Email that it was sending to should be the correct one as it has not changed online.  However, I&#039;m still logged on on the riot website so I tried to change my Email. It required me to enter my password which it thinks is wrong so I couldn&#039;t do that either. Finally, I tried to just change my password but I have to enter my password which it thinks is wrong. Honestly, wtf?  Can someone from Riot please help me to fix this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2018-05-04T07:09:10.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your account had its password reset proactively after suspicious activity. A password reset email should have already been sent to the email tied to this account, the email was verified back in March. So whichever email address you used to verify the account is the one you should check. I'd also check any spam filters.\nFailing this, you can submit an account recovery ticket [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[{"poster":"L3xxTh3B0mb","date":"2018-05-04T07:12:49.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your help.
