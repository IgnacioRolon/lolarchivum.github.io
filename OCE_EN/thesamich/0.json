My league was acting laggy after that, so i closed it and opened it again. It came up with the &quot;you have left a game in progress, please try to reconnect&quot;  alert. Then the real problems started. Here are some screenshots of the alerts i was getting. If i pressed the &#039;reconnect&#039; button on any of them, the screen goes black for a while then the error alerts come up. If i try to close my league client, I get the time penalty thing. I have tried restarting my league, but it just continues with the problem. Ended the task on the task manager and the same thing happened. Plz help, i really want to keep playing.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Noah","date":"2016-04-29T14:55:32.408+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i got same problem!

This happened to me at 12:05 or so A.M. today. It was a hard game but we ended up winning the game (i was playing Bard) and i couldnt load the end game stats so i waited and eventually went to bed.\n \nThis is a game in challenger and its painful to (from what ive seen so far on this forum board) know i probably wont get the LP from that game, hopefully however riot sorts this out soon.
