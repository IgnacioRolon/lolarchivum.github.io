The 0 salt maximum sugar team is back baby.\r\n\r\nWe are looking for a solid mid-laner, someone who knows their shit. Though we do not expect you to win lane every game, we expect you to be able to play a few champions (with decent KDA, 3~4+) + have a few sneaky pocket picks ready. \r\n\r\n- THE ONLY RANK WE WILL ACCEPT ARE FROM PLAT 5 TO PLAT 1!!\r\n- We are strictly a CASUAL team, be on at anytime, start and stop whenever you want. We prefer having someone playing everyday but hopefully we get a few people.\r\n- We use Discord for voice chat but can also work with skype.\r\n- Legit serious about that 0 salt thing though and expect it from us because we expect it from you!\r\n\r\nWe have a solid Top, jungle, support and ADC. We don&#039;t always play 5&#039;s because not everyone is on at the same time {{item:3070}} \r\n\r\nWe are a group of people just looking to have fun and climb together.\r\n\r\nSo what are you waiting for?
