Repeat offenders are penalized which I think is fair.\n\nOn the other side not losing the lp for the loss would result in people deliberately afking when they thought they were going to lose causing another problem.\n\n\nOnly thing I would suggest is if a team does manage to win the 4v5 match their should be a bonus for that (which Riot can correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think there is).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jehovahs Witness","date":"2017-03-12T00:25:08.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if the team with the disadvantage loses, they lose less LP than they normally would.
