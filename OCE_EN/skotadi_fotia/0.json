I am pretty sure it is not my internet or my hardwares&#039; problem. It usually occours during a kill, skill being shot out of a bush, warding in a bush, or seconds from being killed. I have been trying to fix this problem, but nothing have been very effective. Just wondering whether anyone have any suggestions that may fix this problem","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-08-27T04:51:38.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you please [run a client repair](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#wq6) for me, let me know if this helps.","replies":[]}]}
