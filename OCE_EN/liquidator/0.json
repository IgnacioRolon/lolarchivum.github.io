As a skilled cook, he enjoyed his works of cupcakes, caramel slices and amazing cheese cakes. Most days he came home to a joyous greeting of his two children and wife, until one day, a cold day, where his home felt like ice, it was dark, as though shadows had visited that day. Sure enough, as was found to be, one of Zed's pupils had wandered through the house, and in their pillage had been seen by his wife. In fear the student killed everyone in the house, leaving without an apparent trace, the markings left by the blades were evidence enough, and so, Tyeo dedicated his service to the protection of the state, changing his recipe from a satisfying taste, to something more, bitter sweet...\r\n\r\nPassive: enables all allies within a certain range to heal for 50% of the healing Tyeo has to himself\r\n\r\nQ: Cupcake throw; launches a cupcake slowing an enemy champ, deals extra damage to ninja based champs\r\n\r\nW: flour power: creates a cloud of flour, increasing movement speed and attack speed to all allied champs within area, and inhibits the ability of enemy champions seeing allied champions within the cloud\r\n\r\nE: slice (and dice); throws a slice of caramel slice, slicing through all enemy it hits (reduces damage per hit, 10% drop per hit, reducing to 40% minimum)\r\n\r\nR: Bake on (bacon): coats all allied champions in a chocolate covering, increasing all resistances and tenacity by 35% for 5 seconds\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nany thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-03-09T22:58:05.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"make him have positive interactive quotes with pantheon about being a baker\n\nps: love the idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Takiah","date":"2015-03-09T13:12:33.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always up-vote cakes!

But, he doesn't sound particularly interesting. I think it could be interesting to take some inspiration from FF IX's Quina, the blue mage. (She'd eat things and gain there abilities) it could be bloody interesting with a Cho-Gath like ult, and then that attack gets replaced with whatever ult the champion you ate had, except retains it's ability that it will change if you kill with it, (or if the Skill is not an agressive ability then changes on next kill) This is just a thought though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"meatwadsprite","date":"2015-03-07T07:48:35.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where is the donald trability?\nThe donkey consipirary?\n You lack even the tria condard. \nPlease.\n0/10\n=-=-=IGN","replies":[{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-03-08T13:10:03.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lololol","replies":[]}]}]}
