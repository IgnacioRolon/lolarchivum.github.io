That 0% shield and 0% speedboost seems too op. Tone it down a bit.. Just kidding. This sounds like a mix between Vayne, Quinn, Ekko, Vi, Velkoz and Bard all mixed into each one with nothing really changed.. Also look up how they come up with designs etc. Every aspect of the game is to move foward and away from ANTI-FUN which would be auras for example.. No one really appreciates the auras even if they are op. Just because it's boring..","replies":[{"poster":"Frisk","date":"2015-06-09T08:09:04.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm OK I kinda went with a new interesting things didn't realise i was mixing them together","replies":[]}]}]}
