I have never used any software or would never want to sabotage or destroy someone else&#039;s league of legends experience. I have put all my life savings into my account and i have never been banned after playing for 2 years. Any rioter who has a big heart can you please un ban me as i have tried to contact riot support and nobody is helping me i have been the best player i can be with no ban. If you want to ban me for the sake of it at least suspend my account for 2 weeks. I love this game i have put so much work into it and I need anyone who can help me out i have not used any such software this ban is not fair for someone who has never received one.
