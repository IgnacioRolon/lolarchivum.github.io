I have never used any software or would never want to sabotage or destroy someone else&#039;s league of legends experience. I have put all my life savings into my account and i have never been banned after playing for 2 years. Any rioter who has a big heart can you please un ban me as i have tried to contact riot support and nobody is helping me i have been the best player i can be with no ban. If you want to ban me for the sake of it at least suspend my account for 2 weeks. I love this game i have put so much work into it and I need anyone who can help me out i have not used any such software this ban is not fair for someone who has never received one. I am urging anyone from riot to please help me I am trying to contact riot support please look at my ticket for further details.\r\n\r\nKind regards.\r\nI know riot is known for their generosity and kindness with utmost respect I am asking out of sincerity I have not even received one chance and I haven&#039;t done anything wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Powerful","date":"2016-05-18T06:59:37.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"x Y","date":"2016-05-18T07:46:44.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still think they can un ban someone and i am not giving up i am going to keep emailing them until this is resolved nobody who has ever been banned before ever deserves a permanent ban go to the punishment section that's number 4.

Try and avoid spamming them with emails, one support ticket is enough and considering the high amount they receive it will not change how fast you get contacted, just try to put your mind at ease in the meanwhile. You and I are both under the notion that we did not break the rules but we had to of otherwise their system wouldn't of picked it up, neither of us are sure what caused it though. Your best option is to hold it out my friend.","replies":[{"poster":"x Y","date":"2016-05-18T07:55:40.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No i got the same thing 3rd party software no this is not just coincidence, not a single ban and I get permanent no that is not acceptable ill wait for a response from them still as i posted more in my ticket.

All permanent suspensions are apart of periodical 'ban waves,' this one is primarily focused on 3rd party software abusers, even if you do not use the software if there is absolutely any trace / remnants of it in your League of legends system files you will be punished as it is a direct violation of the terms of service but if you hold out and are genuinely innocent as you state Riot support should be able to assist you but it may take a few days due to the high influx of tickets.\n\n_Powerful,_","replies":[{"poster":"x Y","date":"2016-05-19T03:33:56.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What did you do? did someone go on your account?

Unauthorized access or compromise most likely refers to someone else accessing your account rather than whether their system detected third party software or not, your best choice is most likely to respond in a sincere manner asking whether your account will be reinstated as you believe you were falsely suspended.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"I Play Taliyah","date":"2016-05-18T06:01:33.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have also recived this perma ban.  i did use mkljogo for skins. after a 1 day bad i uninstalled imeadiatly and nkw i have a perma bad for these 3rd party programs. looking on riots support pages tho when an acount is perma baned it will not be opened again under any curcumstance","replies":[{"poster":"x Y","date":"2016-05-18T07:47:30.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still think they can un ban someone and i am not giving up i am going to keep emailing them until this is resolved nobody who has ever been banned before ever deserves a permanent ban go to the punishment section that's number 4.
