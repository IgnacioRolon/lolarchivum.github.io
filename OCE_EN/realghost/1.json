(Now I&#039;m not blaming them entirely for the loss)\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s very obvious (from my view) having vision is the best way to a) avoid ganks, b) control the map and objectives and c) ambush opponents.  Bad plays happen and I do them often so I&#039;m going to exclude this issues for now. What I&#039;d like to know is why the current supports (be they tanking braums, util blitz or ap lux&#039;s) they&#039;re just getting the first stage item of support items then going no further.  (Yes it&#039;s good if you&#039;re ahead - problem is we&#039;ve been behind most of those games)\r\n\r\nNow I know my first mistake is not picking up that they&#039;re not warding sooner. (and as I usually play jng tanks, I don&#039;t mind buying wards if we have an ap support) But I just don&#039;t get it.\r\n\r\nWards save lives and it used to be that it was almost always the second (or at least 3rd) built item.\r\n\r\nHelp me understand :(","replies":[{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2017-02-21T23:26:12.873+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they don't buy then u buy!

No exceptions.\n\nAlso the adc and sup's control wards, is fairly decent vision coverage earlygame, if you protect them from the enemy sup, throw a jungler's control ward in the dragon river bush and that's pretty decent vision control for laning phase. Support should buy the first upgrade for their gold income item first and maybe a cloth armour if botlane is getting hammered, not go straight for the sightstone.","replies":[{"poster":"RealGhost","date":"2017-03-01T20:38:08.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is exactly my view as well. There are times I forget to buy red wards (like I said I make mistakes too) but when I support I do exactly this, gold upgrade then sight stone + control ward (I usually ward between mid and blue in enemy jng or red and bot in enemy jng)\n\nBut lately I've noticed people like lux, sona, karma etc all getting frost queen and then just going straight ap. (In fact I saw an ap sona the other day that rekt my face off as malphite).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SupportWisp","date":"2017-02-22T07:59:59.175+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"exactly this, if the supp won't do it. you do it","replies":[{"poster":"RealGhost","date":"2017-02-26T10:20:08.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not answering the question.

I dont think a  trackers knife is affetice. Yes fair enough if a sup isnt warding then sure. problem is at level 4 you dont know theyre buying ap only. by that time its far easier to just buy the full sight stone. but this isnt answering my question though is it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-02-22T06:27:13.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"id rather protect from a gank than give up what i was doing to run to my tower like im the enemies jungler's bitch","replies":[]}]}
