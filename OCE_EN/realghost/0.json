I was playing Sion bot with Zed, and at one point Zed was in between minions and he got hooked. This was the start of the odd ball to come. Later I got hooked in a similar fashion, thinking there was a glitch, I tested it and baited another hook this time activating my shield. The hook was on the outskirt of my shield but managed to still hook me.\r\n\r\nCan you confirm if the hit box is actually meant to be that wide?  I could never have foreseen it to be almost double the size of the hook itself.\r\nAnd don&#039;t get me wrong he played extremely well, but it was the shield thing that has stumped me\r\n\r\nShot fellas.","replies":[{"poster":"Human Ryze","date":"2016-07-01T04:28:20.396+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its how he's meant to be played. His hook goes to your hitbox, if your hitbox overlaps that of a minion its possible to hook you from behind minions. - Youtube search \"Thresh Tips\" and watch some videos. Even if you don't play him, knowing his tricks will help you play against him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-14T09:03:51.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think his hook is fine from the games I've played with/against him lately. It's easy to be caught out with threshs hook, however due to his load up animation before throwing it out, makes it pretty obvious it's coming and gives ample time to react.\nBut like all hook champs, hit box size and reaction times aside I think you just need to respect the hook regardless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-07-01T01:16:46.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What skin did he have","replies":[{"poster":"RealGhost","date":"2016-08-14T08:15:20.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Championship","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-01T06:56:27.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main thing to note, is that Minion hitboxes are tiny as fuck, and champion hitboxes are significantly larger.","replies":[]}]}
