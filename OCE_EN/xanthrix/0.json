One day I was just clicking around in the client and I discovered that you can look at another players ENTIRE champion list (including mastery levels) by simply switching from their front profile page, very quickly,  to your own champions tab in your OWN profile. This will show you everything about that players champions. To recap here is the process in big, bold letters. THEIR PROFILE PAGE ----&gt; (very quickly) YOUR PROFILE FOLLOWED BY (again very quickly) YOUR CHAMPION TAB.\r\n\r\nWith that said and exposed to the world I have my own issue with this viewing system. I am an ADC main so I have a degree of pride with each rank 7 champion I earn. Yesterday I earned my 4th rank 7 ADC (Caitlyn {{champion:51}} if anybody cares) and now she has been thrown into oblivion with nobody to look at my achievement apart from people in game with me when I spam it 5 times a minute and those of you that stalk me and use my own trick on me. I think every player should just have their champion tab opened to everybody not only so that person can &#039;show off&#039; their achievements fully, but so other players can have a grasp of that persons champion pool.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-08-22T05:43:10.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh","replies":[{"poster":"Xanthrix","date":"2016-08-22T06:05:10.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really bro never played Janna?
