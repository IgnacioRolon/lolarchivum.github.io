New Meta ?","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I left league for about 2 years and decided you know what lets have another crack at this game. Queued for ranked (my first mistake) and got queued with some retard that decided to troll our game because no one wanted to dodge for him. Why he wanted someone to dodge? The other team had picked an Ekko and our troll didn&#039;t want to play his last promo against an Ekko.\r\n\r\nSO my question is, why do retards like him play the game? I thought the whole point of ranked was to play competitively to see who is better than the other. If you want to quit because you see someone on the other team who is playing a champion you struggle against, wouldn&#039;t you want to try to beat that champion so you can overcome your weakness ?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-13T12:14:04.714+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Some people tend to give up too easily, in the hopes that next game will be better, rather than struggle through a game they believe is already lost (which is only sometimes the case). I won't go too much into ranked attitude as I believe Yaia (our friendly neighbourhood instructor) is going to jump in. So I'm gonna focus on the player behaviour systems we have in place.\n\nTrolling/griefing/intentionally feeding/negative attitude are all reportable and punishable behaviours, and reporting them at the end of game is the best thing you can do. It's also a good plan to ignore them as engaging the behaviour tends to make it worse.\n\nI don't wanna go too in depth since your question was mostly about the attitude, but this is the behaviour considered reportable:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player#h1q1","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-04-15T07:22:20.915+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, defeatism is a big part of Ranked culture. Many players are all too keen to give up at the first sign or difficulty despite the attitude being unsustainable in the long run. If players knew that every game they gave up meant they'd have to win two just to get back to where they started (and if they  give up often who's to say they will win those) they'd probably try a little harder. \n\nI agree, all it takes is a slight change in mentality. Simply recognising those obstacles are challenges to overcome rather than inconveniences to be avoided is a great start to picking up some extra wins. If you're the kind of player who rarely gives up and believes in the comeback all the more power to you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-04-13T10:42:43.934+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Welcome back to hell. Nothing more to say really.\n\nThis season has gotten that much worse, but Riot refuse to do anything to fix it, that it makes it not worth trying to get any rank. Not only are there a fuckload of trolls, but the game play has gone up shit creek without a paddle.\n\nMy last 4 ranked games:\n1. I defend mid for about 15 minutes, get a score of 2/0, yet top and bot lane feed hard, no chance.\n2. I defend mid lane forever, top and bot wreck the enemy, we win without even trying.\n3. I grouped TWICE the whole game, got 2 double kills and only died because the enemy mid laner needed a babysitter.\n4. EVERY SINGLE TIME Zed attacked me I lagged and dropped about 20 frames... not fucking fun. Normally I wreck Zed, but this time due to the lagging I got stomped. I couldn't even react and defend myself.\n\nIt is the same shit every game, you get hackers, AFK's, trolls, or just shit players who can't defend against bots. Not ONCE this whole season in ranked have I had a game that I would call close. Maybe a game that lasted more than 20 minutes because 1 or 2 of us actually knew what to do and managed to delay the inevitable, but never a fair 5v5 game.\n\nIt has gone that much down hill I couldn't really care less anymore, Riot doesn't.","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-04-14T00:45:44.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"hackers.......?\n\nWrong game m8","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-04-14T02:41:41.369+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeh you obviously have not been here long enough.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Damocracy","date":"2016-04-14T08:28:35.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Living under a rock I see.
