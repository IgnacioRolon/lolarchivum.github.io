I don&#039;t know how or what happened, but they even changed my password and email address. I&#039;ve sent a support ticket to riot, but I was told by a friend to post on the boards so that a Rioter may see it too.\n\nI can answer any further questions upon request, I just want this dealt with, Im pretty annoyed someone was able to get a hold of my account without me ever giving out my password.","replies":[{"poster":"A Flying Brick","date":"2016-03-02T07:58:55.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As well as the ticket, I'd do all the scans you can on your pc to make sure there's no keyloggers or other malware that could of taken that info.\nAlso clear your browser history, including log ins and cookies (incase of a scam site).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-03-02T05:41:06.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"EDIT: Thanks, wasn't trying to be mean, just to convey urgency.","replies":[{"poster":"mexican0","date":"2016-03-02T06:00:11.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay done.

By posting that info on the boards anyone could send that to support claiming your account was theirs, hence the need to remove it quickly.\n\nGoing through support is still your best bet for account recovery, they may take a few days to get back to you though, depending on how busy they are. Sorry this happened to you, and please be patient, support will resolve this ASAP :)","replies":[{"poster":"mexican0","date":"2016-03-02T06:03:09.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand.
