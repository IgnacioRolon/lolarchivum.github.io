Some, for example taric, can be devastating in some situations, same as many of the other percieved lower tiered champions. I cant say just how many times ive played with a nautilus who ends up singley winning the game.\r\nAlso shows how many people are genuinely confused what champions are good and what are bad, and end up giving team comps that are plaed at even top tiers with womboteamfights adc supports top mid and jungler. Fun mode i find, little bit random, lot of fun.\r\n\r\nTl;dr, people can see the difference between perceived weakness and actual weakness. Grats riot. Now plez urf mode :)","replies":[{"poster":"Sacharissa","date":"2015-02-14T11:53:40.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know. there was a game I was given aatrox...ok, THANKS! \n\nthe fact is none of the champion is \"bad\", even a support can wreck if built enough AP. If you really want to screw up the other team in champion select, you could try 5 support? Five supports is actually deadly as they an stick together and heal each other all day long, but that requires some levels of teamwork that really doesn't exist in solo Q.  :D","replies":[{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-02-15T22:55:56.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I keep getting Janna or Nami, I'm really not sure why though. Janna with Mejais is pretty strong.

Everyone in the mode seems to think that support champions are trash. But almost all of them have an easy time going somewhere else and doing well.
