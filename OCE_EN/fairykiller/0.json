But we were losing and two players rage quit so it was 3v5 and we were losing significantly. So the the game had no chance of being even remotely enjoyable. Given the situation. I don't see why a 2 week penalty should be issued to me without penalizing the rage quitters. Furthermore I am new to the game so I not familiar with the subtle neunces of the ettiquette It seemed reasonable at the time to draw the game to quick conclusion. Although If this happened in the worlds, I think faker world have the presence of mind to play on regardless. Its not like this was a normal situation. I think the penalty in this situation was a bit harsh.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-10-21T12:11:50.209+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You would be amazed how many games are actually winnable.\nBut the people who quit, or surrender never find that out.  \nAnd it shows in their gameplay!\n\nBeing able to play into a losing game is a skill, one that many players are too impatient to learn.\n\nOne of my secret pleasures is when a someone rages at the team for being shit then leaves early in the game.  Those games spur me on to win just to spite them!  Something Swain says sums it up nicely I think; _\"I could kill them all, but it would be far crueler to show them that I am right.\"_  I love this mentality.  \n\nIt's so easy just to report someone and sulk about it, but a small penalty is nothing compared to looking back at your match history and seeing that 'Victory' you _knew_ was lost and chose to abandon, and in that moment realising that you mean NOTHING. Your team battled on in a 4v5 and won _because_ you weren't there. That truth hits harder than any chat ban.  And I love inflicting that upon those who leave.\n\n{{sticker:sg-syndra}} \n\nMy friend and I almost never surrender, so we know how to play into a losing game.  Our Azir/Ashe can feel like the movie 300 sometimes!  and of course we cant always bring it back from defeat _(especially as I've gotten progressively shitter at the game)_, but we make the enemy work damn hard for it!\n\nSo you shouldn't intentionally feed, because there are still players in the game that could be trying, and you never know!","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2019-10-22T06:42:11.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"My friend and I almost never surrender, so we know how to play into a losing game.

Primarily, that would be learning to play from behind, but really if there's any specific skills/mechanics that you find you struggle with (for example; last hitting, map awareness, positioning etc), this kind of situation is where you might try to develop that. Ultimately, a match is only a *total* loss if you let it be. If you find something to focus on, despite the state of the match, then at least there is still something you can gain from the experience.\n\nWhile *no* negative behaviours are encouraged, sometimes the best option in these kinds of situations is to just take a short break, even if it's the middle of a match. Go grab a drink or a snack and cool off a bit if you need to, and ultimately it's still a better option than feeding/throwing.","replies":[{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2019-10-21T02:55:52.131+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The amount of players leaving games and trolling from my personal experience has been terrible lately, sometimes just letting the game end is necessary.
