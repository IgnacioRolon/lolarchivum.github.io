I also want to improve at the game and one way I can do that is by versing highly skilled players where you find in a highly competitive environment.\r\n\r\nA bit about you: Im 19 years old played games all my life from Halo to call of duty. when i heard about e-sports I was instantly interested when I saw a game of LCS i feel in love with it. I always try my best especially in a team because i don&#039;t want to let my team mates down. I watch twitch follow LCK the most out of the all the regions. Got a licence. The thing i like to do the most is play league of legends. If i got a opportunity to prove myself I would be very thankful","replies":[]}
