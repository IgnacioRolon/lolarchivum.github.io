Makes gameplay terrible!\r\n\r\nEvery single game at least 50% of total summoners are bots.  I am reporting every time but I really hope there is something proper being done about it.  Just cheaters getting a free ride so they can be terrible at 30.  \r\n\r\nDear Riot, how many reports on a summoner does it take for you to ban their account? How many times do they need to pick 5 pairs of boots in ARAM to be banned?  How many Ghost/Snowballs?? Clearly there is a plain and simple formula that gets it past your defences, it is super obvious without watching them run headlong into turrets over and over and over again.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-11-23T16:47:45.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey maigraithe,\n\nWhile there isn't a specific numbers cap, each report is investigated and taken into account. At some point, accounts that have been deemed to be using 3rd party applications or botting will be permanently suspended in a ban wave. I'm sorry you're encountering these players, and if you ever want to play with someone that's not a bot, feel free to add me :) \nSummoner Name: Wuks (OCE) \n\nThanks for your diligence, and your reports are definitely appreciated in these cases.","replies":[]}]}
