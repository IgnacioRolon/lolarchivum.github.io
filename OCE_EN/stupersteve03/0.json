One of those games the guy rage quit because my team were using pings appropriately to give information. The game already recognises when this happens so why must it negatively impact on me? Just give me those games back, I&#039;ll play them again, just stop penalising me because some one on my team decides to leave.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-11-10T20:30:20.556+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mortis Ex","date":"2016-11-11T10:04:28.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rito just says suck it up and play hundreds of games and it will average out eventually and after you have played for years and suck thousands of dollars into a free game you might actually climb to the rank you are meant to be, having dealt with everything from Tyler1 toxic flaming ints to the \"gatekeeper faby\" mentality of people smurfing and tryharding when they see an opp in their series and trolling when on the same team. Unless rito actually takes more action against streamers and players like faby then lots of people think its just great fun to stomp on lower elos by smurfing and as accounts are free and rito changed the leveling system so its much faster and cheaper to get an acc to ranked play, smurfs and toxic behavior are going to increase rather than decrease. They arent scared of an acc being banned coz they have a couple and they didnt cost anything other than a little time.","replies":[]}]}
