Make your systems a bit more complex please, &quot;check if he has lost three in a row, check if he has 0lp, okay demote&quot; shows absolutely no nuance in the ranked system. I have previously been demoted (again in a new league) because I lost three in a row, two of which had leaver buster, busted, leavers in them. Your system can tell I had leavers but it doesn&#039;t even check for that when deciding to demote? I know I am bronze and it isn&#039;t really important, but it does really negatively impact my experience of the game and it does make me want to not play.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-08-04T00:06:53.957+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey StuperSteve03,\n\nI'm really sorry that you've been on a bad run recently with Leavers. We are working towards educating players more and more around appropriate player behaviour initiatives involving both rewarding and punishing players.\n\nIf you want to learn more about that head here - http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/L65wrRYe-player-behaviour-faq-updated-for-instant-feedback\n\nEven when you're going through a rough patch (I had one this weekend, rip) try to stay positive and focus on learning and getting better. Over many games leavers etc will balance out in your favour as long as you don't tilt.\n\nOnce again I feel you man, going through those situations really sucks. But I believe if you stay positive, and focus on learning you can make the climb!\nGL HF","replies":[{"poster":"Only Heimer","date":"2015-08-04T01:46:07.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":10,"body":"Yeah how about you actually answer the question.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-08-04T23:19:39.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He/She/It did answer the question.","replies":[{"poster":"Only Heimer","date":"2015-08-05T02:21:12.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no, he/she/it didn't.

If you dont understand what i mean when i say mmr, i mean match making rating its what ranks players and is what decides whether you should get demoted or not when you lose a game on 0 lp.\n\nIf you lose a game depending on how much mmr the other team had you will lose alot or a little mmr, and when you win a game depending on how much mmr they had you will gain a respective amount of mmr, this also plays its part when people skip elo's or tiers after winning alot of games in a row and beating promos.\n\nI hope that answers your question, if you have more just ask","replies":[{"poster":"Only Heimer","date":"2015-08-04T05:44:44.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"his question is why does the system NOT consider leavers when looking at the games you lost. it's quite a fair question. if the system can detect leavers and intentional leavers and then punish them for it, why can't it then consider those things when it looks at whether you should be demoted. as it stands it just simply sees that you lost, completely ignoring any big disadvantage you may have had. the reverse applies too. if you win many games in a row and skip a division, you don't really deserve that if several of those games had leavers/intentional feeders on the enemy team regardless of mmr.","replies":[{"poster":"Master Namer","date":"2015-08-04T23:52:26.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you will never be able to tell if people are 'intentionally' leaving games, therefore they have to be fair in the way they punish them incase they are just dcing or there are things that happen that are out of their control. Ofcourse there are people who intentionally leave and everyone, EVERYONE hates those people and im sure we have all had those experiences. Also it would be unfair to the team winning if they were to recieve less mmr/lp simply because they killed a enemy enough to make him rage quit, or if because of no fault on their own they dont get lp because someone dcd while they still played a quality game by their standards.\n\nYou have to give riot the benefit of the doubt, no matter how you look at it they are doing the best they can to keep in mind the benefit of the doubt concerning the players, also they need to find the balance inbetween punishments so that the good players with bad internet arent getting unfairly punished but just enough balance so that the players leaving get piunished enough that they will stop. They are catching people who are leaving though dont mistake that, i am sure 20minute que timers are doing work since i hated queing up and waiting 20 minutes.\n\n\nalso looking at your comment you need to keep in mind everyone gets dc's, to climb the ladder or not get demoted you just need to improve your skills enough to tip the odds of winning a game in your favour enough so that even with a dc or two every 10 or so games you still come out ahead positive in wins. \n\nBut ye, people can ruin league, i am sure there are many people in play/dia/masters/challenger just like me that have been demoted or lose a handful of games in a row all because of dc's\n","replies":[{"poster":"Only Heimer","date":"2015-08-05T01:51:53.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i actually meant to write \"leavers and intentional feeders\". \n\nim not saying that the winning team should necessarily not receive the normal mmr/lp but i do believe there should be some kind of \"handicap\" for the people on the losing side. nothing too drastic but perhaps a lesser loss of lp for losing if someone on your team has been disconnected or afk greater than a specific amount of time and/or a greater gain if they do manage to win 4v5, 3v5s etc. it gives a greater incentive to keep playing/trying and makes the game in general feel less toxic overall. at the very least they should make it that games don't start if someone has failed to connect/load.\n\nsure you can look at it from the point of view that everyone will get leavers in their games and therefore it \"all evens out\" in the long term. this approach seems way too passive to me. why not try to address it more aggressively in the short term for people and try to lessen the extent of \"(bad)luck\".\n\ncurrently if the system detects some kind of server instability it immediately loss prevents the game and the winning team receives a small lp gain even if it didn't actually affect the match at all, so i dont understand why they wouldn't want to do something similar for if and when people have been disconnected from the start or for a large portion of the game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
