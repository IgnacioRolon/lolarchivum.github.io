Like seriously, i just don&#039;t get how it&#039;s possible for players in this server to get matched up with at least one toxic player on average in every freakin game. Maybe not every game, but definitely majority (like around 90%). \r\nI&#039;d like to think i&#039;m a decent guy to play with ( got an honor badge to prove it XD) but when you&#039;ve played over a dozen games with salty guys in everyone of them, you&#039;ll definitely get stressed out and to some extent, depressed. I smoke almost 4 times as much when playing with guys that just wanna make the game shit for everyone.\r\n\r\nI guess what i&#039;d like to know is, how do you guys manage to put up with salties? I really could use the help because it&#039;s just not fun anymore for me.","replies":[]}
