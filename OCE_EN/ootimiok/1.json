I know I&#039;m no plat player but would like some good competition. \r\n\r\nSame shit. I win the first few games in their flex system and the next four I get feeders, afks, and purely new players who don&#039;t have a fn clue how to play. ok so I get stuck in bronze 2. \r\n\r\nI think whatever I was just unlucky and I&#039;ll just power on and get to silver quick. \r\n\r\nNot only do I get more trolls this time but I get pushed to B3 within a few more games from more afks, feeders and so fourth. Infact the only games I&#039;ve won are when the other side gets the afk, not us. What a joke.\r\n\r\nWtf have I done to deserve this riot, surely I can&#039;t suck that much? Has riot learnt from nothing in the last year to make games more even? How can it be that this year has the same lowbie scum to totally put me off playing ranked for yet another year. \r\n\r\nIt seems like the only way to play this game competitively at all, is to have a full premade. solo queue is totally screwed again. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m sure this is nothing new for everyone but its back to norms for me after being totally ripped off again this year.","replies":[{"poster":"Ootimiok","date":"2016-11-19T07:01:10.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"chewers for the advice, yeah I was tilted.

Have fun with your friends, learn to work together and climb as a group. \n\nOther than that, you can also continue to report the players that are ruining the game experience in the end of game screen. \n\nAlthough, I did look at your flex match history and find no evidence of intentional feeders, so I am just assuming you mean players with a large number of deaths that are having a bad game. Sometimes things happen, and the fact that you were placed in bronze means you are going to be in games with the most inconsistent players on the server, so this is going to be the norm on both your team and the enemy. Best thing is to keep your cool, don't point out their mistakes, encourage them and work on your own skills.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-11-18T12:06:30.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aye, there will always be feeders, afks and trolls, there will also be losing streak and winning streak.\n\nAs soon as you lost 2 games, you should have just stopped for an hour to avoid tilting and play later again when you feel great. I learned this the hard way and went from silver 1 to bronze 2 by playing on tilt.","replies":[]}]}
