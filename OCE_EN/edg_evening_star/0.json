But it's a bit suspicious that you would suddenly turn your morals around and want to right your wrong (after all, you had the initial motivation to do it in the first place). What's to prevent you from just hacking her account again and re-stealing all of the things you originally stole?\n\nAlso, if the gifts are returned by a red then your account will probably be banned for breaking the EULA. Not that a red would come to the board and read this, but are you aware that this is what might happen?\n\nThis is more philosophical than it is technical. I wish you the best of luck in righting your wrong, and hope that you remain on the path of righteousness.","replies":[]}]}
