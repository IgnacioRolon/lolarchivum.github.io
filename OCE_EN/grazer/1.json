I excitedly queued up for it, got into a champ select and then someone failed to ban and dodged. Instead of getting put back in queue, I was thrown back to the menu and Draft Normals had disappeared.\r\n\r\nWas it an error? Will Oceania FINALLY be seen as a real region? I&#039;ve been going on and on about Draft Normals for years and to see it enabled and then just as quickly taken away makes me sad... {{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"andyMak","date":"2016-03-04T03:19:08.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want this so bad...

But it is very sad, we have enough players asking for something, yet they won't offer it.\n\nIt is a double edged blade, with the low player base you can either not treat us like everyone else or take the risk, there is only 2 things that will happen, and I think they fear the later.\n\nFirst it can better the game, get more player joining and more playing. Second is that with the extra queues there will be less people in each and you know what goes with that.\n\nBut like Dominion, and soon to be TT, Riot will simply do nothing and let it fall apart to the point it can't be saved. Dominion was never looked at since all ranked and tournaments go through conquest, so they balance everything there, and I mean everything. The least they could have done is change how Dominion works to stop those dodgy tactics, it could have been done, there were viable ideas.\n\nSame goes for TT, players are either choosing whoever and sucking ass, or they are choosing assassins who have escapes and some form of CC, thus allowing them to simply wait and get an easy kill or run away and not die. There is no more team work in that queue, no more choosing someone like Garen, or Yi or Malz, it just no longer works.\n\nIf they don't do something about TT, that will go next. And it is the same with Draft Normals and low level Ranked. They need to fix them or they will become unviable and everything will just fall apart.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"lordofrage","date":"2016-03-03T05:19:15.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIOT U FUCKERS","replies":[]}]}
