I legit went and spent $100 for the new wow expansion and subscription again cause i just cant be fucked waiting that long to play a game, i mean i love lol but im not so addicted that im gonna wait that long to play a game.....\r\n\r\nlet me know how you feel about this in the comments section below, Personally i feel that they need a better method of AFK Deterrence.","replies":[{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-11-21T23:41:27.945+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't just get a flat out 20 lpq it takes a fair while to even work up a 5 minute lpq","replies":[{"poster":"Xpersha","date":"2016-11-22T02:19:37.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Knuuckles,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=IQ0WVmdE,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-11-21T23:41:27.945+0000)\n>\n> You don&#x27;t just get a flat out 20 lpq it takes a fair while to even work up a 5 minute lpq\n\nnah, it happened 2 games in a row. i think a while back i might have gotten a 5 minute LPQ, but this is a joke","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-11-21T23:20:41.601+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see no issue.

I love the game and i have over 5000+ games played with over $3000 spent on skins and shit and im just not waiting 20 minutes sitting in front of my computer doing nothing to wait for a queue to be popped to play a game. to then have to wait another 20 minutes for another queue, seems redundant to me","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-11-22T02:22:44.144+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> have you ever sat in front of your computer for 20 minutes to wait to get into a fucking queue just watching the lol client waiting to start the actual queue and then wait for a queue pop on top of that?\n\nNo. I've never been hit with an LPQ personally, but I have some friends who've been hit before and I did not just sit there staring at the client when I queued with them. There's plenty of things you could be doing while you wait for the LPQ to finish and start searching for a match.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-11-22T23:53:25.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the only time ive been hit with LPQ wasnt intentional afk, it was internet issues, it bieng stuck in the loading screen but because ping changing i cant tell wether im stuck in loading screen or not, or learning as a game starts i have to leave, never intentionally, but ive had a 20 LPQ before, not my fault","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-11-22T01:11:29.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know the feel, I rejoined a game (before minion spawned) cos the league crashed while in the loading screen and my team was doing a remake, assuming 3 people said no because I joined I accidentally clicked yes and it remaded, thing is that it still considered me AFK and gave me 5x 20minute lpq and I was super pissed cos like why?!  It wasn't my pc's fault, its the client bug. also this happened like 3-4 times already and I can't seem to make my lpq better cos there are chances my client will just crash or internet will turn off, and cause my lpq to be even worse, although its already at its worst. \n\nI hope they could implement a feature where if your team remakes and you joined afterwards, that your given a chance to explain why and also to have the client check whether if you intentionally quit the game after the remake time cap. But this is only the rough idea of how I would like it to be.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-11-22T23:54:26.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe increase the time before remake, until like 4 or 5 mins instead of 3","replies":[]}]}]}
