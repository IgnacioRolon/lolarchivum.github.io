When i tried to reload the client the game started patching for 15 minutes. When i finally patched and rejoined the game, We pulled it together and won the game. Afterwards it came up saying that leavebuster put me in a low priority queue (10 Minute Wait to get into a queue) (This was the firs time this had happened and that i left a game/Afked)\r\n\r\nI sent in a support ticket requesting that that low priority queue be removed from my account. and all i got back was a generic retarded ass excuse for a response from a ticket from any game i have ever played ever. Now ive played games with bad support teams... but i think riot takes the cake. They dont read your support tickets anymore, They simply just see the title, see what its about and reply too it with a pre-made message that raises more questions than it actually answers.\r\n\r\nhere&#039;s the response i got.\r\n&gt;  &quot;JEPROX Today at 00:52\r\n&gt; Hello Summoner,\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Your account was audited by our new LeaverBuster system. Due to a recent left game or AFK on your account, LeaverBuster has placed you into a low-priority queue.

I&#039;ve spent well over $3000 on this game over my time playing the game since season 1. When i send in a support ticket i expect to get atleast something of a humanoid response... but nope, riot cant afford to pay them apparently.....","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-23T01:45:31.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">$3000\n\nwut\n\nBut yeah, I personally think that they are red robots.","replies":[]}]}
