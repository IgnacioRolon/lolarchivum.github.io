Open Play\n2. Select Game Mode \n3. Select Role \n4. &lt;RIOT&#039;s Latency Checker&gt; \n* If Green, join queue\n* Yellow Join queue but throw message saying their ping \n* Red Prompt for confirm, show help about latency and how it occurs? \n* Or just show it on the side somewhere as your queuing, idk.\n\nI mean it gives players a good heads up that they are lagging before they go diving to a ranked and crying all match.","replies":[{"poster":"sK Spooky","date":"2017-12-04T04:57:08.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or just go to practice tool?","replies":[{"poster":"Argus Of Xenos","date":"2017-12-12T12:20:33.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's great for people who can be bothered, we shouldn't need to load in every time, as an end user it's a bad experience; just going to queue and giving them the warning should be more then enough for them to make a decision on the spot of queuing, pretty much removes lagging as a valid excuse.","replies":[]}]}]}
