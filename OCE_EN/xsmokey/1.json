As long as you cs more than your opponent you already have an edge, well not when you are playing strictly early game toons, since in that case kills matter too.","replies":[{"poster":"xSmokey","date":"2015-07-14T07:26:21.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand cs being a situational aspect of the game, though now I've just hit sliver V, to get that competitive edge on my lane opponent I figured id start to better myself in the finer aspects of the game.
