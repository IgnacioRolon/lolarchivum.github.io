I choose my champion which is Akali, and for some reason when I try to click on the &quot;Lock In&quot; button, it just turns grey and I&#039;m not able to lock in. So as soon as the count down went to 0, the client &quot;kicked&quot; me and gave me the 5 minute penalty that I show in the screenshot using Lightshot. Hopefully this doesn&#039;t count towards to anything bad on my account as it wasn&#039;t my fault at all, as the client wouldn&#039;t let me lock in at all.","replies":[{"poster":"star646","date":"2017-09-03T07:47:43.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It did the same thing to me but instead I can't login now for some reason!
