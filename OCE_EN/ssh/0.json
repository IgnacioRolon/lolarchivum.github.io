I have played over 500 games in order to get to Bronze 2. I know I&#039;m not the best but I was glad to fit into Bronze 2 and was 1 win away to becoming Bronze 1 finally. \r\n\r\nNow the new season has started, and even though I won 8 out of 10 games. I get placed back into Bronze 5. \r\n\r\nNow I realised Ranked games is not worth it any- more. It is not enjoyable.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-26T08:46:53.547+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there SSH,\n\nI understand how frustrating this can be, however it is normal.\n\nYour current (estimated) MMR is rather high for Bronze 5 (759) If you continue to play and win you have a high chance of skipping a division entirely and moving up to Bronze 3. It really isn't that hard to climb out of \"elo hell\" as some people call it.\n\nChin up :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"SSH","date":"2016-01-26T09:42:25.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, thank you for the comments and support. It just that I feel like I have wasted time and effort winning those games for nothing. What if i lost all those 8 games out of 10, will it still be the same result?  as in Bronze 5?  And it also feels like getting to Bronze 2 meant nothing since I have to win those promotional games all over again. But guess this is how Riot games work now, I can't help but feel a little bit cheated. Anyways thank you for the help.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-26T09:45:07.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You would've still ended up in bronze 5, however your MMR would've been _much_ lower, thus making climbing out of bronze 5 a lot harder.\n\nSee you on the rift.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-01-26T06:31:18.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just climb back again tbh, should be even easier this season. You mmr is more than likely higher than bronze 5 anyway.","replies":[]}]}
