I was on my smurf, level 8 (at the time of the game) account, and was fully expecting 1 or 2 smurfs on my team since i jumped straight to PvP on tht acc. \n\nTurns out this \"name removed\" couldn&#039;t get above level 3 by the time I was level 5- on-to-6 due to him being outjungled/not farming properly. He decided it was a good idea to force a gank on my lane. I was against a MF in top lane and she was a smurf as well ( I could tell cos she could kite, ward bush to grant vision to aa and could last hit ). He forced the gank, failed, but i managed to burn MF flash. All was good and cldve just ended there but he decide to tax my cannon wave that didnt even reach my minions yet and BROKE MY FREEZE that I was successfully setting up against a ranged champ as a melee champ in a long lane. For those who do not know, you have to this if not u wont survive in lane as melee vs ranged against a good player.\n\nI got pissed, ask him &quot;WHY&quot; and he replied with a :) and &#039;im level 3&quot; (aka he needs to steal my exp and gold). FIRST OFF, when someone is mad u dont reply with a cheeky :). SECOND, it is not your laner&#039;s fault if u were outjungled and behind and u should always ask, esp if ur laner is hving a hard match up.\n\nI continued asking why and told him that he did smthng wrong. He kept replying me with &quot;its just 3 minions&quot; (which is more than that if u read the above para) and &quot;stop typing just play&quot;. I could type as my laner left for mid for some reason and had free farm, hence i could multitask. BEST part was, he accused me of typing and being useless, but i did so much more than him (took FB tower, more farm, create pressure when our team had 0 cos they fed etc.), and furthermore, he was talking back to me, hence he was talking with equal frequency as me, making him a hypocrite.\n\nWhat disgusted me was that my team&#039;s mid cho gath sided this yi and said i was toxic, even though i had yet to launch any personal insults, feed or troll. This Cho was so convince that I was wrong, that he kept spam pinging me off my split push when I&#039;m tryn and my team is able to not fight a 4v5 as the opponent had no hard engage.\n\nOn top of that, the enemy Nami outright called me noob after my Yi complained to her in all chat. Turns out shes a hypocrite too, couldnt land a bubble on me, let me kill her twice when im 1/4/0 down and failed a flash epically. Her reason is that she is playing support Nami, so that excuses her misplays. Like what kind of shabby excuse is that. She was SO ADAMANT i was noob, even after i offered to 1v1 which she backed out of.\n\nWhat has this generation of league players turned into.......\n\n\nRIOT, please look into my game, especially the post game chat when \"name removed\" used an array of foul language and made racist remarks after being unable to take a loss after i basically revealed to him his hypocrisy.\n\n\nMy summoner is Biuwolf, the game was [game details]\n\nP.S. he asked for my address, said I needed to relearn english after I proved i had a better command of it than him, called me an asian gimp that eats dogs, insulted my family, asked for my address and told me that he would engage in homosexual intercourse with me in the postchat ;))))))))\n\n\nCall me a wimp, but all I can say is that, I want justice, and this is the way that harms him the least ;)\n\n\nI have screenshot evidence of the post game messages, I just dont know how to post them here","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-02-23T02:18:03.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It a troll, he is lv3 banning the account is no big loss.
