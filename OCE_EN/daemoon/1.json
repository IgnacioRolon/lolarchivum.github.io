The one thing that refuses to work is LoL.\n\nI can open the patcher fine, and get to the log-in screen. But once I try and log on, I get an extremely slow server authentication message, then after a couple minutes of \"logging on\" it stops and tells me there is a connection error.\n\nAnyone have any idea as to what the problem is/a likely method to fix it?\n\nAlso, why don't we have a tech board yet? Seems like a pretty logical thing to add.\n\nThanks\n\nEdit: Currently I've been \"logging on' for 10mins...
