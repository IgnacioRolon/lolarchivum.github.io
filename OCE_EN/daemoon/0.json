It's not really anything to do with relation to Riot allowing it to slip past.\n\nI have run tournaments in the past and I know that sometimes there will be the same high level players compete and ultimately win each tournament. This doesn't work very well on giving new or lower ranked players competitive experience and an honest chance at playing a few rounds.\n\nThis is labelled as an amateur tournaments, so they are wanting to give those lower ranked players a go at gaining some much needed experience, which helps the region grow as it can increase the number of skilled players.\n\nHope this helps.","replies":[{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-05-27T23:40:52.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is  awesome point and i believe every word said here is true but id like to add on that maybe (like pancake said) add a tournament where its bronze vs bronze silver v silver etc. that would be really fun, and maybe the higher the elo the bigger the prize.

People will need to make teams with people they know in the same elo (silver people may frequently play with friends in gold but won't be allowed for this tournament), it may also limit the amount of people entering the tournament.\n\nIt's a good idea and the thing is, there is nothing stopping anyone who has these ideas from organising a tournament themselves :)","replies":[{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-05-28T04:29:57.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but a person with these idea also needs the place, money and time to run these things and they are all things i don't have :c but it would be awesome to increase the competitive scene in OCE and also give bronze/silver/ gold players the confidence to get better and to also have a chance :D","replies":[{"poster":"LemonHunter","date":"2015-05-28T04:36:35.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For a physical tournament, yes it is quite a bit harder.

Great.\nBut does winning a few solo que games make you a pro? I don't think so. You'll find most solo que players are amateurs in 5s.\n\nAnd flip it the other way, lets say they decided bronze players weren't welcome because they don't want to waste anyones time/have \"better\"  games.\nPlenty of people would be upset by that.\n\nIts an invitational, so discretion can/will be used in deciding which teams will play can be used. If a team on paper looks amazingly good/not in the spirit of the competiton by being full of challenger solo que players with experience in ranked 5s too then they could perhaps decide another team is a better fit.\n\nBut as it is now, its just... I have a hard trouble decribing it without bad mouthing whoever's in charge.\n\nEdit:  Quick note, this is hardly effective when you think about smurfing. You can't really confirm if someone has another account at a higher MMR nor is assuming people are smurfs because they play particularly well anything less than the height of stupidity.","replies":[]}]}
