Japanese Darius sounds terrible, as does Spanish Heimerdinger. \r\n\r\nI also miss French Rammus, he makes me feel so inexplicably uncomfortable. It was great.\r\n\r\nI know it&#039;s alot of work for Riot to even consider letting us have this, but I miss it and I&#039;m sure some of us miss it too.","replies":[]}
