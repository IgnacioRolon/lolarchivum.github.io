I&#039;ve considered letting my friends borrow the account and just ask them to grind 1 normal game a week but I reconsidered since a few times they&#039;ve shared accounts, they got each other banned and since alot of them would probably troll, go full ap garen mid in ranked (or some of my nicer friends might try to boost me and I don&#039;t want to be boosted I like being where I belong) or be toxic and I&#039;d rather not risk getting banned (I&#039;m also not sure riot would like it if I let another player use my account temporarily, even if only for normal games).\r\n\r\nMy main query is whether it is possible to simply play on the oce server from the uk? Would I just have to deal with ~300 ping? Would it not let me? Would I get banned for playing a few of normal games on my bronze account from another server? Would I be fine so long as I didn&#039;t do ranked? Should I get better friends? Should I just try to forget about league and just enjoy the holiday?\r\nI&#039;m just not sure of anything.\r\n\r\nAlot of older forum posts on this matter (circa 2013) say there is no issue and I would just have to deal with high ping (and I don&#039;t think high ping would make much of a difference for me since i started playing with a horrible internet connection and around 350 ping and I haven&#039;t improved since getting better internet), so...).\r\n\r\nThanks for the help.","replies":[]}
