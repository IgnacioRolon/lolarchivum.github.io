I just think that getting a champion shard from an honour capsule is like &#039;why bother?&#039;. Like a skin shard, a ward skin, a summoner icon. Yep those are awesome. A soraka champ shard? Why even bother getting my hopes up. I like the idea of a reward incentive but if the reward is this... then just don&#039;t bother. \n\nhttps://ibb.co/g3wn4v\n\nLike why bother?\nI&#039;d have been more satisfied with a popup that just said, &#039;GJ for not being an asshat and being friendly to your teammates&#039;.\n\nAlso what did you guys get from the honour capsules?","replies":[]}
