What are going to be your secret top tier picks?\nMy picks are below.\n\n----\n----\n\nI forsee these champions becoming more prominent in the adc role\n{{champion:74}} good poke, can push and kill turrets fast and very safe when paired with a tanky cc sup \n{{champion:117}} decent base damage, atk speed buff for killing turrets and good defensive abilities against assassins \n{{champion:6}} maybe with a triforce into lastwhisper to deal with tanks, good early damage and can take towers decently fast and has tools to deal with assassins.\n{{champion:17}} has always been a marksman and a troll adc pick but his early damage is certainly there and some of the more atk speed oriented builds can certainly rush towers.\n{{champion:53}} I&#039;m not sure what happened but I&#039;ve had some great games playing this guy with a full ad build with a hydra and with the cast windups for some mages this might become unusually viable. Also if built right, ad blitz kills towers so much faster than you would expect with 60% atkspeed from w and e doubling his ad and reseting his aa timer.\n\n\nAnd in the support role these might become more popular\n{{champion:36}} targons into a spirit visage rush and most ap mages are not going to have fun and you help push towers fast with e.\n{{champion:427}} taking exhaust and smite but not as a jungler. Mages roam alot and this guy would probably help alot especially if on the way to ganking mid he could steal blues for the botlane mage and he offers a shield and a root which would work really well with alot of the expected botlane mage picks such as ziggs, victor and zyra.\n{{champion:25}} already a support, but if botlane mages become a thing, black shield is obviously going to become more popular. Also roots work well with most botlane mages like victor.\n{{champion:30}} this guys &#039;wall of pain&#039; lowers magic resist and slows which would be very very cost effective in a duo mage botlane, karthus also likes to build rylias simply for the slow which won&#039;t be nerfed for him and he has decent base damages and his ult will help him pick up gold across the map and he can also play super aggressive in the hopes of getting kills in exchange for his life using his passive.\n\n{{champion:3}} against two mages this guy can just stack magic resist for days and basically force the enemy jungle to camp bot and if it's also an ap jungler, then rip, you should try to have better balanced teamcomps in future then.\n\n---\n---\n\nSo what are your thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Mortis Ex","date":"2017-01-09T03:40:03.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One thing that I feel you didnt take into account with Ziggs as bot is his reliable and controllable wave clear and cc/zoning. \nHe has self peel which is one of the biggest problems with a lot of adcs atm. He can clear a wave pretty much instantly with his Q+E but doesnt auto push. And arguably the most important besides tower damage is his long range. \n\nTeemo suffers in most bot matchups due to his short range but he can destroy Vayne like its not even funny. He gets screwed by almost every mage so if mages become dominant I dont think he will.\nLulu does have peel but machine gun Lulu just isnt as effective as other builds for her so im not sure it would work. She works top lane as a lane bully denying someone like Darius that cannot get into range and if he flashes she can just poly him and run.\nHeimer is so zone reliant, short range, and has trouble with wave manipulation. \nUrgot is an ad caster and short ranged with no real escape and his R stops him from doing anything and swaps places which is often not ideal as an adc. Like Caits R stops her from doing anything but its range is like 10x Urgots R. \n\nKarthus is already seeing some play as a sup with long range, wide area slow and consistent dps which doest stop with death giving the enemy a hard choice between killing him or adc first. \nMorgana I think you are totally right, if mages become more popular her kit is designed to screw them over. \nMundo is interesting but doesnt offer a huge deal apart from being a meat shield. Most tanky sups have better cc.\nIvern I have seen bot a couple times, he has a strong kit and the ability to \"blind\" enemies by creating a bush to block vision is nice and he has a lockdown/ gapcloser and has some utility in Daisy.\nGalio is another interesting one with his aoe damage and ability to rush into enemy and R multiple opponents plus his shield sustain in lane. \n\nA few you didnt mention are Cassy, Karma, Swain, Maokai, Veigar and Velkoz. They all offer strong peel and damage. \nAnd maybe some surprise ad melee supports like Garen who is one of the best meatshields in the game and can regen his hp fairly quickly, has silence and arm shred and execute, Pantheon with some poke and a stun with big threat of crits if low hp and can gank other lanes effectively with his R, J4 for his knockup and dunk threat.\nSion, Malph and Poppy are already seen as sup semi regularly for their tank, cc and high base damage.\n\nIf ranged mages do start to dominate the bot lane I wonder how that will start effecting other lanes meta. AD mids seem to be in a terrible place atm so will this mean top and jungler will be forced to play ad champs to avoid mr stacking?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hideousbeast","date":"2017-01-08T09:28:16.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:74}} Botlane is really good but he has his drawbacks.\n\nFor example, if he is laning against either a {{champion:202}} or a {{champion:222}} he will get royally screwed over. Both have too much range, too much AOE damage (Dancing Grenade and Fishbones respectively), and long range ults that give old mate Heim' grief.\n\nHe also teams horribly with some champs, mostly supports that peel (funnily enough). Supports like {{champion:12}} , {{champion:89}} and {{champion:44}}  are all ineffective with {{champion:74}} because he lacks the ability to DPS without his turrets, and needs a clear view for his rockets to hit his target.\n\nOn the other hand, he fairly well bullies most other ADC's, though {{champion:51}} can be a challenge if she knows what she is doing. (Headshot the turrets)\n\nSome of the best Supports to Heim that I have enjoy are the ones that can bring the opponent into turret range. {{champion:53}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:25}} and {{champion:27}}. \n\nIn a nutshell, if you can get Jinx and Jhin banned, Heim will hold his own, if not dominate, botlane with an effective support.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-08T23:25:10.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I was thinking more thresh, tahm kench or nautilus and not alistair and others oops. I know heimderdinger is hard to play into jihn, jinx or cait and actually most other adcs but he's decent against mages and can hold off most of their push and is pretty good defensively, especially if the enemy teamcomp doesn't have ranged dps like adcs that can quickly destroy his turrets in the lategame.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-01-07T00:32:19.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"theres a few on the list that arn't really apc's but ok\n\nimho{{champion:6}}  has alot of unseen potential when built and played right. my current build i run botlane {{item:3004}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3812}} {{item:3046}}  or sometimes {{item:3087}} . and depending on different variables i swap out an item for {{item:3071}} \n\ni enjoy playing {{champion:90}} hybrid when i cant be fucked playing an adc you can farm a whole wave of minions by using e+w+w once.\n","replies":[]}]}
