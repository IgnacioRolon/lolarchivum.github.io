Dark harvest only did 66 base + 242 soul essence + 40 (25% of 158 bonus ad), physical damage. \n\nDark harvest does so much damage over the course of the game since it's basically extra damage whenever you attack an enemy, whereas thunderlords has a cooldown but does more damage earlier into the game, and doesn't need to be stacked.\n\nActually the more I think about it, dark harvest needs less base damage, making it into more of a scaling rune.\n\nAnyway I got the damage by throwing e before I auto'd, and then auto'd and hydra'd before the e landed, for a near instant one-shot.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-11-26T15:13:39.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i know. making a point on darkharvest damage tho","replies":[]}]}]}]}
