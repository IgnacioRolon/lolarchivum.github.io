If this account gets banned for this one offence, I'm probably going to quit, because I refuse to play a game where being abusive is ok, but standing up for yourself, is not.","replies":[{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2018-09-25T23:44:43.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't understand why you got abused when you are 10 3 up!

I don't condone the behaviour, but realistically I think it's a bit ridiculous to expect every player to legitimately try to win a game when they're being abused and told they should AFK by all 4 of their team mates.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-09-26T08:22:54.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't afk in the sense of leaving the game, i just split push (even if i'm not on a champ that should split) until the game ends, either i win while my team ints while i'm free taking objectives, or i lose, because my team ints and i don't care enough about toxic people to bother helping them\n\nCan't get banned if you do nothing wrong\n\nPersonally if they say afk, i think you should but not from the game, rather just from the team, just farm jg or split push side lanes (just make sure you're warding enough so you don't also int) or Frag where you can (out of position adc etc.)","replies":[]}]}
