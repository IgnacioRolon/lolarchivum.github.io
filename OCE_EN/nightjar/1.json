My favourite support champs are zilean, janna and braum though I can play a range of supports depending on my adc, teamcomp, team select requests and the matchup. I played the first of those 10 placement matches with my friends who are in silver and we lost.\r\nAnyways I went on and kept doing placement matches solo, I went 6/4 including that first loss and somehow I got put in silver 3 (I blame you riot).\r\n\r\nNow I can&#039;t cope and I&#039;m feeding and I feel so boosted I can&#039;t handle this elo. Also it&#039;s making my plat friend really mad since he&#039;s sure I should be bronze 5; though at least nobody has flamed me in ranked for being bad, though in my placements we had an ekko who was a little upset when I mistimed my ult a few times but he was still pretty tolerant and I was the one making mistakes and he calmed down after and was nice so honour to him. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s because I&#039;m playing passive champions and getting carried but I&#039;m not losing lp and I need to drop because I can&#039;t handle this elo it&#039;s too much. I feel like I&#039;m dragging my team down and I almost made someone lose their promos since I wasn&#039;t really helpful and was basically just a glorified moving sightstone and red trinket.\r\n\r\nIf you look at my match history you&#039;ll see I&#039;m not good enough to be silver since I never ever carry whereas a real silver player would carry from time to time. My damage is also never highest even though ap support is supposed to poke hard and eventually do the most damage through building cdr and using their high base damages. I try peel and to build team aura items like locket of iron solari and michaels and zekes whilst still keeping up with the core items I need to do relevant damage or tank damage but I&#039;m still not really helping my team enough. I recently started to take ignite because my plat friend suggested it&#039;s better for low pressure supports like janna and zilean but sometimes I still take exhaust against attack speed adcs and I kinda prefer exhaust but maybe that&#039;s just my bronze-ness kicking in.\r\n\r\nCan I get some advice on how I can quickly get to bronze where I belong that doesn&#039;t involve intentional feeding and trolling (though some games I can barely tell the different between my score and an intentional feeder) and I don&#039;t want to be a negative member of the league community and get banned. I also don&#039;t want the silver border since then people will expect me to be decent at league but I&#039;m not. Should I just make a new account?","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-09-18T12:12:30.116+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, you play very supporty supports. Its kinda of hard to tell how hard your \"carrying\" since its more about how well you do your job more than damage done, k/d/a etc etc.\n\nfrom your K/D/A theres nothing wrong with you at all. You have a crazy good KDA on ZIl and Janna.\n\nThe only problem i see is your lack of Pink ward buying. you have many 40+ min games where you've only bought 1 pink.\nAlso your Zilean Support build is rather questionable. Building a Rod of Ages on a support is just a no no in my book. You also prob due a little too much on Zilean, having more than 5 deaths on average isn't that good.\n\nBut your stats say you are Silver player (to me).\n\nalso Exh > Ignite in most situations.\n\nJust play more. Everyone ends up where they deserve eventually. You can judge whether or not you deserve your rating after you play 50 or so games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-09-19T06:34:39.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mate, don't feel like your boosted regardless whether your plat friend says you should be. \nKeep playing norm and keep improving yourself within that elo, the more you learn from your mistakes and how your fellow players play then you will sure to learn from it and soon enough you will be truly in silver 3. \nI also learned from my mistakes and now I know how much I've improved from where I were used to be.\n\nMaking yourself feel boosted and convince yourself that your bronze will only hinder you from improving. If you see how other people are so much better than you then you know you have so much to learn which is good because if your at your limit you will probably just stay there. \n\nBut fore sure just be prepared to be flamed at cos people will take rank very seriously , just play really well in norm and once your ready then enter rank.\n\nAlso ignite is good when countering heal, exhaust is good but reduces some amount of AD and reduces 40% attack speed.\n\nAdd me if you need some positivity and any support you need {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Qoki","date":"2016-09-18T15:47:02.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chill mate. If you feel tilted, or pissed off just take a break, play some ARAMs or do something else other than worrying about league.\n\nNever stress about not having the highest damage on your team as a support player , like sure if you're a  glass cannon \"support\" AP mage who lives by the motto that  \"death is the best peel\"  you'll have good damage stats, but for most team-focused supports you'll barely damage as much as the jungler.  Plenty of support mains have climbed on a lot of the more team focused supports so don't worry about the damage stats, worry more about how much vision you're providing and making sure your team doesn't feed out the ass (that applies to you also xd). Like your job as support is to make your team look good, and to do that you need to have vision to make picks, not die stupidly and get objectives - that normally doesn't correspond to a sexy KDA or damage chart but if you win who gives a shit.\n\nDon't put yourself down, and honestly if you feel challenged that should be a good thing. Just try to think about how things went down each game (especially if you think you played like shit), and work from there. Anyways good luck and don't be so hard on yourself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-09-18T11:42:09.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same problem.
