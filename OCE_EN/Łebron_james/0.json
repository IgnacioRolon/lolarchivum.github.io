Typically punishments follow tiers, with two chat restriction, then 14 day ban, then perma ban, however chat offences considered especially severe (hate speech, kys etc) do escalate straight to 14 day.\n\nAssuming this log is complete and unedited and you have had no prior punishments then I would recommend submitting an appeal ticket to player support, and they will likely either reduce or revoke the punishment since you were just quoting someone else and there doesn't appear to be malicious intent behind the 'kys' which would have been what got you escalated.\n\nIf you did have prior punishments, this still seems pretty tame and you'd have to have a significant history of reports and negativity for this to net you a punishment, which support can provide you with if that is the case.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-01-08T11:02:56.582+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=vTPAoJ6L,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-01-08T10:45:41.461+0000)\n>\n> Typically punishments follow tiers, with two chat restriction, then 14 day ban, then perma ban, however chat offences considered especially severe (hate speech, kys etc) do escalate straight to 14 day.\n\nhe said KYS in chat so he would have absolutely skipped tiers.\n\nBut the context of KYS is absolutely not worthy of a ban.\n\nAnd on we go with why the system is so shit at the moment.\n\n\"you must have deserved it\". \"there are tiers so this is obviously not your first time\".

Of those that have posted logs, I have seen only one (this one) that is actually undeserving, which leads me to believe that is either isn't happening very often, or that they are being handled properly by support in a timely manner when they do happen, or some combination thereof.\n\nI'm under no delusions that a no tolerance policy won't catch some innocents or mostly innocents in the crossfire, I just don't see it happening all that often. How often do people actually quote something like that back or mistype it after all? You say you've been stung by the bot, but by your own admission you told someone to neck themselves, yet you seem to agree that serious offences warrant escalation which is what confuses me.\n\nI disagree that the system is broken. I don't believe it's perfect, and I agree with you completely on some things which I reflect in my votes, but I don't believe it's broken (at least as far as chat is concerned), especially if the alternative is to do little or nothing about hate speech etc.\n\nAs for derision...I admit I have been harsher than appropriate with my responses at times, but that usually isn't to you. You have some opinions that baffle me, and some that make total sense to me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ŁeBron James","date":"2018-01-08T11:15:36.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree\nthe 3 teammates in my team also said kys even doe i never said it back to them and i still get banned","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-08T11:30:10.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"No system is perfect, especially when harsh stances are taken.
