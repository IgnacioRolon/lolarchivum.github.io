Every Champion is \"OP\" when 1. fed or 2. In the hands of a skilled player. \n\nBut you have to admit that it is another \"Nid-a-pedo\" (patch 4.10) buff gone wrong. Here is why, at level 5 the new Mordie has level 3 \"Ace of Spades\" now if Mordie has 0 offensive masteries and 0 runes, he has 76 attack damage and it is bonus magic damage on auto attacks. that ends up being:\n 76 + 76 +76 = 228 ad\nNow the scale ratio is 27.5% ad at level 3 \"Ace of Spades\" with a multiplier of 2.5 per hit on magic damage, that ends up by my math.\n76  x 0.275= 20.9. \n20.9 x 2.5= 52.25.\n52.25 x 2.5= 130.62.\nThen you have the base magic damage of level 3 \"Ace of Spades\" to add ( it is 12 magic damage) which ends up at.\n12 x 2.5= 30.\n30 x 2.5 = 75.\n\nSo the end result of Mordie with no masteries nor runes landing all 3 hits with \"Ace of Spades\" is.\n228 + 20 + 52 + 130 + 12 + 30 + 75 = **547** total \"hybrid damage\" before resistance\n\nNow I'm no challenger but that is pretty damn strong for a level 5 with only one of the champions moves. Especially since the average \"Hit Points\" of a champion at level 5 is  around 812. Add a level 2 ( if the player doesn't chose to level Harvester of Sorrow\") \"Siphon of Destruction\" on that baby that's another 110 (667 total) and a Ignite ( 150 True damage) that brings you up to 817. A whole 5 points above the Average champions \"Hit Points\" in the mater of (0.641868 attack speed at level 5 + 5 seconds for smite) 7 seconds at most. \n\n\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nPro games are not played wth this patch (5.14 is played)  as of yet and we are only a few games till pre worlds break. Patch 5.18 will be played at worlds.\n\nMordie has 817 ( no runes nor masteries) damage at lvl 5 with ignite, average champion HP is 812. Simply op.\n\nThanks,\n\nP o I\n\nEdit: \n\nP.S: I see what you did there{{champion:64}}  Ammonia, loled my @$$ off.","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-09-06T13:29:43.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tldr","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-09-04T23:04:08.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but who in their right mind would max q first on mordekaiser?","replies":[{"poster":"Powha of Ice","date":"2015-09-04T23:07:45.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any one with {{summoner:4}} after all its a new champion kit, means new play styles and its been 16 days since 4.16 so wait for it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ammonia","date":"2015-09-05T02:06:38.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Btw this game is not about all the pros there are casual peoples like me who play ranked games or normal games, i love off meta stuff but man mord is so unbalance with so much sustain and very high damage","replies":[]},{"poster":"LogiOCE","date":"2015-09-04T13:21:11.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"brilliant xD","replies":[]}]}
