(vulgar language due to frustration)","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"First off. im going to apoligise for the vulgar language. but im honestly fed up with this. please read.\r\n\r\nWhen are you nerfing darius. for real. no fucking champion should be able to one shot people while being A FUCKING TANK. ALL IT TAKES IS TO BE MISS STEPED INTO HIS RANGE AND YOU ARE GONE. RIOT I LOVE YOUR GAME BUT IM SO GOD DAMN SICK OF JUMPING INTO A GAME SEEING A DARIUS AND JUST BEING FORCED TO PLAY LIKE A BITCH FOR THE REST OF THE GAME CAUSE I KNOW THERE IS SOME PSYCHOPATH ON THE OTHER END OF THAT COMPUTER READY TO ONE SHOT ME. I UNDERSTAND THAT DARIUS IS WEAK TO KITING. BUT THAT IS ONE WEAKNESS. ONE. HE HAS ALMOST NO OTHER WEAKNESSES. AND IN A META WHERE ADC&#039;S (The main champions that kite) ARE DYING. DARIUS IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE UNHEALTHY. LOOK AT HIS KIT. THOROUGHLY. IT IS OVERLOADED BEYOND BELIEF. \r\n\r\nA PASSIVE THAT BLEEDS ENEMIES FOR A RIDICULOUS AMOUNT. UPON APPLYING FULL HEMORRHAGE STACKS TO SOMEONE OR KILLS THEM WITH NOXIAN GULLITONIE. HE APPLIES THE FULL STACKS BY HITTING ANYONE ONCE. FUCKING ONCE. AND TO TOP THIS ALL OFF HE GETS UPTO 200 FUCKING AD. WHY. AND THIS IS JUST A PASSIVE.\r\n\r\nHIS Q. AN AOE CIRCLE THAT CAN DEAL UPTO 140% FUCKING  TOTAL AD PLUS A MAX OF 160 BASE DAMAGE. AND CAN HEAL HIM FOR A MAXIMUM OF 36% MISSING HEALTH. THE MANA COST ISNT EVEN BAD FOR THIS EITHER. the only fair part about this ability is the reduced to 35% damage if they are inside the radius.\r\n\r\nHis w i guess inst to bad. 40% ad ratio bonus on his next auto plus and auto attack reset.. killing a unit with refunds mana and halfs cooldown. this ability is fun. BUT. the slow is a little fucking stupid. 90%.. granted for 1 second. but 90%! slows above 80% might as well be a root. honestly its like not moving at all. but anyway. im ok with darius w to an extent.\r\n\r\nHis e. a deceivingly long ranged 450 unit pull. along with 25% armor penatration. and applies a 40% slow for 1 second after pull. this is annoying but not bad. like his w combined with the rest of his kit this because just not ok.\r\n\r\nnow comes his ult. his. fucking ult. with a 460 unti dash range (longer than his e) darius deals 100/200/300 (75% bonus ad) true damage to a champion.HOW EVER. WITH 5 STACKS OF HIS PASSIVE. HE WILL DEAL 100% INCREASED DAMAGE. MEANING HE CAN DEAL ALOT OF FUCKING DAMAGE. LOOK AT HIS PASSIVE AND THEN LOOK AT HIS ULT. THESE TO COMBINED ARE FUCKED. AND AT RANK 3. ITS COST NO MANA. AN EXECUTE ULTIMATE THAT COST NO FUCKING MANA. AS WELL AS IF IT KILLS SOMEONE ITS COOLDOWN IS RESET. FUCKING WHY.\r\n\r\nHONESTLY RIOT. THIS CHAMPION IS FUCKED. EVER SINCE THE REWORK. AND UP UNTILL PATCH 7.3 YOU HAD NOT PERFORMED ANY BALANCE CHANGES TO HIM SINCE 5.20! AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE SINCE THEN. FIXED A FEW BUGS AND LOWERED HIS EARLY BASE AD HE GETS OFF HIS PASSIVE. BOY THAT SURE DID IT DIDNT IT. THAT MAKES HIM REALLY FAIR NOW. GO BACK TO THE OLD DARIUS. YOU KNOW. THAT NOT OVERLOADED BULLSHIT KIT. SURELY IM NOT THE ONLY THAT IS COMPLAING ABOUT DARIUS TO YOU. LISTEN TO THIS RIOT. \r\n\r\nDARIUS\r\nIS\r\nNOT\r\nHEALTHY\r\n\r\n- A very devoted fan that just wants to have a fun and fair game when this certain champion is in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-02-16T11:42:26.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lets be real here the majority of champions in this game are unhealthy","replies":[{"poster":"1989 Holden Nova","date":"2017-02-16T21:23:33.245+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very true.
