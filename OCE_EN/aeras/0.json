This has recently occurred to me, where i have been \"Dooped\" Into gifting someone a mystery Champ with the full mindset of getting a champ in return, and of course I was unfriended and left without my 475 RP. Implementing a system where two summoners can trade without the fear of this occurring should be imminent. \n\nOne way that this could work is to have both the summoners select an option of choice eg. Mystery Champ Trade, both summoners appear in some sort of lobby where they will both purchase the Mystery Champs temporarily, and until both summoners purchase the skins the trade will not occur. This Event could have a timer set to 3 mins for example, so that you don't end up getting trolled.\n\nTherefore no-one loses any RP and does not end up feeling like me.","replies":[{"poster":"aeras","date":"2015-01-16T08:43:08.762+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if people can avoid this type of fraud by just trading with people who you know and trust in Reality, Why no have a system where two players can trade gifts?
