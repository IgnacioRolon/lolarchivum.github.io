As an avid Rengar player, i find it both hilarious and  very very, entertaining.  Riot did acknowledge that the rework didn&#039;t at all help this cause, they are currently looking into ways they can further change Rengar to bring more counter-play and more options for Rengar to Assassinate his enemies. \n\nPersonally, i like the way Rengar is right now, i didn&#039;t at first, but i grew to love it. Ultimately what i think is wrong with Rengar is that he has lost his true identity over the years of his release, from being a Beastly Headhunter to becoming a fly by suicide bomber. I don&#039;t think Rengar needs minor changes i think that he need a complete rework. Riot are hopping around the bush completely ignoring this very fact. Rengar is unhealthy. \n\nI have a couple of ideas that i would like to see if he is to get a complete rework. Firstly i would like to see Rengar become more of a Headhunter/Territorial/King of the Jungle type champion where his Bone Tooth Necklace plays a larger role in his game-play vs just giving him stats. I was thinking maybe when Rengar kills an enemy champion, the area where he killed them now becomes Rengar's territory and it&#039;s marked in someway perhaps with the head of the enemy on a stake, this territory now gives Rengar buffs like movement speed/attack speed/camouflage or stealth/AD or AP Steroid depends if they keep AP Rengar. But this doesn&#039;t last forever, getting a kill on Rengar or an assist removes all the territory he has gained from that particular champion thus making Rengar not want to camp the same champion over and over again. Further, this territory could be similar to Skarner where they are always placed at permanent locations on the map, but you gain 1 of 5 for each unique kill. 5 enemies, 5 &#039;territories&#039;, and lose them the same way as mentioned earlier or not depends on balancing, i personally prefer the first version because it allows a Rengar to snowball if they make the right decisions but it also punishes them for making the wrong decisions kind of like Mejais. \n\nSecondly, i even though it is sad, i would like to see Rengar&#039;s ultimate removed. I think he should still keep his leap in bushes and it should be also added to his &#039;territory&#039; even out of brush as long as they make his territories have a stealth feature, perhaps if you claim &gt;5 territories you add stealth, on top of this maybe his territories could become upgraded granting him certain things at a certain amount of territories, building up to stealth as the final one or something better. Enemies should be able to distinctly be able to see where Rengar territory is and therefore if they walk into Rengar territory alone they will die if Rengar is there, this way Rengar fans are happy, but enemies know how not to die. The size of territories is debatable but it think something around dragon pit size or maybe each part of the map is sectioned into bits, Rengar killing someone in that location unlocks it permanently, but the tier of each territory goes up or down based on killing spree. There is so many things that could be altered here. \n\nI think they should keep his bola considering that&#039;s the only thing left of Rengar&#039;s intended identity.  His Ultimate should be something really unique and new to the game, possibly keep the nearest enemy vision still. His ferocity should be reworked or kept based on what his abilities are changed too i still think he should have high burst, but he should have the ability to stick to a target due to not having ultimate that makes him come out of no where. Enemies should be able to see him coming just like any other champion. \n\nPlease feel free to leave thoughts and comments and please share any other ideas.","replies":[{"poster":"Monkey Max","date":"2017-03-10T09:28:19.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Love the territory idea, i play Rengar a bit and it's hilarious walking up to someone, clicking on them and they die","replies":[{"poster":"aeras","date":"2017-03-14T03:29:45.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is very funny, but then you go and play someone like zed and realise how much harder it can be to get your opponent, and how zed relies on hitting his q's which are a skill shot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"aeras","date":"2017-03-06T12:22:42.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it normal for this low comment to view ratio?
