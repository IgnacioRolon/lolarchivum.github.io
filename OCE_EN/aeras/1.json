Whilst playing Rengar i quickly noticed that only being able to see the closest target to your champion is a huge nerf, multiple times i would jump onto a would be lone target only to quickly realise that they are in fact not alone, rather a group of 3 in the same bush. Warding during your ultimate is not a good idea since it cancel&#039;s your ultimate, even if it didn&#039;t, they can see you if you come that close to them attempting to ward. I believe that Rengar&#039;s ult should be changed once again so that it is both fair to the enemy and to the Rengar player, i also think that his ultimate should really define what it is to be a hunter. To me, a hunter must seek out its prey, using techniques such as tracking to locate and kill the target. Right now, for Rengar that isn&#039;t being met, his ultimate only shows the closest enemy champion, not his chosen prey. I believe that Rengar should be given more tools to hunt his prey. The idea i have is once you know where someone is you track their movements, i think his ultimate should only show the closest enemy champion, but once you find them they become tracked, tracked enemies are then visible to Rengar and his team until his ultimate ends, the more enemies tracked, the easier it will be for Rengar to find his prey safely thus making Rengar&#039;s ultimate less about chance and more about patience and skill. Enemies that are being tracked should get an icon above them, the enemy Rengar is closest too should get a different icon like the one that is being used now. Since you can no longer run face check during Rengar ultimate, i think it just makes sense to give him tracking capabilities. That way you can be certain you&#039;re not going to suicide into the enemy team. \r\n\r\nI want Rengar to be enjoyable to both parties, but the way he is now doesn&#039;t make sense to me. Thanks for reading, please share your opinions good or bad. If you haven&#039;t played the new Rengar i suggest you give him a try before issuing out criticism, i have 246,000 mastery points on Rengar, I am by no means the best player, but I like to believe that other Rengar players share my grief.","replies":[{"poster":"KnifeCat","date":"2016-11-11T01:30:20.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is also my main issue with new Rengar. The ult is a MAJOR nerf, as soon as you ult, the enemy knows you're coming and they immediately run off to their teammates. Trying to hunt them down before they retreat is barely possible (even with ult speed, mobas, ghostblade), since the warning range is ridiculously huge, they know you're there from miles away, and if you dare to chase a hunted opponent, you'll most likely jump into 2+ other hiding enemies by the time you've reached them.\n\nTbh I'd be happy with a q/passive nerf, or a nerf to the crit on ult, (as simply changing the ult and leaving him with so much dmg would make him broken) if it means i can hunt properly again..","replies":[{"poster":"aeras","date":"2016-11-11T01:55:22.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His ult might as well be no camouflage just Rengar yelling out globally, 'i am coming to kill someone, group up so that i cant do anything'. Seriously, its just a jump with a Critical strike now, his ultimate doesn't really give him anything useful, i mean sure its fun to run around the map invisible for 30 seconds, but that's eve's passive, and sure the movement speed helps with chasing, but talons E literally lets him path through walls. IMO his ultimate is fairly useless for hunting prey, the only thing its good for is if you want to initiate a team-fight as tank Rengar, and since Rengar is an assassin his ult doesn't suit him anymore.","replies":[]}]}]}
