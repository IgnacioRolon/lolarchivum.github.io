I&#039;m only in silver so i don&#039;t know an extreme amount about the game, but i would like to learn what i could&#039;ve done in this game. I really don&#039;t want to come to the conclusion that it was my teams fault and there was nothing i could do, because i understand that saying that will make me learn nil about getting better. \r\n\r\nIf you have any advice that will help me understand more about why I lost due to my actions solely, please tell me.  I can also attach replay link if you want to go that far.","replies":[{"poster":"Glow","date":"2016-09-22T10:37:04.615+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I can tell, this is at a point where it's not so much about how you played on an individual level, and more about how you played with your team. What strikes me is how long the game went on, allowing blue team to claw back the gold lead and eventually wipe out objectives until they won the game. I can't say much about you actions, but some generic stuff might apply:\n- Making sure you look to take objectives after you get kills, where possible. If nothing else, just pushing your minions to the enemy turret so the enemies lose gold and exp. \n- Coordinating your team to play around objectives. This includes learning how to manage map pressure (do you have a champ who can split push well? do you/the enemy team have teleport up?)\n- Learn when to back off from chasing kills. If you've just killed a couple of people, no need to greed for another kill if you can safely take an objective and back out.\n\nAlso, once the game goes that long, the team that wins is really whoever wins a teamfight while there are 50 second death timers. In late game, when everyone's fully built, you can easily push 3 turrets and end the game off 3+ kills if they're dead for a minute. \n\nGood on you for looking to improve! My advice is pretty generic but hopefully there's something helpful for you :)","replies":[{"poster":"aeras","date":"2016-09-22T11:13:46.269+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, it means a lot to me. I believe the team i was playing with that game was a 4 man, they were pretty ignorant of my calls etc. I think i recall 2 of them swearing at me during that game. But yeah i think a lot of the information you have given will help me get better, i think i realize now that i should use my lead help other lanes not necessarily get back into the game but rather to take objectives.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"aeras","date":"2016-09-23T11:16:01.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is the full replay of them game for those who really want to go in depth.
