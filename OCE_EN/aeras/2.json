Especially on champions such as {{champion:107}}  and {{champion:28}} who have the potential ability to do a high amount of damage from out of thin air with very little counter play. There has been a lot of talk about reworking these champions because of their stealth mechanic, but to me this is very sad because not only are these champions fun, but ultimately reworking them would take away from the characters theme and them in short it would be a different champion all together. After reading about potential reworks to my favorite Kitty Kat, some might say i was triggered. PLZ RITO NO REWORK KITTY.\n\nBut what if we can come to different ultimatum in which, stealth nor champions are reworked? I was reading through some comments on You tube when an idea suddenly came into my head, what about adding a mechanic into league, that every player has, which sole purpose is to be a counter to stealth. What if a player could press a button such as maybe Ctrl+5 or even the letter g (by default at least) that would act as an anti-stealth counter. It could be kind of like a sweeper except it wouldn&#039;t clear wards, it would be available at LVL 9 in game, and upon activation would give the summoner a brief moment of true sight, perhaps it could have a radar effect that could last for X amount of time, and have a cool down of X amount of time. I really don&#039;t think it should be added as a summoner spell, as i think the other summoner spells are far to valuable to be replaced by a short moment of anti stealth. But i think with a little bit of balancing, we shouldn&#039;t have to hurt either side of the argument. I think adding this feature could potentially make stealth much, much healthier. Another point worth mentioning, if this feature was to be added, and the animation is able to be seen by the person in stealth, it would make for some serious outplays, where the enemy could see approaching from one side but you come out from the other based on sheer timing, that would be SICK. Also the effect might be in pulses rather than radar because would be better for timing outplays from the stealth point of view as radar has a shorter lap as you get close to the target whereas pulses are at set intervals maybe every 2 to 3 seconds. But again, would need a lot of testing and balancing so that its doesn&#039;t make stealth useless or unhealthy as it is now.   \n\n\nHopefully we can go from this {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}                               To this     {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} \nand have a happy summoners rift that isn&#039;t full of sad adc&#039;s who always feel the full brunt of Rengar&#039;s sheer damage. \n\nPlease share some ideas and thoughts about this, and also post some other alternatives as well, i think if we can get riot to actually see this it would be very worthwhile.","replies":[{"poster":"Oprah Windfurry","date":"2016-06-09T10:02:17.532+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stealth is fine how it is already.

Vayne  can tumble during ult to leave you scratching your head.\n\nFor eve you just have to get deep wards in around camps to try keep track of her. If you're playing against champs with stealth you should carry pinks in your inventory and the upgraded sweeper. It's not completely broken there are things you can do.\n\nMaybe I've just completely missed the point though","replies":[{"poster":"aeras","date":"2016-06-09T10:08:33.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, so instead of having to buy a pink ward, there is a proper way to counter stealth for all champs.

Cant believe also forgot to mention Teemo and his shrooms ha jhin traps, shaco boxes. \n\nIt used to be oracles elixir a few seasons ago and there were huge cries when that got removed about stealth being op but it never really amounted to much.

Excellent points i might add, but yeah it would definitely work in a similar way to reksai's tremor sense. Basically, this feature, i guess in my opinion should only work with champions. i think any other forms of stealth aren't unhealthy, that's where sweeper comes in. I also think that the proposed idea should also make the champion able to be targeted when they are spotted by G (cant think of short name for my idea ill dub it as \"G\" for the key its bind to) for the half second or how ever long it is that riot see fit. So effectively champions in stealth would blink in and out of stealth based on where they are inside G. Although, when you think about it, it would make more sense if riot were to just upgrade the current sweeper or incorporate a new one called 'radar' which is effectively G. This way the enemy team wouldn't just use all of their G's at once, as you do need sweepers and you also need ward trinkets and blue trinkets. I think i just found the name tbh, radar fits.

This way people are inclined to stay closer to their support as counter play meanwhile not ruining these champion's ability to make picks {{champion:107}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:29}} (ofc these aren't the only champions with stealth).\nThis item is also rather uncommon on the majority of supports (other then {{champion:16}} ) and could help give it popularity in certain match ups.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Admar Redfang","date":"2016-06-09T19:36:02.293+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is an interesting topic I've been thinking about for a while now and I couldn't really find a solution I felt happy with.\nThe inherent problem with stealth is a champion's potential ability to pop up and eliminate an enemy before they can react. Another problem is the lack of globally available counterplay - the only thing every champion could have to counter stealth is a {{item:2043}} Vision Ward or a {{item:3341}} {{item:3364}} Sweeper trinket. If you - for whatever reason - just don't have one, you simply can't counter a stealth initiation on a lot of champions.\n\nSo, what solutions exist to this problem?\n_**First,**_ there's the possibility of adding global counterplay: Some way for every single champion in the game to at least be able to react to a stealthed enemy before they're attacked. First and foremost: I believe the Heroes of the Storm method is absolute garbage. Just making the champions transparent with a ripple effect on their position is super unfair for people who - for whatever reason - can't see that effect as well as others. Being far-sighted, I am such a person: Even after having a friend tell me exactly where the enemy Zeratul was, I simply physically couldn't spot him. So effectively he was completely stealthed for me, but completely visible to my friend.\nSo I am all for having stealth actually be invisibility. I think being indiscriminately unfair to everyone makes the mechanic much more healthy. But that would leave the question of how to add global counterplay. The proposed radar effect is an obvious solution to go to, but I don't like the idea of having an effect solely for countering another effect, and Riot seems to agree (see how they reacted to mobility - by having anti-mobility just be an optional side-effect of Cassiopeia's and Taliyah's abilities). So the next best question in my mind is: On what effect could an anti-stealth effect be added on to?\nSince I'm looking for global counterplay here, I'll just ignore specific champion abilities here - they affect only their respective champions and thus aren't global. Thus, it would have to be on a summoner spell or an ingame item. Currently there are no summoner spells that affect an area of effect - the last one was {{summoner:2}} Clairvoyance and that's gone (good riddance), so there's no easy target for an {{item:3348}} Arcane Sweeper effect. One interesting way would be to buff {{summoner:1}} Cleanse or {{summoner:21}} Barrier to also give an {{item:2047}} Oracle effect for a short time - those two spells are used as situational counters anyway and both have been struggling to find relevance lately.\nThe next best option would be the trinket item slot. The {{item:3341}}{{item:3364}}  Sweeper trinkets already have some anti-stealth components, but they're on very high cooldowns, and the trinket items mainly exist to play around wards anyway. It might be an interesting spin to have the yellow trinket grant champion stealth detection, but that would be a significant nerf to {{champion:28}} Evelynn and {{champion:35}} Shaco jungle by reducing their early game pressure, and overall I don't feel like it's the trinket slot's job to counter stealth abilities. It would fit thematically, but it would be somewhat overloaded and probably either nerf stealth too hard or buff vision/wards in strange ways as soon as there's a stealth champion in the game.\nSo the final option to just add global counterplay to stealth lies within the items. Riot's design paradigm for items is \"generalised offense, specialised defense\" and I think that's pretty much the best way to go about this. If an anti-stealth effect were added onto an offense item, it would mean that if a stealth champion falls behind, they're even more likely to stay behind if the enemy team picks up that item: Not only does the time they have to eliminate a target get smaller because the enemy deals more damage, but they can now begin to kill them before they even get the chance to maybe be useful in some way. If, however, that effect were added onto a defense item, then the enemy team is less incentivised to buy it if they're ahead. If, however, the stealth assassin starts snowballing, then the enemy team potentially has an easy answer to that. Such an item would be a big nerf to burst damage from stealth, but it would make it possible to increase a stealth champion's skirmishing power.\nHow exactly would an anti-stealth effect on an item look like? I have no real idea. Maybe something like ... If you and a nearby enemy you can't see and who's walking towards you are both out of combat, you get a warning; 90 seconds cooldown. Having an {{item:3348}} Arcane Sweeper on Summoner's Rift might be interesting too, but I'm really not happy with the idea of having an anti-stealth effect on an item.\n\n_**Second,**_ there's the possibility of reducing the power of stealth. However if it were so easy to balance champion power, stealth, counterplay, and player satisfaction, Riot would have done so a long time ago. So after seeing {{champion:28}} Evelynn, {{champion:107}} Rengar, {{champion:29}} Twitch, and {{champion:121}} Kha'Zix reworked and still having people complain about the stealth mechanic, I'm just going to assume that it's not that easy, and I'm not going to try.\nThe problem is that you can't simply remove stealth or nerf the frustrating aspects about it. It's an integral part of League of Legends by now. So I think the best solution is to give players the tools to counter stealth while still leaving the stealth users with options to make the plays they're famous for, and after writing this comment, I'm going to guess that this will happen either through changes in Summoner Spells or with a passive or even active item effect.","replies":[{"poster":"aeras","date":"2016-06-10T07:01:33.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly, i personally think a new mechanic should be added so that if you think there is a stealth champion you have to do something such as maybe pressing Ctrl+4 to break their stealth, this would mean that players have to stop their game play for a split second in order to break someones stealth, but in doing so they potentially risk having less time to react to other oncoming targets, or even the stealth champ. I think that making it into an item or a certain champ passive would be unhealthy game design as in a perfect world, there should be ways to outplay every mechanic in the game including stealth, more so the stealth on {{champion:107}}.  But i'm sure there are other more creative and smarter ways to go about this, we just need more people to bring their creativity to the table. Just so i can make it clear, this whole discussion to me, is more about saving Rengar, because to me his is fine the way he is, apart from stealth into one-shot with no counter-play (I'd rather have some form of proper counter-play in place rather than a rework to Rengar ult, or a rework to stealth).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChaosSpeer","date":"2016-06-09T16:26:56.655+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering I am an adc main, I do get the point about adding a counter play to stealth.

If I could attack/see her even if only for a half second, I would not have to die all the time, even though I did nothing wrong. I wanna know why, only cause I don't play vayne I can't win now?
