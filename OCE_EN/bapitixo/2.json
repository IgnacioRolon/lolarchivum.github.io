This is the Help & Support section so this isn&#039;t in the wrong place.\n\nNote: Don't believe this goes under a bug heading since it's a discussion about this issue and to see if people have found a solution (as submitting anything report wise takes 2 weeks to get a reply from a robot.. not very helpful)\n\nNOW back to the issue at hand, after the 5.14 update the client closes after the game where the post-game stats should be shown etc (where you can report people) however most of the time, since the update this hasn&#039;t been happening, the window won&#039;t open back up or anything, i have to close the client via the Task Manager just so i can open a new window and log back in to continue playing.\n\nIs there already a solution for this? because i&#039;ve been looking and can&#039;t seem to find anything that is similiar to this, or perhaps i&#039;ve overlooked another thread because of naming, not sure.. Does anyone else encounter this issue? no error messages or anything.","replies":[]}
