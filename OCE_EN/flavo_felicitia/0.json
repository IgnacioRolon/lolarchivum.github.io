I&#039;m garbage at league of legends in the grand scheme of things. But I think most people can agree with my reasoning here. Second, I&#039;M A SUPPORT MAIN. AND I REGULARLY GO SUPPORT BECAUSE I WANT TO.  My issue is not with me having to play support, it&#039;s with others having to play support. \r\nSupport is not a role like the others, yes you can be tanky, or have burst, or create massive wombo combos, but in the end, your sole goal is to keep your ADC alive long enough to kill the enemy team, Yes you also ward but everyone should be warding. No, your main goal as SUPPORT is to win the game by SUPPORTING YOUR ADC. Seems pretty obvious, common sense right? Apparently not.\r\nNow when someone is a support main, they understand this, so if let&#039;s say, you are me, trying to improve your mid lane skills (feeding a bit, carrying a bit less) and you get autofilled support, you do fine, you play normally and all is fine and dandy. Even if you don&#039;t play support, but you know how to, you do fine. \r\nNo, my issue is with the special players in this game who feel they are too good to be playing support or even at the very least knowing how to play it in case they get autofilled. Yes, some new players never HAD to learn support in case they were last pick in a ranked game because of the new ranking system, but that&#039;s all recent, and for the longest time, that wasn&#039;t the case. So I don&#039;t think they can be excused. \r\nSee the problem is when these people get Autofilled top or mid or adc or to an extent jg, they can play at least at an average level. But if they get autofilled support, my god are they useless. I wish they were useless even, they are antiproductive. Because they cant play any actual supports, and they don&#039;t dodge for some god forsaken reason, they pick champs like lux, brand, annie, etc. Mid laners, essentially. \r\nThere is nothing inherently wrong about playing a non meta support. I&#039;ve been screwed over by a brand support more times than i can count, but that&#039;s for actual supports, people who know how far they can push their burst before risking taking kills or cs from their ADC. These people don&#039;t know, and it seems, they don&#039;t care.\r\nThey buy a Spellthief&#039;s Edge {{item:3303}}, upgrade it, put 1 ward, and then play like mid laners. This is incredibly destructive. Ive seen these people intentionally take kills and cs because they think they need it or something, and then say the ADC is garbage or some crap like that. Yeah obviously if you screw over the ADC YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SUPPORTING THEY ARE GOING TO BE GARBAGE. That&#039;s why you are there, to make sure they get enough gold to be relevant, not to deny them gold like the glorified griefer you are. \r\nThe problem is that without an ADC, you are going to lose, I dont care if your nasus has 700 stacks at 10 minutes and your zed is 20/0/60. If your ADC is behind, and theirs is fed and not garbage in the current meta (im thinking xayah, vayne, jinx, twitch even, silver meta of course idk about higher elos). Most likely you are going to lose. Ive seen it time and time again, the support plays like a midlaner, their adc starts off strong but cant get the gold they need because the &quot;support&quot; is taking them, and the whole team crashes and burns. Even in the games we still win because the ADC managed to get enough gold to survive and the enemy ADC was made worthless. It&#039;s not fun for anyone when the support Lux decides to wait till everyone is nearly dead to take as many kills as possible while contributing nothing to the team fights. Not even a mid laner would do that. \r\nIf Riot won&#039;t ban these people, at the very least don&#039;t force the rest of us to have to deal with their crap. \r\nStop autofilling people support.","replies":[{"poster":"Joiksu","date":"2018-02-07T16:16:25.439+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I started maining support in season 4 when i saw how bad players were at support. I was sick of useless schmucks when I was the adc. When you play support properly you really improve your macro play. It seems now that supports are even worse these days than back then. It's not a hard role to learn, but the playstyle is different. People should put some time into learning it. Back then there was none of this forced role champion select and every player had to learn a little about every role, for the better it may be said.","replies":[{"poster":"Flavo Felicitia","date":"2018-02-08T03:20:15.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But no matter what we do, there will always be people who dont know how to play support, so rather than waste 40 minutes of our time and 20lp, why not just let the queue times be a bit longer.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-08T06:45:16.391+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The biggest issue is that with the population of OCE (and the population of supports on OCE) queue times wouldn't be 'a bit' longer, they'd more likely be in the realm of *at least* 10-15 minutes longer. When your queues are getting as games, it's not where you want it to be. A lot of people only have time for one or two games a day, should they be denied those?\n\nAs a support main you probably feel like queue times aren't that bad, as a support main myself, they aren't bad at all. Same goes for top mains. But mid mains right now? Jungle mains? They would be waiting forever to get games if autofill was turned off. There are plenty of people who are just gonna be asses about it and not learn anything, but autofill can be a valuable experience for those actually climbing.","replies":[{"poster":"Flavo Felicitia","date":"2018-02-09T14:15:24.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"very good points.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Joiksu","date":"2018-02-08T06:30:56.398+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah I'd agree with having the queue times a bit longer just so that everyone got their role. One thing they could do is delete \"blind pick\" mode, and have everyone in normals play draft. Then people would be more used to picking roles in champion select when it comes to ranked.
