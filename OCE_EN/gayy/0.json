This will hopefully be a chill and relaxed team that will try to take games serioulsy but still have fun during the course of it. Hoping to play regularly during holidays.\n\nI&#039;m looking for gold+ players to fill every role except adc (I&#039;m an ADC main). If you&#039;re not gold+ but feel you&#039;re good enough add me anyway (reanked team is different to soloq)\n\nSkype required for team talk and whatnot. \n\nNo trials required \n\nAdd me in game - &quot;Warmth&quot; or just post here. I'll be checking.\n\nEDIT- ROSTER HAS BEEN MADE THANKS FOR INTEREST THOUGH\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"TheScaryOne","date":"2015-12-15T06:53:35.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"plat 5 perfer top if you perfer gold i have a g5 account ","replies":[]},{"poster":"RippedChaos","date":"2015-12-14T00:18:03.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gold V Mid Main Here Available All Day Everyday.","replies":[]}]}
