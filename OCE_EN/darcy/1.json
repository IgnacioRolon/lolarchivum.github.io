Believe it or not, there are many people who wont touch ranked because they're not into the competitiveness of the queue and would rather play normals.\n\nObviously, you don't understand that the queues will be treated differently by the player base because, despite being the same basic mode and map, there are still significant differences between the two.\n\nAs for my replys being \"condescending\", it honestly just seems like you don't like someone giving you information that you asked for when it doesn't meet your expectations. If you'd like to have a mature, in depth conversation about why ranked would be treated so differently to normals, I'm willing (as are several other board-goers), but if all you're going to do is say that I'm being condescending then there's no reason for me to even try. Your choice.","replies":[{"poster":"Darcy","date":"2017-01-27T01:07:04.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's do that then, why do people think ranked is somehow a more competitive space? The only competitive ranked ladder is Solo/duo, Even flex 5v5 puts golds against diamond let alone 3v3s. The queue should be treated as a way to play progressively. I don't play normal TT because there is a lack of incentive to do so even though I believe TT ranked is a terrible ladder if considered competitively.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-01-27T01:41:13.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of people have different views on the situation, though. Some see it as \"ranked\" and think that it's a naturally more competitive queue, which it is. Ranked, unlike normals, gives people a \"goal\" to achieve, something to strive for, recognition of their abilities. As you've said, normals doesn't really give incentive for doing well outside the standard win/loss results, ranked does. Normals is a much more casual queue, and because of that you'll find that most/all casual players will avoid ranked altogether because they just don't want to be a part of it.\n\nI'm a bit like that myself. I see \"ranked\" (in any game) and just generally avoid it, because it just screams \"more competitive and more toxic\" to me. I don't need that kind of incentive to play, for me it's a game so I play for fun, not recognition or prizes.\n\nThat said, it's not like I haven't played ranked. I've got a total of 36 games since I started playing mid season 3, 6 in season 3 (I did terribly and just gave up on it), 10 in both season 4 and 6, and 10 in Ranked TT this season (really only because I think the queue deserves more \"air time\", so to say). In my experience, ranked *is* a lot more competitive, and that just seems to take away too much of the fun for me. I've not doubt there are more than a few others who feel the same way about it.\n\nSo when it comes down to it, it's more a matter of \"casual\" vs \"competitive\" players. With the casual players, you're most likely to find them in normals or \"fun\" modes, whereas with the competitive players, you're most likely to find them in ranked and normals. Considering that, it seems only logical that normals would get a lot more attention than ranked, and so a test such as the one running for Ranked TT now makes sense to get a feel for those difference and determine the viability of the queue, and even whether it's worth having more time for ranked than normals.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
