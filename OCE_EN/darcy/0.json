I got placed in SIII which I think is a fucking joke but regardless I decided to climb to g5 in flex just because silver is ew. I got to Silver I gold promos, did 1 match and got placed into silver II.... What the actual fuck. \n\nOh btw, my friend (Imaginative) was plat V last season, got placed in Plat IV flex then today did 1 game and got placed in gold V. This is only fixing bronze players being placed too high but punishing the rest of us.\n\nWe both won our placement games.\n\nEDIT: Looking through my friends list I have a gold V player that got placed too high before (Gold I) but now replaced into Bronze I. That isn't OK at all.\n\nI also have a Plat IV player on here placed in Bronze...","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-15T04:30:26.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Update here:\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/XMZm8OPI-ranked-corrections-to-placement-results-and-ranks","replies":[{"poster":"Darcy","date":"2016-11-15T04:57:36.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you read my post?

Work on improving yourself as a LoL player instead of solely focusing on rank.

I am higher than the average person and want to climb and improve past where I am currently, I don't want to waste time doing what I've already done. I can play any role in silver and low gold and win games, I didn't climb from 1 tricking. If you go on reddit there is a lot of people angry about this because yeah, they're used to be placing a few divisions lower than they started except this time it's entire leagues. Whilst I understand it's to combat dynamic queue's inflated climbing through premades (which I did not engage in) and the latest reset was due to some people at low rankings being able to climb well past where they should have, this has been done in the wrong way. Having a blanket reset on people who were actually placed properly in the first place and already climbed in a stable way. (It took me over 40 games to go Silver III to Silver I 80 LP even though I'm G2). IT's definitely a punishment. They should have only reset people who were placed above their weight or way too low below their original ranking.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-15T05:10:05.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I only have as much information available to me as you do, I was simply pointing you in the direction of said information.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
