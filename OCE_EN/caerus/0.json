The ping is constant, and if this happened in all games I would be sure it&#039;s an issue on my end.\r\n\r\nBut it&#039;s odd.\r\n\r\nThe ping only occurs in ranked. I play a blind normal&#039;s, I enjoy my regular ping. Hop into ranked soon after, and bam, 71 ping constant.\r\n\r\nI am with TPG, and I am not sure if this is strictly only myself, or all TPG users. If a Riot dev could give me an update or check-up so I can further isolate the problem that would be really handy.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-12T12:15:15.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Caerus,\n\nI'm sorry to hear that you're encountering connection issues to the League of Legends servers.
