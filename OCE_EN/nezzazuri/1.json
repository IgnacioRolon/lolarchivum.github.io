Tactical Gaming is currently recruiting members!\r\n\r\n**Introduction**\r\nTactical Gaming (TG) was created in November 2004 to bring together like-minded gamers from around the globe and from multiple platforms (Consoles, PC &amp; Mobile), to provide them Head Quarters (web site) where they can share their backgrounds, experience, and interests in teamwork and tactics, as well as providing them with an environment that allows a &ldquo;friends-first&rdquo; experience in the online community.\r\n\r\n**What we believe**\r\nWe believe that regardless of origin, nationality, age, gender, race, religious beliefs or creed, disrespectful behavior towards one another is unacceptable. The same belief is applied to gaming. With the notion that so many people share the common passion for video games, the vision and mission is to bring together like-minded gamers from around the globe and from multiple platforms, to provide them head quarters (web site) where they could share their backgrounds, experience, and interests in teamwork and tactics, as well as providing them with an environment that allows a &ldquo;friends-first&rdquo; experience.\r\n\r\n**Squads**\r\nTactical Gaming is different from other communities because we offer Squads! Instead of finding people, you will be placed with people of your skill level. You will be placed with 4+ other members (including a leader) getting better at mechanics, teamwork, call outs, etc.\r\nIn these squads, you will have 2 mandatory practices. These practices will be held at night on Saturdays and Wednesdays (time varies with states). If you feel like the team needs more practice then ask the leader for some optionals.\r\nLeaders of TG know that we all have lives outside of League so please keep in mind to tell your leaders that you can&#039;t attend a practice. 6 AWOLS or 3 consecutive AWOLS will result in an automatic discharge. AWOLS are also permanent.\r\n\r\n**What we offer**\r\nTeamspeak Server\r\nSquad with people around your skill level/tier\r\nForum\r\nRanking system\r\nMultiple gaming divisions\r\nPractices will be at night every Wednesday and Saturday.\r\n\r\nRegistration Link : http://www.tacticalgaming.net/hq/index.php?app=referrals&amp;reff=25844 (PS its 1st battalion not 2nd)\r\n \r\nPlease comment below if you have registered or for any questions! I would be glad to answer all of them!","replies":[{"poster":"OctopusTaKÃ³","date":"2016-02-17T02:13:32.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: Smoochie, mid/ top or sup","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kitty Katt","date":"2016-02-16T23:11:40.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tried to join a month ago got no reply.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SKT T1 Taehoon","date":"2016-02-14T23:18:31.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hit me up on lol tonight","replies":[]}]}
