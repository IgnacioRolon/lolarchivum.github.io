Register now to join our community of like minded gamers. TG consists of active gamers which have a &quot;real life first&quot; mindset. We aim to satisfy our member&#039;s needs for team based gaming by having our Tactical Warfare franchise for warfare based games and our Tactical Sports franchise for sports based games.\r\n\r\nBasically the OCE side of the league of legends division is looking for some new players. Any rank, any level, anybody is welcome. We do 2 mandatory practices a week and in addition some get together for optional practices. If you are more looking for a ranked team experience you can still join and give some of our members a PM as I&#039;m sure they&#039;d be keen to start up a team.\r\n\r\nFor signing on there is an initial registration which takes about 2 min to do, then someone has to confirm it which may take up to 24 hours. After that there is a boot camp which involves a test. After that you are assigned to a squad and then proceed to start your journey with TG.\r\n\r\nFeel free to add me on league client &quot;nezzazuri&quot; if you have any questions/problems, I will be happy to help.\r\nIn addition feel free to use &quot;nezzazuri&quot; as a referrer on the registration.\r\nPS OCE is 1st battalion not 2nd\r\n\r\nTHANKS FOR YOUR TIME!!! SEE YOU ON THE BATTLEFIELD SUMMONERS!!!\r\n\r\nRegistration link:\r\nwww.tacticalgaming.net/hq/index.php?app=core&amp;module=global&amp;section=register","replies":[{"poster":"MAXConviction","date":"2016-10-02T07:44:34.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am interested in signing up ;)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2016-09-19T11:59:21.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"nezzazuri","date":"2016-09-20T05:49:11.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We sure do accept premades! Unfortunately Im not sure we can provide you with coaching as our highest ranked player is diamond like you guys. As for managing you can talk to the higher ups and they can probably organise something for you, we have had competitive teams in the past. For scheduling all squads have practice 2 days a week however you can organise more with your team if you like (I assume you would be playing a lot more being a competitive team).","replies":[{"poster":"AsianEmoKuntFlap","date":"2016-09-20T22:14:33.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And im shit at coaching","replies":[{"poster":"AsianEmoKuntFlap","date":"2016-09-20T22:14:53.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"soz swearing","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Merladdin","date":"2016-09-19T10:43:02.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"does this cover OCE servers / players....or OS based ? i notice the site is .net  so not sure","replies":[{"poster":"nezzazuri","date":"2016-09-19T11:28:57.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, Im recruiting specifically for OCE server","replies":[]}]}]}
