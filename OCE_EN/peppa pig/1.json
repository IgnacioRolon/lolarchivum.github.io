I was playing a normal Aram game with this meme playing on discord. No one else typed anything in all chat, except for me. It was suppose to be a joke for my friends, but I think someone from the enemy team got offended by the lyrics :(. It is immature of me and a mistake to post it in all chat though. I also find it strange that I got a 14 day suspension despite not getting any 25 game chat restrictions previously. Or is it because I was reported for racism that got me a 14-day?","replies":[{"poster":"Sp1rit Rush","date":"2017-06-17T01:55:57.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It will be because it was racist, Riot has 0 Tolerance for it","replies":[{"poster":"Chronicc","date":"2017-06-18T12:23:54.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"riot have infinite tolerance for shitkunts tho...","replies":[]}]}]}
