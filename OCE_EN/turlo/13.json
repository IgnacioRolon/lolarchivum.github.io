I tried to contact Riot Support, after 2 days I got a generic 'copy-paste' message which didn't even address my problem. I waited another 2 days for them to tell me that my request has been transfered over to the 'Player Behaviour' department. It's been over 7 days and still no response, I even bumped my request to make sure it hadn't been burried somehow.\r\n\r\nNot really sure what to do since Riot Support doesn't seem to be helping at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2015-01-29T02:45:54.328+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your season rewards were removed due to elo-boosting during the 2014 season, which I have taken the time to confirm.
