For your curiosity top lane is my secondary, but I've been playing for 5 and a 1/2 years so I understand the dynamics and champs. \n\nAs for 5s experience I've played in 4 full on competitive teams, once in an organisation's sister team and if my  memory serves me correctly 12 semi-competitive friendly teams. I'm usually a mid laner, but I can change on the fly rather easily. \n\nIf you're interested then either reply to my comment or add \"Lovesick\". Idk how picky you'll be, but my offer is always present.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RatuManu","date":"2017-01-26T06:33:32.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"where do i sign up","replies":[]}]}
