For those of you who aren't familiar with whitepumah, he is a Silver 5 player who has built a reputation for himself with his controversial opinions and play-style. We were curious about his renowned opinions and were thrilled to hear whitePumah except our offer to interview him and shed some light on these theories.\r\n\r\n**You may recognise whitePumah from such posts as: **\r\nhttp://forums.oce.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=78211&highlight=whitepumah\r\nhttp://forums.oce.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=19451&highlight=whitepumah\r\nhttp://forums.oce.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=19696&highlight=whitepumah\r\n\r\n**Backgrond:** whitePumah is a 20 year-old male from Syndey who has ambitious dreams of leading his Bronze IV team to the professional scene. whitePumah started playing ranked League of Legends in Season 3, where he played 1185 ranked games. He finished Seaon 4 in Silver V, having played 1289 ranked games. He averaged a KDA of 8.2/8.4/7.1 across all champions over the 4th season but remains adamant that he is among the best League of Legends players in the world (particularly in regards to theory-crafting level).\r\n\r\n**Some outstanding quotes from the interview include:**\r\n“I believe I have the strategies that the professionals have not yet looked into.”\r\n“The individual is 10% of the game, your 10% is dependant on the other 90% of the game how well you do. You can make a minor impact on the outcome of your game.”\r\n“Even if you were the best in the world and simply had the worst luck with teammates you don’t get the chance to trial.”\r\n“Everything that I have tested is mathematically and experience based, what i do always provides a better outcome for me both mathematically and in game feel.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Interview**\r\n\r\n**A common explanation low ELO players provide as to why they remain in low ELO for long periods of time is because they keep on being put with incompetent teammates. In your experience, is there any truth to this statement?**\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n**Do you think you could elaborate as to why this is?\r\n**\r\nThe matchmaking system matches players with others based on their MMR, this is determined by their win/loss ratio of each player not their individual ability, meaning that players with the same MMR can have vastly different skill levels. So when they try to evenly match a game using MMR as the factor, it can be heavily favoured to one team. And as there are 10 players in a game, one player is only 10% of the result of the game; so matchmaking can’t be accurate and players can and frequently are matched with teams that the enemy have more teamwork. \r\n\r\n**Okay, that being said; every player who is high ELO today was at one stage in bronze or at least silver. Do you feel that these players got to their high ELO simply because they were lucky with the teammates they were put with?**\r\n\r\nPartially\r\n\r\n**Are there any other factors at play? Maybe some that can be controlled by the individual?**\r\n\r\nThe individual is 10% of the game, your 10% is dependant on the other 90% of the game how well you do. You can make a minor impact on the outcome of your game\r\n\r\n**Taking that into consideration how is it that every pro player is in high ELO?**\r\n\r\nCause the communities base a players ability on whether they are high ELO or not, therefore only high ELO players can actually become known and considered for the pro teams. You literally can't get a trial for a pro team if you are not the ELO they require you to be at, so you don't get a chance to prove your skill level despite your ELO. Even if you were the best in the world and simply had the worst luck with teammates you don’t get the chance to trial.\r\n\r\n**Interesting, moving on to your outlook on to the game being played as premade 5:\r\nAfter reviewing many of your forum posts, you seem to have the mentality that in order to be successful in ranked 5’s there needs to be a single dominant authority figure with power over everything. Explain your thoughts behind this, especially in regards to the fact that the best teams in the world all place great value in playing as a team and respecting each other’s opinions and play-styles.**\r\n\r\nWhen you have a dominant figure in charge of everything they can have set ups which he alone knows in-depth and can expand in. The others players don’t have the in-depth, knowledge and understanding of everything revolving around what he is trying to achieve with the strategies. So basically its like researching into a scientific field; you don't have people from other fields telling you what you should be doing in your own field.\r\n\r\n**This would require a high level of trust towards the leader of the team, do you think this kind of trust is achievable in a game like League of Legends where each player is in control of one fifth of the team?**\r\n\r\nYes. You have to build a team purely based around it, trust is everything once you find players who can work with it.\r\n\r\n**These are some excerpts from one of your recruitment posts for your ranked 5’s team.\r\n“This team is being run as a leadership based team which I am the leader of. I do the shot calling, the in game strategy, including team comps, builds, ward setups and general laning phase style of play.”\r\nWould you mind providing some input of your reasoning behind builds and play-styles you feel are viable, contrary to both the pro-scene and the vast majority of high ELO players. (eg teleports on all ADCS, Galio jungle, etc.).**\r\n\r\nEverything that I have tested is mathematically and experience based, what I do always provides a better outcome for me both mathematically and in game feel.\r\n\r\n**Is that based on the success you have in ranked 5vs or soloq?**\r\n\r\nBoth. I would be in bronze 5 if I built like everyone else, no doubt. For the team comps my theorizing is heavily favouring my side, no matter how much I try to find ways to beat it. No one has yet to have answers to beating it in theory. Not all of the team comps, but my main one. With Galio jungle, Kayle support, Twitch ADC, Morgana mid and Zilean top.\r\n\r\n**One more point before I move on to my final topic. As a player who has played thousands of games of League of Legends; when you play SoloQ what is the main thing that you find is hindering you from gaining ELO, and one thing you think you can work on to climb in the future?**\r\n\r\nNo matter what I do my team-mates somehow manage to do the very things that hinder me. One thing I can work on is checking the scoreboard before I go in on someone, because 90% of the time they are fed. But if I can't do anything about any one of them then only thing I can do is split push and hope my team can make use of the number advantage they will have. If that fails then I attempt to hold off til late game where I get my insane power spike if that still fails then we lose.\r\n\r\n**Ok, final question. Through browsing your forum posts I have discovered an interesting theory of yours that I was hoping you could shed some light on. The general idea of your theory is that players achieve high ELO simply through playing Duo Queue, and that you consider yourself on the same level as somebody like Faker but feel he is only in Challenger and yourself in low Silver because he players Duo Queue. Could you explain this theory in a little more depth?**\r\n\r\nWhen you duo queue you can use combinations as well as play the bot lane to its maximum efficiency. You use champions that boost the effectiveness of carries such as Kayle and Twitch (who) can 2v5 in solo queue due to lane dominance because of Kayle’s kit and the set-up I have worked out. Late game Twitch is the best equipped to take out an entire team and Kayle can make twitch invulnerable for 3 seconds, giving Twitch time to be able to kill an entire team and carry the team to victory in teamfights. This is the only effective way I have found to carry my teams.\r\n\r\n**Do you think duo queuing is a defining difference between players in silver and those in challenger?**\r\n\r\nVery much so. Even Reginald made a vlog about it and he couldn’t get out of low ELO but everyone else in his team had duo queued to get out.\r\n\r\n**If this is true, what stops everyone from reaching challenger?**\r\n\r\nSomeone has to win and someone has to lose. Everyone can’t have a positive win/loss ratio.\r\n\r\n**Ok keeping that in mind, how do you think you would fare against Challenger players, or even pros?**\r\n\r\nI have already played against challenger in a tournament and did quite well in my opinion. I was comfortable and knew what i was doing the whole time\r\n\r\n**Ok, to conclude, you are a silver 5 player with thousands of games played. After not seeing success in Solo Queue, what keeps you motivated to play?**\r\n\r\nI want to play professionally and I am looking to use ranked 5's as the way to get there and I believe I have the strategies that the professionals have not yet looked into. The professionals in league of legends are at a very low strategy point of the meta. They are relying on using skill over strategy\r\n\r\n**Do you think this difference in skill you point out is the reason you are silver and he (Imp) is challenger?**\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n**You just think he got lucky with his teams?**\r\n\r\nI’m not 100% sure. I made a new account and at level 5 I was getting better teammates than when I was playing solo queue 3000 games. I could tell by the players mechanics that they were indeed new to the game so there is something about my main account that puts me with teammates far worse than others\r\n\r\n*Images of unedited interview - http://imgur.com/a/oRanD\r\nInterview conducted and edited by ImDooly & Wraithhz (aka intero)\r\n*","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-11-14T02:02:36.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I could revive this thread (>whitepumah<), I have refined my entire understanding on the mathematics of the game. For example, I believe that due to the adjustment of mmr being positive or negative because of the binary condition of either win or loss. Every player is 20% of their team, and as they are always 20% of their team, their rank will always be 20% accurate. No matter how many games are played, the ratio will always be 20%.\n\nI have in fact collected data regarding average teammates kda over multiple accounts and how it links to win rates in the players statistics.\n\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/30Td789c-comparing-the-average-kda-of-teammates-over-multiple-accounts\n\nFun fact is that in my sample size, 98% of games that a team has a positive k/d will be won, the reverse is true. So I find these statistics quite accurate relative to results.\n\nThe thing I am finding is that everyone is overlooking the definition of probability. The chance of 50% balanced teammates might be higher compared to every other potential outcome, but combined there is a MUCH HIGHER chance to not be 50%. This leads to major imbalance in the system, which ultimately escalates the problem ever since its first game played in ranked. \n\nThe ratio will always be the same and the only possible way to bypass the problem with this system. is if every player was put in a team with every other player and put against every other player, in every combination, and their performance must never change throughout each game. Using this method it would take approximately 10^51 games played in OCE (1 million playerbase) to determine the true rankings.\n\nGalio jungle has been replaced by Amumu jungle since Galio rework and no team with the ability to play the team comp to what I would call a decent standard, has ever given it a serious attempt.\n\nSo whilst I have evidence of it being able to work on a theoretical level and with amazing as expected results when used in a low level team against teams several leagues above. No one has any evidence of it failing in any other kind of environment.\n\nI have never been unable to either answer a question or come up with a realistic solution to a weakness.\n\nSome people come to troll me but then claim to \"see how it could work\" after detailed explanation.\n\nWith the new league profile stats, I also managed to hit a 45% damage contribution with twitch this season again. (Considering I am usually competing with 3 other carries who try to take my farm and scavenge kills from me at EVERY opportunity) The average challenger player would hit approximately 30% damage contribution.\n\nPeople try to tell me I am wrong without any explanation. This makes me want to follow in Hitlers footsteps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NZL Fawn","date":"2016-11-06T00:54:55.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just had an argument with him lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheBasedGod","date":"2014-11-22T14:55:56.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This individual raises some interesting points...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-11-06T02:02:14.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Guys like kkoma have full control over champion select when they are coaching SKT on stage. That's partially because Koreans have a certain discipline to respect the coach's decisions and never question it, until after the games are over and they can break down things in a post-mortem analysis. It is true that the scene puts more emphasis on ranking when it comes to analysts/coaches etc and there are a few people out there that actually are high level strategists with poor soloqueue levels. Why? Because mechanics has little bearing on understanding.\n\nHaving said that, I've had conversations with this guy and particularly over his team composition strategies and after raising certain critical points, he did not lead me to believe that he could justify his picks. No one team composition is perfect in a game of league of legends, or that composition would have been figured out by now. Perhaps he could use it to counter an enemy's composition sure, but any composition is beatable, excluding what actually happens in game. Take a look at \"Galio jungle, Kayle support, Twitch ADC, Morgana mid and Zilean top.\" The striking thing about this is the lack of waveclear and early pressure. Pre-6 it is extremely weak and squishy. If that composition falls behind (especially in the current meta) they will not be coming back.\n\nThe other thing is that coaching is much more than just the game. Its the coaches ability to bring out the best in players, handle team issues, build positive schedules going forward. This is why TSM hired Weldon for sports psychology to boost their performance in season 6. I think it really made a difference. Just having a coach barking orders is rather negative for a team in general. It makes players feel like they are robots.\n\nI believe Whitepumah is a real enthusiast and it would be nice to see him managing a team in the OOL. However the best way that he could hope to achieve that at the moment is to have some sort of financial backing. The image of a low elo coach (or even analyst) just does not go down well with high level players. Even those with financial backing and improper management skills (e.g. Sentinels in OCS) will fail.\n\nWill be silently following the progress.. good luck!","replies":[]}]}
