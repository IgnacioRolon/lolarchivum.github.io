However currently i find myself having games that last 15-25 minutes with the match being completely one sided. Also, as a consumer I shouldnt have to worry about the life of the game. I am worried that this game will die and I shouldnt feel this way at all.\r\nPlease do something about the current state of the game theres so much that needs to be tuned and tweaked.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-07-21T09:57:38.642+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you buy cloth then tell the shop that you fear it would be out of trend? \n\nYou are using money ingame for the momentary pleasure of the purchased product; Not an investment on the  stock market. \n\nIf you're that tensed up about spending money on league, then you should do something else with it. \n\nAlot of people said things need to change, but often dont offer any solution. Then, there is the issue of what you think is better, others see it as a downgrade. It is not easy to evolve a product and not taking risks. Online games need constant upgrades to keep it interesting, and not every major changes is gonna be a hit.\n\nJust play it for what it is, if it is no longer fun.
