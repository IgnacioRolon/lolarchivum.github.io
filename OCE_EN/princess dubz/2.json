A good example of this is someone like jhin. One year after jhin was released he got a blood moon skin and from the latest leaks it seems like diana and twitch are going to get more skins. It just doesnt make sense to me at all how some champs can get cared for while others are just forgotten. Lets use shaco as an example. Shaco recieved his last skin in 2015 2 years ago in that time 2 zed skins have come out, 2 yi skins, 2 kennen skins and 2 tryndamere skins. It doesnt sound like alot but when you really think about how many more i didnt mention you begin to understand. Some champs also have the best personality for halloween but never get halloween skins. Lets use shaco again, the guy is a real scary demon jester, and you could go wild with skin ideas for him, but instead we are getting a halloween aurelion sol skin instead like seriously? I understand the notion of some champs having more skins then others and its perfectly fine to give champs like aurelion a skin as since his release he hasnt gotten any, but why do we have to have him as the halloween skin for this year why cant it be someone else that is actually scary like mordekaiser? His lore is all about how he torments souls and tortures them while they do his bidding. \r\nWhat is everyones thoughts on the subject?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-08-15T09:20:20.908+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember that skins are a creative process, and also a quality controlled one. There's a bit more to it than just \"x champion hasn't had a skin in a while\". I don't pretend to work on the skins teams or in anything like them so the order of this will likely be a bit out of whack, but it'll give you the general idea of just how much goes into it.\n\nFirst, they need an concept. Maybe that concept isn't suitable, or maybe it's infringing on another skins theme, or maybe it's causing clarity issues because it looks to much like another champion, maybe it's for a champion who is getting a rework soon, or maybe it just isn't up to their quality standards yet. Some champions are easier to concept for than others. It's difficult to find a unique and interesting (and *fitting*) theme for something as niche as a hunchback gravedigger, while on the other hand its easy to find interesting concepts for a stabby duel wielding knife assassin. Being a mainstream trope as opposed to a superbly unique character has it's advantages.\n\nSo then, the idea has to be reworked and edited. Some concepts might need no iterations, and some might need many, and some might be shelved to be worked on later if something higher priority comes along. At any rate, now you have your concept, but that isn't the end of the road.\n\nYou have a concept, which usually means you have concept art, now that's a great start, but how realistic is it? You can make a mad cool skin, but if the tech doesn't support it yet, you might have to rework it again, or shelve it until the tech can support it. Aurelion Sol is a good example of this (though ofc he is a champion and not a skin) as the tech didn't support what they wanted to do with the champion. The turn mechanics introduced by Aurelion are also a good example of the tech advancing/catching up, and that tech was later retroactively applied to things like Hecarim's tail.\n\nWhat tier will your skin be? If it's an 1820+ skin, do you still have access to the voice actor for x champion or do you need to try and find someone similar?\n\nSo now you have concept art and have established viability, now you need readability. This applies to the skin itself of course, but also the abilities. For any skin tier higher than 750 skill readability has to be considered. If you get in game and can't tell the difference between the ally Ori ball hurtling towards you and the enemy Veigar ult then that's a problem.\n\nSo now you have a readable, workable skin concept. Now you have to worry about resources. Riot has more than one skin team (I'm not entirely sure how many they do have, but I believe it's in the realm of 3) which means they are working on more than one skin at once. You might get really unlucky with your timing and finalise a skin concept just as the last game asset dev slot has been taken up, because they aren't going to wait for your skin when they have x other concept that has been finalised and waiting, which means your skin can't progress until one of those teams is free. There might also be other skins being prioritised like the Worlds team skins which means even if you do get a dev slot your skin might be put on hold until those have been completed.\n\nSo now you have your resources. While developing the in-game assets you might run into troubles with rigging the textures or with an animation quirk you were going to add to it. Obviously the tier of skin here drastically affects how long this process takes, since a lot more work goes into a 1820 skin than a 750. YOu have to develop the textures, the new models in the higher tiers, the SFX, the VFX, check the readability, redo that skill animation, that one's too clunky, that one is the wrong colour, that animation breaks the skin and so on and so forth.\n\nNow finally you have a working skin, but now you need to playtest it, and playtest it, and playtest it. This starts with an internal team, then moves to PBE. If the skins causes problems, you have to squash them, and fast, and sometimes that is easier said than done. The more complex a skin, the more likely it is to cause problems in playtesting.\n\nAnd then, finally you have your skin.\n\nIf they tried to make skins in the manner of \"this champion is next in line\" then we'd end up with a whole bunch of mediocre skins, and *especially* for a company like Riot that runs on a free to play model (I.E the paid content has to be desirable to a wide audience or they lose money fast) that is not a good way to go.\n\nTry thinking of it this way. It isn't a matter of x popular champion getting a skin instead of y unpopular champion, rather it's a matter of x champion getting a skin instead of wasting time with noone getting a skin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2017-08-15T12:34:41.199+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Basically if the champion is shit but popular, they will get a lot of skins just for the sake of it. They say they are working on champions with less skins, but the sad reality is that the same popular champions will keep getting skins because they are the only ones that sell apparently.","replies":[{"poster":"Scuxxx","date":"2017-08-15T23:02:46.043+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"very true, look at ahri. {{champion:103}}","replies":[{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2017-08-17T04:03:09.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I am kinda hoping that since her new skin is Legendary, that means they are done with her for awhile, but if she got another skin before the end of the year I wouldn't be surprised.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
