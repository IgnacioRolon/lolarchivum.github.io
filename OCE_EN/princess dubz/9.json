I dont know why anyone hates it! Like people often say: \"But I cant use the chat or talk to my friends!\" And I just say, well thats the client saying that now isnt the time to talk to friends or communicate with your team! Its giving the enemies an advantage they need as well as your own crippling depression!\r\n\r\nNot to mention if it doesnt load you into your match at all! Why would it? I mean hey! Maybe its saying that now isnt the right time to play the game! It might want you to play Halo instead!\r\n\r\n\r\nFix your trash client.","replies":[]}
