Any tips for a returning player?","subforum":"GD","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven&#039;t played since the OCE server got made, I transferred my account here but never played again. Was never very good in the first place, usually hovered around Gold 4-5. \r\n\r\nCurrently waiting on what is now a very large download.\r\n\r\nAfter not playing for so long, one of the things I remember the most clearly is that players aren&#039;t usually very patient with players who have no idea what they are doing - could anyone really quickly fill me in on what I&#039;ve missed so my first game isn&#039;t a total atrocity and I don&#039;t get reported for being bad.\r\n\r\nIf it helps, about the time that I left, the meta was top and mid solo, aggressive/suicidal jungler, and adc/support in the bottom lane; anyone who&#039;s KDA was significantly worse than the rest of their team got reported for being bad (and yelled at), and split pushing was very hard to stop in solo queue.\r\n\r\nPlease, some quick tips to save me from making a fool of myself,\r\n&lt;3toddles","replies":[]}
