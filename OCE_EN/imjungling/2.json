If Baldomar does not have enough &quot;Blood&quot; to activate his abilities, the 2x the missing &quot;Blood&quot; will be deducted from his health for the activation instead.\n\nQ: Blood Needle (skillshot)\n30/25/20/15/10 Blood\n8/7/6/5/4 seconds\nBaldomar throws a needle made of blood, dealing 30/40/50/60/70 (+10%AD) magic damage. Killing a unit with &quot;Blood Needle&quot; refunds the cost, and restores additional 5/10/15/25/35 &quot;Blood&quot;.\n\nW: Blood Vial (trap)\n60/70/80/90/100 Blood\nBaldomar hides a glass vial of blood on the battlefield. Activating his Q or E while within 400 range of the vials cause the vials to burst, and the blood inside to shoot back to Baldomar, restoring &quot;Blood&quot; (equal to casting cost) and 12/25/40/55/70 HP. Enemies hit by the blood stream take 20/30/40/50/60 magic damage and are marked for his ultimate. Healing is increased by 20/40/60/80/100% for each enemy champion hit.\n\nE: Forge/Refine (self-buff)\nForge: Baldomar forges a blade from blood, which lasts 3 auto attacks before breaking. While the blade is still active, Baldomar&#039;s auto attacks gain 20 range and 50AD.\nReforge (only castable if &quot;Forge&quot; is active): Baldomar reforges and refines his blade, refreshing it&#039;s durability and gains a stack of &quot;Refined&quot;. Each stack further increases the blade&#039;s AD by 50. Can be stacked up to 10 times. Attack range further increases at 5 and 10 by 20. Further casts of &quot;Refine&quot; only refreshes durability.\nUpon death, all stacks of &quot;Refined&quot; are lost.\n\nR: (AOE damage and CC) (to be named*)\nIncreases max &quot;Blood&quot; to 500. Baldomar causes the blood of his enemies in a target area to writhe painfully for 2 seconds, dealing 100/150/200 (+20%AP) magic damage, restoring 25/50/75 &quot;Blood&quot; for each enemy champion affected. Enemies marked by Baldomar&#039;s W are also stunned for the duration.\n\nBaldomar is a fighter/buiser who specializes in large battles (teamfights, middle of minion wave etc). Overall, I don&#039;t think his kit is too overloaded. His lack of mobility and CC in his basic abilities means that he is susceptible to early ganks if he pushes out too much. Similar to Nasus, to get the most damage, he needs stacks. As all &quot;Refined&quot; stacks are lost on death, and his dependence on the stacks, ganks are very important. If given a chance to snowball, be will snowball hard.\n\nI think that the passive is quite interesting, as you will have to eventually decide whether you want to spend health for your abilities. The only problem is that you can technically stay in fountain and spam your E to gain 10 stacks without much repercussion. I don&#039;t want to remove the way you can spend health in the middle of a fight to give an attack buff, but it still leaves the fountain + E problem. I&#039;m open to suggestions.\nThe Q is quite straightforward. You use it to farm &quot;Blood&quot;. It&#039;s a skillshot. Any questions?\nBaldomar&#039;s W is interesting, in the way that, while it is a trap (technically), it need to be manually set off. As it is Baldomar&#039;s only form of sustain, and empowers his ultimate, it will require careful positioning and planning, much more than traps which deal instant damage.\nOf course, all names are probably going to be changed.\n\nI will upload concept drawings in near future (probably)","replies":[]}
