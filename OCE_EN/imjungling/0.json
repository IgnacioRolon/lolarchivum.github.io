However, every few games, my frame rate would gradually drop until the screen would literally freeze for several seconds at a time. I&#039;ve tried quitting the game, then reconnecting, but when I do that, my pc would freeze on the game screen, and prevent any further actions (task manager, alt+tabbing etc). The only way to fix this was to force restart my pc. However, due to this, I&#039;ve been placed in the low priority queue (because I&#039;m disconnecting to fix my game). Does anyone know a fix?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-03T01:50:11.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The first thing I would recommend is update your graphics drivers, as this tends to be the most likely culprit for issues like these.\n\nNext I would look at the fixes here in case your issue is related: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209010626-Frame-Skipping-on-High-End-PCs\n\nFailing that I'd run through any fixes found here you haven't tried yet: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-troubleshooting\n\nIf all else fails submit a ticket to Player Support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
