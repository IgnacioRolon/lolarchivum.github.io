I think Aram has been unbalanced for awhile within 4 minuets in the last 3 matches we lose our first turrent 8 minuets we lose our second 10 minuets in we lose all 4 turrents and each member by then refuses to FF after all 4 turrents are down and are 6/15/5 kills, deaths, assists and are feeding hard. \r\n\r\nIn every game I play the story of Aram is always the same cycle, either we get hard stomped within 10 minuets, a very toxic player appears rages and brings the entire team to a stand still, or we have a 4v5 afk, either of those situations are very common place that and we lose all objectives and the game is unwinnable by any stretch of the imagination.\r\n\r\nEach and every game riot seems to match me with enemies who have a much higher MMR than I do even if its a hidden MMR I could be 214 wins 236 losses the enemy could be 250 wins 200 losses they are already up in terms of how many games won and how many games lost the maths is simple there better than I am or could ever be, but yet I get the same games where I'm matched with a Master Yi who then goes and gets him self a Quadra Kill and walks away with another 10 games at a 50% win rate average under his belt he is happy, while I'm stuck here hard losing team is toxic and hard feeding which we all do sometimes I get the nature of Aram is random but it doesn't seem random at all when over a 650 games played most of it is the same story as I have said before.\r\n\r\nCan riot tackle this problem and match me with a person or a team of enemies who are the same 214 wins 236 losses level 173+ instead of level 50-110 players Bronze 3 smurfs.\r\n\r\nLeague of legend is a game I wouldn't recommend now days since you can go play Super Mario and win consecutively and enjoy any other game with a non competitive E sport Edge, although I couldn't legitimately call someone sitting in a chair pointing and clicking a sport, but there are games where the environment is milestones ahead of this game where its unfair at best with how matches are made and lost effectively.","replies":[{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2020-02-29T01:49:35.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lmao its aram","replies":[]}]}
