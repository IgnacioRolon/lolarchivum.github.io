I'd rather they just skipped Star Guardian _(or anti-Star Guardian or whatever)_ altogether _(after the last 2 months of PROJECT and Arcade, I would genuinely prefer not to have Star Guardian this year.)_\r\n\r\nSomething is clearly wrong with the way Riot approaches events, when you're actually praying they don't release one of your favourite skin lines...\r\n\r\nWe have had back to back grinds the last two months, and before the latest one even finishes they're showcasing yet another one.  Is this actually going to turn into a literal 1/4 year-long token grind?\r\n\r\nWe all enjoy events, Pool Party was always fun, Odyssey was fantastic.  But everything needs to be in moderation.  I can't speak for anyone else, but I've enjoyed 0 events this year, because they and their content are forced down our throats.\r\n\r\nPlease Riot don't ruin the fun of skin lines by making events an obligation rather than a bonus.","replies":[{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-08-25T19:56:25.095+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"oh no, I do not like free stuff, oh no, oh my, they are physically controlling my hand to play in event modes, oh no","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-08-26T02:42:18.489+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> oh no, I do not like free stuff\n\nWhat free stuff?\nThe free stuff you purchase with tokens earned from a pass that you have to pay for?\nOr the 1 free Border or Chroma that you earn with the tokens you get from missions, that you can only use on a skin _you have to pay for_?\nRiot is a company not a charity, they don't just hand out free stuff willy nilly, everything is a business strategy _(or else it wouldn't exist)_.\n\nYou can't fault them for that.

'Psychologically' perhaps is closer to the mark.  Because they do pressure you to play:\n\nSay you're an Irelia main, or a 1-trick even.  If you don't get that prestige skin now, you will never, NEVER have it with that border included, the same with the normal PROJECT: skin.  Once the event is over, that's it, no more. _**Forever**_.  You'll go the rest of your life knowing that you'll never ever be able to complete your Irelia collection, it doesn't matter how much you play, or what rank you are.  Nothing you could do, will ever bring those limited things back.\n\nThats a fair bit of pressure for someone who is invested in the game, particularly those who play champions who receive event only limited content.\n\nIf you don't play Irelia, or don't care about loading screen flairs.  Then you're a lucky man.\nBut a lot of people do play Irelia, and a lot of people do care about loading screen flairs. _(why else do people grind out ranked for that gold+ border?)_\n\nSo yes, in that way, they do psychologically pressure you into playing the game.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2019-08-26T05:04:15.810+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seriously wish people would understand this more, just because it doesn't affect you, doesn't mean your the one it's ultimately intended for, and the people it is intended for, well it's not fun at all for them.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-26T10:33:57.850+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It all comes down to that perspective.\n\nThere are various reasons for the lack of care many have. Maybe it's because money is no issue and so the asking price for the $ cost of the tokens is a non-factor. Maybe it's because they have heaps of time and are heavily invested in League and so the time + $ price of just the pass isn't too much to ask because they'll get there just by playing as they normally do. Maybe it's because they just don't want the content for whatever reason.\n\nRegardless, that fundamental perspective means that unless they actually sit down and think about it from the other side, they will fail to see a problem every time.\n\nPersonally, I'd say I'm somewhere in the middle. I have more of a problem with Prestige skins being used to push loot boxes (as token bundles) than I do with the Prestige skins themselves, but I also acknowledge that I'm going to very conflicted if a champ like Nami gets a Prestige skin.\n\nI also work with Pop!

It's close to $60 when a new skin bundle comes out these days _(that's like buying an Assassin's creed game right off the bat)_, and if you're a main for that champ you HAVE to fork out that money because they don't sell the components separately like they used to, and in a week or two, some of those components will never return.\n\n> ultimately we speak with our wallets\n\nObviously I can see the logic in this, but unfortunately it's an idealistic view, in reality it doesn't usually work well.\nTheres always someone willing to spend the $$$, and theres always enough of those people to continue fuelling the products.\nPeople have been voting with their wallets for decades, and the forests are still being cut down for palm oil, animals are still being battery farmed in tiny cages, the oceans are gathering more and more plastic.\n\nTheres always people willing to do it, and therefore the rest of us just suffer without the products and ultimately nothing changes.\n\nAnd when something does change, it's like the eternals for league, they lower the price by double digit RP, give us a couple of days of BE sales for the shit tier ones only, and now they're in the clear because they 'listened to the community'.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-27T07:19:15.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Obviously I can see the logic in this, but unfortunately it's an idealistic view, in reality it doesn't usually work well.\n\nUltimately, boards is a vocal minorty, even the bigger boards like NA. Hell, even Reddit doesn't account for a substantial chunk of the population that plays League. Such places are congregations of the passionate players, and while these groups are very important, they aren't the be-all and end-all.\n\nThis applies to basically everything. The people that speak out on things are the ones that care the most. The quiet majority won't always agree, or care enough to do anything about it even if they do, and we need the help of that majority to make change.\n\nIn the meantime, every little bit helps. If every person who sees it as an issue just says \"well if other people aren't going to do anything, I might as well not\" then nothing will *ever* change.\n\nLarge-scale change is slow, that is the reality, but ultimately change does happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-08-27T11:11:22.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> If every person who sees it as an issue just says \"well if other people aren't going to do anything, I might as well not\" then nothing will ever change.\n\nYeah.  That is the heart of the issue right there.\nBut there will always be those people, there is nothing anyone can do to stop that.  No one wants to suffer for nothing.  and unless theres a certainty _(or a least a reasonable chance)_, you won't get enough people to stand strong.  As it stands currently, no one even _knows_ if other players ARE boycotting content or not.  It's not like a miner's strike, where those who give in have to to duck stones being thrown at them on the way to work.  Apart from the small community on the boards or reddit, no one knows if other players are unhappy, let alone willing to strike.\n\nSo why would you strike, under those conditions?  You'd be a fool.\n\nEvidently I am, because:\nI boycotted prestige Akali _(the one prestige skin that I was seriously interested in)_, because of how 'special' they said Kai'sa was, and then literally the next week they bring out another one.  \nAnd look how that protest worked out for me...  Theres a new 'super fantastic ultra-rare' prestige skin practically every patch, and now I don't have the one skin I would have actually used.  I achieved nothing, and now miss out because of it until the end of time.  Do I regret boycotting it?  Yes.  Quite frankly I do.\n\nI do regret it, but I still haven't purchased a single prestige skin since.  \nI like to think i'm pretty steadfast with these things, but I have absolutely no doubt that as soon as they release a skin for Air/Sol/Taliyah/Swain/Kindred etc.  I'll abandon my morals and jump through whatever hoops they tell me to, as many times as they want.  So if they can make someone as outspoken as me, their puppet with a snap of the fingers, what real hope do we have that enough of the community will (a. even bother to strike in the first place.  or (b. not share the same weakness as me?\n\nThe people who say _\"well if other people aren't going to do anything, I might as well not\"_, are absolutely right. \nWe might hate them for it, but ultimately, (and unfortunately), those are the people who win in the end.\nWhen no meaningful changes happens in time, and the rest of us go without.\n\n> Large-scale change is slow, that is the reality, but ultimately change does happen.\n\nYes of course, I agree with this. _(which is why I still generally avoid prestige skins)_.\nBut League isn't the ocean, or gender inequality, or gun laws.  League has a limited lifespan, and if change doesn't occur quick enough, who knows when breaking point might hit.  Like JasonWazza said, it happens to so many games. \n\nPokemon Go, for Honour, No man's Sky etc.  Change didn't happen quick enough, and all of a sudden, the games go from being the biggest thing, to a ghost town.  I like league, it's taken some bad turns over the last year or so, but I still really like it as a game.  And I'd like to avoid it taking that road.\n\nSo Riot are going to have to not just _follow_ the desires of the community, they're going to have to predict it and get ahead of it.  If change takes too long, there may no longer be 'desires of the community' to follow.\nPersonally they have to be quicker to react.  These 'eternals' were a good example of them reacting to the community, how much of that was pre-planned I don't know, but it's still good.  The price change was pretty token really, but it's something at least.\n\n________________________\n\nContrary to the content of this post, I'm not just doom-mongering here.  I don't think league will ever die overnight.  \nBut (from my perspective at least) it's been on a downward path this past year, with rushed short term balance changes, being unable to buy anything meaningful in the shop without loot boxes or large paywalls, and of course these non stop obligatory events.  And for a game I like so much, it's panful to see.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2019-08-27T08:11:07.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While i'll agree that the boards community is a vocal minority, i think the things that people miss is there are two non-vocal portions (especially F2P games) the non-vocal minority (People who are called Whales in the eyes of corporate shit bags) and the non-vocal Majority (non-whales, that will always be the majority)\n\nIn the end, the non-vocal Majority historically leave a game without any words, and are just gone, and usually while not vocal about it, agree with the vocal minority, and once these people leave, and leave only the whales, it's a bad time, because the Whales don't want to play with only other whales, that's not the point for them.\n\nI'm sure League is probably feeling the crunch of these changes hitting their player base, and they need to start listening to the people trying to help them right the ship, or they are just gonna die.\n\nSure it'll be slow, but does that really make it a good idea?\n\nI've been gaming way too long, and seen this happen to so many games, TFT is a way to get some people in-flowing, but it's not going to help League itself in any real measure, and riot really needs to think about what they are doing.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-27T11:00:39.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't disagree, but I also don't think I'm all that qualified to comment further.\n\nLeague is the first MMO I had/have any kind of heavy investment in.
