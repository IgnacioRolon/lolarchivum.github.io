While it's hard to deny that most of these champs aren't more unique than they were, or at the very least now give the player more to do or think about, it's likewise hard to deny that some were overtuned to the point systematic nerfs were required to get them back into line.

Yes the problem is they weren't as interesting to younger players as Zed/Yasuo, but the problem there lies with Zed and Yasuo, not with everyone else.

He still only has 19 voice lines, and his abilities still look dated as fuck. So in the near future he is going to need ANOTHER update to bring him back again. They might as well have bitten the bullet and given him a Ryze style update straight of the bat. \n\nAs for the updates of Syndra, Anivia and Veigar, none of them needed updating, none of them feel different to play after the update.

You think every champ should be as simple as Annie or WW? Cause that's basically what you're asking. Riot wants each champion to feel unique, and to have their own place. A specific strength that no other (or at least very few other) champions have, and I think they succeeded in that, and I couldn't agree more with that point of view. I would much rather a roster of interesting champions like Yasuo or new Zyra than I would a roster of simple champions like WW and Annie. The simpler champions have their place, but this game would get stale fast if there was little skill or playstyle matching involved in learning a champion.\n\n> But just buffing the crap out an already fairly healthy champion like Brand or Vel is not a viable method to give them attention.\n\nBrand was overtuned, but is far more interesting and has more mechanics to play around than he did before. Do I think he needs a bit of a nerf to certain aspects of his kit? Yes. Do I think he was **healthier** before? No. Brand was a champion that either did really well or complete trash before his update, and whichever it was he was not fun to vs nor did he promote healthy, skilled and balanced gameplay.\n\nAs for Vel'Koz... I play a lot of Vel'Koz and if anything he is weaker than he was before not stronger. With the reintroduction of his passive stacking on his ult I feel he is in a very good place, but he is not stronger than he was before, and his gameplay is healthier. Less utterly oppressive when he is strong while still rewarding skilled plays.\n\n> He still only has 19 voice lines, and his abilities still look dated as fuck\n\nGameplay updates and visual updates are handled by completely different teams. Yes he is in need of a VU, tho not as much as many other champs, and I'm sure he will get one eventually, but his visual state is irrelevant to his gameplay state sop I'm unsure what your point is here.\n\nThe reason they do VUs and GUs together for bigger projects like Ryze is because A. Ryze needed both and the timelines lined up nicely and B. The cooperation between teams meant his visuals all worked out thematically, without having to tweak or add new visuals in the process of updating his gameplay. \n\nThere is absolutely nothing stopping Malz from getting a VU without a GU. (See Kassadin, Alistar, Karthus, Twitch etc.).\n\n> As for the updates of Syndra, Anivia and Veigar, none of them needed updating,\n\nThey weren't intended as full gameplay updates as much as they were small scale quality of life upgrades to emphasise strengths and identity. \n\nSyndra W was a mechanic often overlooked, taken only as the damage it caused with the slow largely ignored, so what exactly is wrong with offering Syndra that greater opportunity for play?\n\nAnivia for was old and her balance mechanics outdated, but overall her kit was healthy. The few small changes they gave made her fit better in the current environment (meta aside). \n\nAs for Veigar, his ult was problematic. After the changes to his stun he was in a much healthier place, but his ult meant he was a nightmare vsing anyone AP and incredibly lackluster vsing someone like Zed or later game literally anyone except his AP mid opponent and maybe the ADC. His new ult means he has much greater choice on who is worth ulting. There is much more value to that decision. If he needs to kill the tank he can, but it may cost him a kill on a carry if he doesn't play it well, but he still has the option to ult the carries.\n\n> Zed/Yasuo pick rates just went higher\n\nSimply a result of the meta which we as players create. It's an Assassin meta right now, and theoretically the Assassin update (presumably the second last of these big updates) will restore some equlibrium to the meta as far as picks are concerned. Just as the Juggernaut update create problems, the Marksmen update corrected for them.\n\n> when we do see a mage, they're now unhealthy for the game.\n\nA few I would consider unhealthy, Vlad for example, but I would also consider Irelia unhealthy in the present top lane meta, or Jhin in bot lane, and that's not because of an update. I'd consider assassins far more unhealthy at present.\n\nDo I think the balance team is perfect? Hardly. In fact I think they make mistakes like the human beings they are (and at the very least always for a valid reason), but I don't feel the updates were a bad thing. Not all of them were strictly  necessary, but all of them were welcome in my books. Champs like Vlad will slowly be brought back into line as they always are, just as Swain and Malzahar have been. \n\nIn fact, I'd say the game right now is balanced better than it has been in a good while. My only problems at the moment lie in assassins like Fizz and Zed and how utterly oppressive they are when they get even a little fed, but surprise surprise assassin update is next (and presumably supports will follow, though I think for the most part any support changes will be small QoL stuff like Syndra/Vel).\n\n___\n\ntl;dr The updates aren't so much about interest, (though it certainly takes a part in determining direction, a champ has to be fun to play after all) but rather about gameplay health both present _**and future**_. Healthy gameplay is about more than just how much a champion is played or how strong they are.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-19T09:48:13.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually most of it is about power, Azir had a huge pick rate, then they nerfed his damage (nothing to do with his play, that is identical to what it was before) and suddenly he is never seen at all in any tier of play. A few people, like myself play champs for the champion, most people just play it for power.\n\nNo I'm not asking for every champ to be as easy as annie (and none of the mid year mage updates were ... except maybe Vel) \nBut strangely enough, Azir, and Taliyah and Yorick and other interesting champs are LESS picked than Annie and WW... so yea... back to power trumps everything.\n\nThe game was way more balanced before the mid year mage update, and the assassin one is most likely going to push everything over the edge.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-08-19T13:57:01.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Azir, Taliyah etc are less played because their learning curve is much higher. You have to put more time in them to be comfortable with them in ranked, so a far lower population of players are comfortable with them in ranked, hence lower pick rates. That trend will exist whether they are strong or not.\n\nJust because balance and champion health is influenced by power doesn't mean power is the **only** influence. People will always play what's strong, it's the same in any game. It's the same in WoW, same in ESO, same in DotA etc. but it doesn't mean those champions have to be unhealthy.\n\nAs for balance itself, somewhat subjective, especially dependent on what rank you are playing at. Nijiiyo for example has a Diamond perspective, while I have a Gold one and yours is different again.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-19T23:58:40.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For much of this year Azir had pick rates equal to that of Ahri and Ekko and Zed, and i believe he was 100% pick or ban in high elo as well. and now after a single nerf, he's back in the 2/3% again. \n\nIm not saying power is the only influence, but its the one most people care about, Annie and Yi are two of the most boring champs out there. Yet they are played a heck of a lot more than a lot of the more interesting less powerful ones. In my mind _(and it could just be my silver perspective)_ that isn't balanced. True balance would be the freedom to pick whatever champion you want without the fear that one is more powerful than the other.\n\nI frequently get told in ranked NOT to pick Aurelion Sol, (one guy went as far as to ban him just so I wouldn't pick him), even though i have a 70% win rate on him, and would only ever pick him into a team that doesn't counter him. \nBut i bet no one has ever banned Annie or Yi from their own team before.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-08-20T06:20:48.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't disagree there, I would love if all champions were as equal as possible, and were subject to counters only in the mechanics of their kit, and not in the strength of it. It comes and goes for different champions, but I take your point. \n\nMy initial argument was against your criticism of the MYMU, but this is a point I can agree with you on. Unfortunately with 132 (?) champions now, it's never going to be perfect. Do some champs need more love than others? Sure, but with that large a roster things will never be perfect. \n\nI take your point about most people picking for power, but I still see Graves and Karma (9%~ pick rate), Zac and Trundle (6%~) and Syndra and Kennen (4%~) and they still do really well. If you know how to play the champion, then the balance is still there.\n\nIn fact Zyra only has a 4.3% pick rate (these are all from lolking) and I'd say she's still pretty strong (though not unhealthily so)\n\nAzir looks weak to me not because of 3.3% pick rate but more because of the 42.8% win rate. Rammus for example has a 3.5% pick rate, but a 51.3% win rate, and I wouldn't consider him too strong or too weak. Even Aurelion has 51.1%, he just doesn't fit very well in the current meta of assassins and control mages.\n\nTo use your specific example, I do think Azir is too weak as it is, but pick rate doesn't tend to accurately reflect a champion strength, not when there is information that does it much better.\n\n(and tbh I would totally ban a Yi if we didn't have a tank/engage top laner :P )","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-21T09:52:35.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see what you mean, Im guessing that the reason some of those powerful champs are not picked is because they don't make the player feel 'special'.
