EVERYONE in this server has ziggs (partially because we all got gifted him at the start) but that means he is in far more games than say Yorick. I have seen Yorick in aram probably twice in my whole lol lifetime, and one of these was me.\nso lets just enable all champs on aram and so there is a even chance of getting any champ. is not all &#039;Random&#039; all mid if its only randomised between a few champs. it also prevents people who only play aram starting a new account and only purchasing Ziggs, xerath, jayce, nidalee ect.\n\ni know this has been considered before, but why did it not reach the live servers? what were the issues?","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-09-30T14:51:33.256+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey yeah you're right","replies":[]},{"poster":"DamnationsHound","date":"2015-10-01T04:55:11.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ARAM gives you a random champ out of those you own and the current rotation.
