Kassadin's attire seemed to be rather not matching the culture of the region as I know it.\n> \n> That was before I realized that the art contained stars, many stars. The stars appearing on his costume and in the background suggested to me that the skin is meant to be very celestial inspired. Certainly stars are not uncommon on the flags of the region (particularly the Southern Cross), but that's not really anything special. In that case, we have to look at the cultures of indigenous peoples.\n> \n> I first looked at the Maori people of New Zealand, already knowing they have some folklore around the stars and have used them to navigatre the oceans way back in the past. I did some light digging and found this: http://www.astronomynz.org.nz/maori-astronomy/taatai-arorangi-maori-astronomy-2.html\n> \n> For Australia, this: http://astrogeo.oxfordjournals.org/content/47/5/5.27.full \n> Papua New Guinea has some mountains called the Star Mountains. That's all I was able to find quickly.\n> \n> Most other countries in the region are small island nations, which probably at least used the stars for navigation. Astronomy is therefore likely an appropriate theme for Oceania, though I await further information on the skin.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-30T08:17:46.758+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It may be relevant, but it's just as relevant to several cultures around the world as to us, this is a lazy fucking attempt to do anything that is OCE related.\n\nThis is 2 years in the making, and honestly it's a pretty lazy skin where they have gone \"Stick the Southern cross on it and someone will make up some shit as to how it's OCE related.\"","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"x hellokitty x","date":"2015-09-30T08:37:08.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I'm not really seeing a connection to Australia, NZ, Papa New guinea or any of the tropical islands. There seems to be no cohesive element aside from \"stars\"? Even then that ha no real connection with any of the other countries. They have about the same in common with any other country in the world. Pretty poor effort tbh. My biggest suggestion would be adding more of an ocean element. The majority of OCE lives next to a coast. Yet I see nothing that reminds me of summer beach days or anything OCE related. ","replies":[]}]}
