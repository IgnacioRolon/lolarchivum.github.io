The shop then makes more money from people buying something extra that they weren't intending to, then they lose by selling a product at a discount.\nHowever the shop also runs the risk that people who went into the shop purely to buy the discounted item, and do not buy any additional items, will benefit more from the discount than the shop will.\nIts seems unsporting to reduce any risk to the shop itself.\nSo saying _\"These items are discounted, UNLESS thats the only item you came into the shop to buy.\"_ is rather an unfriendly move, and hardly inspires trust from the consumer.\n\nIt may be selfish of me to say this but:\nSeeming that the Esports mega bundle requires you to buy **27** skins just to get a 50% off deal, it think its fair that for people who already own 25 of those 27 skins (and bought them at full price on release) that the 50% off deal would still apply to the whole bundle. \nThat seems more than fair to me.\n\nHowever my whole point is rendered mute by the fact that upon seeing your reply, I have bought the two skins. \n\nThanks for clearing it up :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2016-09-27T02:29:32.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think Championship Zed skin gets a discount since it is a new skin, like how when a new champion is released now, their release skin bundle makes the champ half price but you still pay the full 1350 or 975 RP for the skin. It is misleading yep, but that's how Riot does their bundles. My only guess as to why the bundles stay the same price is that maybe wards/summoner icons in the bundles if there is any.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nocterus","date":"2016-09-27T01:02:59.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"having similar problem, discount is apparantly only 21% and even then its the amount displayed is more than it should be...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-09-27T00:40:15.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dont even play the game tho will get the championship bundle","replies":[]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-09-26T21:15:41.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so is championship zed out now?
