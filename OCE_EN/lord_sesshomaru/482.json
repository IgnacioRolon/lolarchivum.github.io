The same with Zac, the Zac chroma is probably the best of them all, but it isn&#039;t as good as Pool party Zac, both Pool party Zac and PROJECT: Zed were highly anticipated skins and while their chromas are good they cant compare to highly sought after skins like those two. it would make more sense to sell the lesser skins first and then bring out the good ones.\r\n\r\nalso it is my opinion that the time between announcing the skin/champion and releasing it is too long, people are really hyped about it for the first week but in the second (and in projects case, third) people lose a bit of interest. i would have the delay at only a week, maybe a week and a half at most. i know personally there have been many skien that i was going to buy as soon as they came out, but as time stretched on and the skin became less new (if you know what i mean) eventually when it came out i was like &quot;nah maybe not&quot; and also you enjoy the skin less too because you are already accustomed to it before it even came out.\r\n\r\nanyway i know what I&#039;m saying is pointless because you have a whole marketing division that spends their entire time working this stuff out, and so would have reasons for the length of time, but I&#039;m just speaking from my experience and from experiences of other people i know, we would have bought more skins if they were released sooner, or announced later, (either way)","replies":[]}
