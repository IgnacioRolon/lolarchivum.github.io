His Q proc&#039;s on hit effects like a basic attack.\r\n\r\n2. When you devour an enemy, you do more damage the longer you hold them in your stomach, (The current damage he does would be the maximum, and any less time spent in the stomach does less damage) \r\n\r\n3. If you have grey health and you swallow an ally, the heal applies to the ally instead of you, (this heal is applied per % of grey health not the amount of health, this is to stop you healing your adc for 2000 hp if you have heaps of hp) \r\n\r\n4. [this change could be instead of the previous] when you swallow an ally they become invulnerable (not affected by DoT like ignite while in your belly)\r\n\r\nThe reasons behind these changes are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. This isn&#039;t a very good reason, but his Q just feels like it should proc on hit effects, i cant explain it. \r\n\r\n2. Watch whenever a Tahm kench devourers someone, they always hold the enemy for the full length of time, been though it has no added effects, and often leads to tahm taking more damage than he needs to from enemy team-mates because of the strong slow. Also because of the slow, you cant really just eat your opponent and run back into your team like skarner, you can take he enemy roughly the length of a flash, but thats now that useful, there are knock backs/pulls that do more than that. so really the only advantage of holding an enemy is to keep them out of the fight for a few seconds, unfortunately it tends to keep you out of the fight as well because, you cant run back into battle 1 because of the slow and 2 because you dont hold an enemy long and you don&#039;t want to run in and deposit them back into their own team. so you really have time for 1 Q and thats it, so why not make him do increased damage the longer you hold an enemy, that way he still makes himself useful during a fight, and gives you a reason to hold them it, it becomes a trade off, more damage to the enemy but riskier for you because you are slowed for longer.\r\n\r\n3. Again this is just a feel thing, and i cant rationalise it. But i do think it would be a cool feature, and could make interesting plays, like if the adc is low hp and needs to B tahm could intentionally lose lots of Health in order to keep his adc in lane while he goes b instead.\r\n\r\n4. So many times I&#039;ve swallowed or seen someone else swallow an ally out of a team fight to save them, and a second afterwards their lifeless body falls out of yours, because they had ignite or malefic visions etc. This will prevent that.","replies":[{"poster":"Danasko","date":"2015-10-10T16:41:14.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would love to see these changes personally and i agree with all of them except maybe the on hit proc through q ( imagine iceborn gauntlet tahm). The changes would make tahm very versatile and more interesting honestly but sadly i doubt we will see these because of Tahm's impact on the professional scene. He is already quite strong when played correctly proved by his map control and saving capability. Riot only makes changes to champions that have an unhealthy playstyle or damage not because a champion is unpopular. eg. Galio, Singed etc","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-10-10T02:04:45.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah pick Kali and Ult them back into your team once your Tahm eats someone (Can drag them full length of Fate's call plus cast the dash back behind turrets or way into your team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-10-09T23:19:51.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Once hyped new release that no one plays anymore\" to be added to lore.","replies":[]}]}
