I took a hiatus from league, remade an account and started playing.\n\nFor someone read to shut my lack of knowledge down you seem to miss the obvious point. It's not his LANE stunning that is retarded, its his ability to roam / aoe stun from no where via Brush and Fog. You miss the point entirely, it's synergy with team is too strong... Pair it with Dianna, Lee Sin, Shaco, Evelynn etc.... Unless you're entire team has your 1/3rd of the map warded, you will eventually get camped by taric and friend in fog/brush and stunned before you can do anything.\n\nTrying to attack my credibility is just immature. I'm almost certain i could bring up more knowledge of the games history and lore than you if i really wanted to. \n\nThis isn't a pissing contest or to see who's bigger. \n\nTo make it clear again, i dont do ranked for two reasons at present- im on a bit of a potato, some team fights can drop me down to 25fps and freeze for a split second or two... Not the biggest impact, but can be frustrating at crucial moments. 2nd reason being, this account recently only just got to 30, why would i be playing ranked without 3/4 complete dedicated rune pages for roles? Tanking, fighters, ap's, adc's? it's obvious with my mix of runes i literally just bought the on special cheapies and, fixing around some t2 runes till i can build up the RP and WANT to dump a good 11-12k ip on it... 420 a rune, x9 per section, x3 + 3 quints... averagng 1050 a quint, not for speciality like crit damage etc. \n\nQuick to abuse me, not so quick to use that head for logical application. Sion is reasonably balanced, to be honest i think he's one of the more fun bruiser/tanky type that actually has fun mash up fight mechanics that has a balance of CC and damage without the CC turning good damage into extraordinary damage, however, Sion can only come out of no where with his ulti, taric can just use some move speed fog and brush and your dead without an escape or tanky items, which come mid/late anyways, your 1 tanky item won't really save you.\n\nOnly play aram? Hmmm yesterday was based off the fact of what? You checked my night history? Actually i play mostly the rift, but when medication kicks in and my head starts swimming i switch to aram as its less disappointing on teammates if i cant really focus (in which case i take a break after). Yesterday, since you want to know my life and abuse me lack of knowledge (which is clear your lack of knowledge of me is more of a missmatch than my views on taric), i was in a car accident yesterday where my 4wd was the meat in a car sandwich, i was pain killered through the eyeballs and in no way wanted to focus on the rift.\n\nBut hey, with all your knowledge, this is just me telling you something you obviously already know right? Cause i assume i know everything about you at a glance. \n\nI use morgana, i dont think her Q is over powered at all, its a skill shot root. I know its not a stun, her ultimate is a stun, her Q is a snare, which you W over... \n\nStop thinking condescending attitudes are how you teach or inform people, or how to make yourself look better online.

However, you still fail to see what i'm saying... support taric in lane isn't so bad an issue, its the synergy when roaming with dash/gap closing/stealth heros.
