But in my opinion while all those champions have ability power ratios they are negligible when it comes to adding power to their kits.\n\nHopefully these examples make sense. (I will be using the 30AP value from the old triforce)\n\n**Kha Zix** - First of all I probably wouldn't build Triforce or iceborn on Kha. Most bros build him full AD and a bit of CDR - http://www.probuilds.net/champions/Khazix\n\nBut previously if you got Triforce the AP would give +15 damage from passive and +15 heal on W. Once again these are minor bonuses and Kha would benefit much more from building AD.\n---\n**Gangplank** - Now Tri Force is definitely a core item for Gangplank. While the AP provides a nice small bonus it definitely does not screw him with the removal.\n\n30 AP gives + 27 health on W (but most of the healing is base + 15% Missing Health anyway)\n30 AP gives + 36 Damage on ult or 3 damage per wave\n\nThese are minor bonuses that AP Triforce gave, and I would definitely argue the + 10% CDR it gives now is much more valuable for GP. \n---\n**Gnar** - One again not a champion I could go triforce on. Most pros build him either tank and cdr or ad pen/tank and cdr - http://www.probuilds.net/champions/Gnar\n\nBut previously if you got Triforce the AP would give + 30 damage on Mini form W and + 15 damage on GNAR!. While its a nice small bonus W's main damage comes from the % max health component not the magic damage.\n---\n**Kog'Maw** - Tri force again a core build on Kog and previously the AP was good bonus for Kog. But now with Kog'Maws focus on W (doubles his total attack speed and attack speed cap for 6 seconds) I personally would move away from Triforce and more into Crit/onhit effects. (Try Blade of the Ruined King into IE into Runaans)\n\nI will be happy to go over in more detail about the other champions if you want. But long story short most of the champions don't get screwed by the removal of AP and probably benefit more from the CDR you get now.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-11-13T00:30:34.122+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You make very good points there, i know it isn't ideal to build it on Kha but I'm stubborn sometimes xD\n\ni guess my argument would be:\nif having the AP is so minuscule a thing on champs that like having it. then why not have both AP and CDR?\nif it does so little, then it shouldn't be a problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-11-13T00:36:43.894+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"That argument really goes back to the patch notes explanation.

Now has cooldown reduction.\n\nOne of the oldest items in the game, Sheen's ability power always made it a little awkward to use as a building block for other items (like Iceborn Gauntlet, which was always pretty confusing).

Like not exaggerating, there literally is no item for that anymore, so why bother even giving them an AP scaling?  you took lucian's ult's AS scaling away for the same reason. so will we see increased base damage/heal or something now instead of AP scaling on those champs?\n\nI'm sorry but i just cant see the logic of taking away a stat because one or two champions felt awkward about having something they didn't use, when other champs do make use of it. \nits like if two children each have a lollypop and a chocolate bar, if one of them doesn't like chocolate and doesn't eat it, is it fair to take the chocolate away from the other child as well?\n\nyou say \"adds more synergies for the champions who want the spellblade passive without forcing an often-'wasted' stat on them\" but what about champions that DO want the spellblade passive AND the AP?","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-11-13T22:09:12.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I mentioned earlier I don't feel like any champions want the spellblade passive AND AP except for lich bane users.\n\nIn my opinion Triforce and iceborn users are much better off with sheen being cheaper AND giving CDR instead.\n\nI can't really answer about if we are planning to remove AP ratios from certain champs as I don't work on the champion design team if you want to talk to them directly head on over to the dev corner or check out the ask.fm from our Design director - http://ask.fm/RiotGhostcrawler","replies":[]},{"poster":"demonicslothman","date":"2015-11-13T13:04:10.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i know that the new corki misses it severely as 1st or 2nd buy into tforce as now he gains now combat stats unless he goes phage 1st.
