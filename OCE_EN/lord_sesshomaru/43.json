When you want to win, you want as much edge on the competition as you can. Probably why I was never picked in dodge ball or the Aussie version of British bulldogs. I am the RL Urgot {{champion:6}}, just there to make the initial line up of numbers look impressive.\n\nCall Yas what you will, it is because he has so much strength and utility at his disposal (some would say an 'edge' over most other champs) that he becomes the default pick because said player does not want to lose. And when someone has had enough of losing lane to a Yas, they decide why try beat a Yas, when I can BE the Yas. And it snowballs over time to what we see now, a Yasuo in every single game.\n\nThe ironic part of it all, is that we see changes on game modes with quotes like it \"was stagnating super fast and had some unhealthy play patterns.\", \"Games quickly devolved into a slideshow of the 'perceived' best champs.\" and \"seeing the same 20 champs every game got boring REAL fast.\" and change it to suit.\n\nOf the 150 odd available champs in the game right now, we are still seeing the same champs every game.\n\nIt's not the game modes that are the problem, its the champions that are the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-09-12T03:03:55.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem here is that you're wrong on many fronts.\n\nUrgot is actually an AMAZING champion, with high damage while being quite tanky and a butt load of utility.\n\nYasuo has no utility.
