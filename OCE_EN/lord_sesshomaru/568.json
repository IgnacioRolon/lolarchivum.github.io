Blitz&#039;s lane usually gets firstblood due to his CC, then mid game his roams are so powerful, and his speed boost endures he gets there quicker than other champs. and in late game he is tanky enough to withstand almost anything. He has no weak spot time-wise.\r\n\r\nHis pull is powerful enough without needing to give him a knock up (that activates instantly after you get pulled so if you dash or flash it still knocks you up) AND a silence.\r\n\r\nI have seen (and experienced) on multiple occasions him 1v1 Adc&#039;s that were more fed and win (Adc&#039;s are supposed to be the ones that kill tanks not the other way around, (because god knows the other damage champs like AP assassins and mages certainly cant.)\r\n\r\nits not really fair that he has such powerful disruption, is so tanky, really mobile, AND does so much damage.\r\n\r\nHe has a 52% win rate (higher than almost all champs) and has a 17% pick rate (meaning that we experience that 52% win rate a lot)\r\n\r\nand i know that most comments here will just be &quot;oh blitz is actually easy to counter, and to fight you just .... and you can win&quot; But if it was that easy he wouldn&#039;t have a 52% win rate.\r\n\r\nthere is literally no other champion that makes you groan inside so much when he is picked in ranked.\r\nyou know this to be true.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Strat","date":"2016-02-21T13:38:06.650+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blitz is only powerful vs low Elo/inexperienced players. His kit utterly fails in the early game against competent players - he's extremely vulnerable to harass and finds it difficult to maintain lane control. The thing that gives him a high win rate in the early game is that he's good at setting up ganks (W in and flash+E or similar), but that can easily be countered by spending more money on wards. Smart players can more easily destroy a Blitz than they can other supports.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2016-02-20T13:36:56.208+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"no, he's not too powerful. he just has a lot of presence. you know who is too powerful? thresh. he has just as much presence as blitz, but instead of also pulling enemies towards him, he can bring allies to enemies.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-02-20T11:52:39.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And his whole kit is based on one ability.","replies":[]}]}
