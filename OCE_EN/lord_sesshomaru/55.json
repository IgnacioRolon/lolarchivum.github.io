But thats just me i guess.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-01-31T23:56:21.997+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Up to them how they climb.

Challenger solo queue / dynamic queue is completely different than team pro play in tournaments etc.\n\n2. Everyone says a champion is no skill, think carefully. Not a single champion in League takes skill in their kit. It is how you position and your game choices and knowledge that lets you win.\n\n3. One trick players have always existed, and always will. Everyone feels a connection to a character in games whether it's their lore, their kit, their fighting, whatever. Maybe this guy has a gay relationship with Tibbers or a hentai obsession with an 8 year old. Who knows.\n\n4. Players can play whoever they want really. Annie B0t is a professional Annie streamer, and one of the best Annie players in the world. He doesn't get flamed because he picks an \"easy\" champion. Every champion in the game is easy mechanics wise. Sure some players are better than others, but it doesn't take much mechanical skill to get down the basics of a champion. Even some bronze players can play Zed well, and that's because hes easy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-01T00:06:47.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That team would never be picked in Worlds and if it was then there would be an extremely high chance they'd lose.","replies":[]}]}
