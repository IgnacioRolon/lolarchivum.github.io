It just isn&#039;t done.\r\nPeople respect the jungler _(or whoever is taking the camps)_ and leave that camp alone once someone starts attacking it. _(i don&#039;t know why this applies to jungle monsters but not to lane minions, but thats just the way it is.)_\r\n\r\nSo what I want to know, is why 90% of the community doesn&#039;t show Ivern the same etiquette?\r\nMany times i have actually been mid-cast starting a grove on wolves or raptors or something _(like i am actually standing at the camp, performing the spell)_, and a Yasuo or Jinx or whatever will just walk up take the whole camp and leave, not even leaving me the big one.\r\n\r\nOr theres an obviously finished grove that i am walking to, and a Renekton or Zed will just take it on their way past.\r\n\r\nLike seriously? \r\n\r\nIm not having a go at anyone _(although it is bloody annoying sometimes)_ I am just genuinely interested as to why most people will follow this simple etiquette where other champions are concerned, but for some reason throw all manners out the window when theres an Ivern.\r\n\r\nIts just so weird. \r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-11-20T12:15:37.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.
