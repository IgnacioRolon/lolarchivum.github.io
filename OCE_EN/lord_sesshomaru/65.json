(and its not just our server either)\r\n\r\nThere are more Yasuo posts than Esports or Community events posts, and they have their own sub boards.\r\nSo i propose we get a specific sub board just for Yasuo and his bs. \r\n\r\nObviously Riot have no intention of listening to our queries about him, so its in their best interests as well to give us our own little corner for them to ignore.\r\n\r\nSo how about it? it is constantly one of the most talked about things on the boards.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-07-29T10:51:57.032+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There should just be a sub board titled \"Whiny little bitches post here\". ;^)","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-07-29T11:35:02.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes...
