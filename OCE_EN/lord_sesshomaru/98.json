No player in their right mind would stay in her pool and it takes 1 second to walk over and avoid. Likewise, nerfing the damage/ap scaling on her q would nearly make her an unviable choice in any other position other than support (which would suck), because once again, her pool is reliant on the q damage (pool does more damage with more missing health). **Morgana's entire kit relies on her landing her snare otherwise she is useless.** Also, it has an 11 second cool down, so realistically she can only go in every 11 seconds, unlike other midlaners like Orianna and Ahri\n \nLux is essentially the same. Her max Q cc is 2 seconds burt all of he spells have lower ap scalings due to her being a burst mage. She doesn't require her snare other than to hold enemies in place for her ult and to make sure that she can actually detonate her passive.","replies":[]}]}]}
