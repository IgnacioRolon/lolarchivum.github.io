Not quite what he was, but still not quite what he could be.\r\n\r\nIf you are going to rework champs, can you please actually put in time and effort equal to what you put into new champs.\r\nWould you be satisfied releasing a new champ with a playstyle that took less that 3 months of thinking/planning/testing?\r\n\r\n**No.**\r\n\r\nSo can you please treat existing champs with the same respect.\r\n\r\nPlease.","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-09-20T04:48:00.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I kinda like the direction they were going with his rework. Making the kit itself slightly less powerful so they had more space to play with the numbers without him being either useless or obnoxious. I'm guessing he will start weak after the rework but they will slowly buff his numbers. \n\nI know he's your baby Sesh but it seems like steps in the right direction for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-09-20T05:27:17.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I will admit I am sentimentally attached :P\n\nPersonally though, I think making him a damage machine is a waste.\nHe was released with such unique abilities:\n_Making a tower._\n_Changing direction mid dash._\n_Casting W on turrets._\n_Range extension on his AA's_\n_Terrain that is alive, and knocks back of its own accord._\nand so much more.\n\nBut they are slowly taking it all away piece by piece, just to make him do more damage.\n\nIt makes no sense, give damage to plain champs like Draven or Yi or Lux, who don't have much else going for them. Meanwhile we should focus on what is unique about Azir, and what is unique about him is all the neat little utilities he has. Damage isn't unique, anyone can have damage, but not anyone can have a wall that is alive, not everyone can create towers, not everyone can extend their basic attack range into zones. Why get rid of interesting and fun stuff just to put in one thing that all other champs have _(and many use better anyway)_.\n\nWhy take out such unique and interesting mechanics, just to pump him full of mundane, boring, damage.\n\nBut thats just my view.","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-09-20T05:35:19.282+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a tad :P\n\nAgreed. But I thought they were at least trying to do there best to tone down the kit without taking away parts of his uniqueness. Part of the problem with super unique kits is they tend to be OP or useless depending on the numbers. \n\nNow that I think about it though. Hurting his range, mobility and peel all at once might be a bad idea. I would have preferred for them to target his mobility first. Having a long range and self peel makes sense. Targeting it all at once seems a bit over the top.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-09-20T06:06:55.268+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Remember that the three years it took to make Azir had more to do with his visuals than his gameplay (at least to the best of my understanding), also we don't knwo what they are classifying as \"very early\". Very early to them could be \"We have loads of concepts that would work/fit but we have to filter it to the best and implement it\" or it could mean as we see it \"We've just started concepting\". They have said in the past they've been looking at Azir for a while, just cause a new kit wasn't in active dev doesn't mean stuff wasn't going around.\n\nThree months does sound hella short, but it could just be a communication thing. Not having ever played Azir, I'm not going to even hazard how well he will play with his new kit, since I couldn't even grasp his old one, but I'd still say *try* to withhold judgement until you actually get your hands on him. You can say whatever you like about balance but let's be honest, it's all just speculation until you actually get to playtesting.\n\nI know it's hard when a champ you love gets changes, I was so scared when they announced Vel and Anivia changes (though ofc they ended up being real small scale stuff) but let's not abandon hope before we even know if it's bad or not ey?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-09-20T07:10:13.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know theres much more that goes into a champ in development than just their gameplay. But I would be horrified if they spent 2.5 years designing the champion's look and personally and then the playstyle development was just an afterthought 3 months before release.\n\nA champ's playstyle is woven through their whole theme, Azir is an emperor, his loyal soldiers leap up with their shields and smack away enemies trying to strike down their leader. It makes sense. They feel like soldiers protecting you. \nBut now they are just terrain, they don't do anything, _(what kind of soldier lets someone jump over them towards their leader without trying to stop them?)_ they might as well just be a wall of sand, instead of soldiers.  It wouldn't make a difference, that small part of his theme is lost.\n\nAnd unless you're creating them both at the same time, you can't change one without affecting the other. Which is why I can't believe that 3 months is enough time to fully consider such changes to a champion.\n\nAnd by no means have I written off the changes! they might well be beneficial. I don't know, I haven't played him, But judging from their track record of other reworks.. Im not at the edge of my seat. So yes, it is speculation at this point, but educated speculation.\n\nThere hasn't been a single new champion that they have released _(in my memory)_, and then taken back and reverted most of their kit a few months later. Where they have done that to mini reworks _(Notably Kog and Malz)_.\nSo there is obviously some difference between kits designed over 3 years, and kits designed over 3 months.\n\nAnd no, I haven't played it yet, and I have avoided condemning the actual rework itself yet for that very reason.\nIm just condemning the time they put into it. It might well be a great rework, but the time they spent on it makes me sceptical.\n\nIt's the same reason you wouldn't want to live in an apartment building that was designed and built in a week.\nIt might be great! But your first instinct is to run away!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-09-20T10:56:49.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rework looks fine, wait till he's actually out before you make judgements.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2017-09-20T09:08:18.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIP Azir, ye shalt be remembered","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-09-20T05:44:37.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reworks like this are making me dread the Evelynn rework.
