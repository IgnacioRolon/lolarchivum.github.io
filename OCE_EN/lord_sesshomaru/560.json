This exact scenario has happened to me many times now, along with other similar ones like for example failing to land the Q slow to save a team member because the soldier veered out of the way.\r\n\r\nI have included a video illustrating my point, in the first instance 2 soldiers are on the field and then the third is summoned in front of Azir and Q is activated right on Lee sin, The soldier closest to Lee (and the last one summoned) dashes on an angle to allow room for the other soldiers to come in and as such misses Lee altogether and Lee sin simply walks out of the way of the others which take longer to arrive which means that having multiple soldiers on the field actually disadvantages Azir, The replay in slow motion is to demonstrate that the closest solder stops movement before Lee Sin even starts to move and you can tell by its range circle that had it gone where the curser was it would have struck the killing blow on Lee, The second scenario shows the same thing but with only 1 soldier (and lee was already running from the start) and you can see the soldier reached him and killed him due to it not moving out of the way for the other ones. this shows that having multiple soldiers on the field can be a major disadvantage which doesn't seem right to me seeming he depends on them so much, he shouldn't have to regulate how many soldiers he uses during a fight just so he has the option to chase afterwards, he should have to regulate them because of soldier charges and mana but not because he can't chase with multiple soldiers.\r\n\r\nIt seems common sense to have the closest soldier to the destination take the middle (optimum) position, but seeming that isn't the case there must have been a reason that wasn't implemented that i am unaware of \r\nand i was wondering what that is? but if there isn't a reason and it turns out that it was just an oversight or a bug could it please be mentioned to someone who could consider the change?\r\nthat would be much appreciated thanks :)\r\n\r\nalso on another semi unrelated topic in Azir's champion spotlight at the beginning there is the quote \r\n\"The name Azir shall once again crack the sky\" i was wondering what happened to that quote as it isn't said in game and it isn't in the list of his ascension game mode specific quotes, if it wasn't too much effort could it be considered to put that into the game because it is his best quote by far, if he said that at the beginning of a game that would be awesome, other champs like Karthus have beginning of game quotes too.\r\njust a thought from a huge Azir fan hahaha\r\n\r\nthanks for your time i know it was a long read","replies":[]}
