But i swear! the bad luck i have had in ranked this season is unreal O_O) So it does happen (but i am aware that every bronze player thinks the same.) \r\n\r\nbut that is my idea anyway, it gets anyone who shouldn&#039;t be in bronze a chance to escape the hellish teamwork down there, and it gives people who think they are better than they are a good wakeup call. \r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-05-12T00:26:19.466+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To me this idea seems to look to make silver the new bronze. If you have been playing for x number of seasons (assuming x is more than 2), if you aren't out of bronze you probably still need to be improving some of your skills a bit.\n\nBronze is hard af to get out of, with bad players, troll picks and teams that wont communicate.The thing is, it doesn't magically get better the higher rank you get. You will still get afks/intent feeders/potatoes in mid-silver +.\n\nI have been in bronze in all three seasons that I have played the game. Season four I was even placed in bronze 5, but managed to get out after taking a month of ranked to cram my head full of game knowledge and practicing mechanics in customs and norms. It just takes a lot of dedication to get out. \n\nYou best friend in this instance is probably dyanmic queue. Even though everyone is complaining about it, you should still use it while you can. Get a team together (or even just a duo) of trustworthy people that you know wont afk or feed, and climb out. If you are surrounding yourself with other players that \"are better than bronze and play at a mid-silver level\", it shouldn't take you that long to get where you think you should be.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-05-12T09:53:18.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have gotten to mid silver last season, the season before that i got b1, but had ark's in every promo, but this season it puts me straight back into the bottom of bronze.\n\nI legit have done everything you suggested, and it works, but I'm sick of spending the whole year working my way back up to be at the same position i was at last year just to be placed at the bottom again next season.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RHIN0","date":"2016-05-12T00:15:39.602+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"okay, you are in bronze for a reason. I am plat3 and i just spent a few days playing some games in bronze and i won every game. people don't get stuck in ranks because of noob teams, here is some logic to prove it.\n\nLets assume you are never going to be the person that makes your team lose (trolling, feeding, afk, etc) that gives your team 4 chances of getting a troll. But since the enemy team is guaranteed to not have you on their team, they have 5 chances. So by this logic, you will win more games due to afk/trolls than you will lose. If you are good enough to be a higher rank, over time you will climb to it\n\nHaving a 'get out of jail free card' will do nothing but make silver a worse rank.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-05-12T09:58:34.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're bragging about getting out of bronze easy when you're platinum? 3 whole tier's above that skill level.. and you're bragging? you serious?","replies":[{"poster":"RHIN0","date":"2016-05-17T00:20:46.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not bragging, im telling you if you are better than your rank you will climb","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-05-12T00:07:21.919+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"AHAHAHHAHHHAHAHHAAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAH no.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-05-12T06:34:21.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Put it this way, put pro players like bjergsen,faker etc in bronze.

Every season im put in bronze and i manage to climb to at least silver 2. In the preseason i even got to gold 4. Its just about how much time and effort you're willing to put in. If you're actually good then pick a hard carry champ like TF, Yi, or Lucian and just stomp everyone. Season 3 i was bronze 3, season 4 silver 4, season 5 silver 1-gold 4. Hopefully when i have more time to play i can climb to gold 1 or even break to plat. Every season i can see improvements but you need to start playing to IMPROVE. The problem with bronzies is that they blame everything on their team instead of looking at themselves. 90% of you dont even know how to play the role properly or why the roles exist in the way that they do. ADC is more than just 'do damage to ppl', support is more than just 'die for the adc', jungle is more than just 'ganking lanes', mid is more than just 'dicking on and outplaying your laner' and top is more than just 'an island'. If you say that getting out of bronze is all luck then you have a defeatist mentality and will stay a loser for the rest of your life. Im not trying to be a dick, but that's brutal honesty for you.","replies":[]}]}
