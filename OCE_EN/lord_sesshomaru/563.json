Only to later discover that Redemption and Ardent Censer both share the same UNIQUE passive of &#039;+10 heal/shield power&#039;.\r\nWhich means that Redemption&#039;s heal isn&#039;t affected at all when you buy Ardent Censer.\r\nWhich is kind of annoying, because any support that would by Redemption, probably has Ardent Censer on their buy list anyway.\r\nAnd unless you want wasted stats, it is inneficient to get both Redemption and Ardent Censer, which is a low blow to &quot;Enchanters&quot;.\r\n\r\nWhich means the only item that &quot;Enchanters&quot; _(I cant get over how terrible that sounds...)_ can buy to boost Redemption, is Mikael&#039;s Crucible. _(UNIQUE Passive +20 Heal/Shield power)_.\r\nThe problem being, that Mikael&#039;s is a very situational item to say the least. Unless you&#039;re against a heavy CC team with lots of AP, there are much better items for a support to buy. Which means that if you are against a heavy AD team _(which let&#039;s be honest, is most teams)_, you pretty much can&#039;t make full use of Redemption, because you&#039;d have to waste an item slot building Miakel&#039;s, meaning that Windspeaker&#039;s blessing is the only thing that boosts Redemption&#039;s heal, which means there is little difference between &quot;Enchanters&quot; and Tanks buying Redemption.\r\n\r\nI have 2 questions:\r\n\r\n1. Why?\r\n\r\n2. Is this the actual interaction these 3 items have? _(Mikael&#039;s and Redemption work together, Mikael&#039;s and Ardent work together, Redemption and Ardent **don&#039;t** work together)_ or am I missing something?","replies":[{"poster":"SulkingKING","date":"2017-07-01T00:55:48.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you have a UNIQUE passive that does not ALSO have a name, it will stack with OTHER items with the same UNIQUE passive.\nIt will not stack with itself, however.\n\nWhen you have a UNIQUE passive that does have a name, it will not stack with anything.\n\n{{item:3147}} {{item:3814}} {{item:3134}} {{item:3142}}  Stacks\n{{item:3147}} {{item:3147}}  Does not stack\n{{item:3156}} {{item:3155}}  Also do not stack\n{{item:3053}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3078}} Stacks and buffs its own stacking capability (For unnamed passive, and not for Steraks Fury passive shield.)\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"PinkGemDaddy","date":"2017-06-24T02:28:54.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see your confusion on why it would seem {{item:3504}} , {{item:3107}} , {{item:3222}} would not stack. However I would like to clear the confusion by stating that they do indeed stack and there is a difference between a named and unnamed unique. If a item simply has Unique on it you may not stack it only with itself, so if you were to buy 2 {{item:3504}}s then you would only benefit from the extra stats while {{item:3504}} + {{item:3107}} you get everything. The unique trait is given so that you simply dont by 6 {{item:3504}}s and call it a day. The only time this is not the case is when a unique has a name after it, such as cleave from {{item:3748}}  or  {{item:3074}} you would only benefit from stats when buying both. \n\nTLDR unnamed uniques just cant stack on the same item, named uniques cant be stacked at all","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-06-24T04:16:36.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well you learn something knew every day!\nThanks!\n\nSo in _theory_ I could get 50% bonus healing and shielding power from {{item:3504}} {{item:3107}} {{item:3222}} and windspeakers blessing?\n\nThen everything makes a lot more sense now, those changes make sense.\nThanks for that :)","replies":[]}]}]}
