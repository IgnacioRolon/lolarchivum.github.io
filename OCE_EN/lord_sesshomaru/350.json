I did have this happen to me a couple of times as well, where i was sure i was out of the range but still got hit, but i know its hard to judge exactly what happened or if it was an optical illusion, and i was sure that if it was a legitimate bug then RIOT would fix it. However It still hasn&#039;t been fixed which struck me as strange because it kept happening time and time again to me and people were still making posts about it.\r\n\r\nSo today i tested and recorded it, to once and for all put this myth to rest. \r\nand my findings conclude beyond a shadow of a doubt that the tentacles DO indeed strike targets outside of their hit zone indicator.\r\n\r\nAnd here is the irresputable proof in the picture, Gangplank is clearly completely outside the hit zone. \r\nTo reiterate: No part of his model is inside the zone or even touching it, there is a clear gap in-between where the boundary ends and where the outermost part of Gangplank&#039;s model begins, and yet the tentacle still strikes him.\r\n\r\nObviously this indicator is not working as intended. (either the particle&#039;s damage hitbox needs to shrink, or the indicator needs to grow)\r\nThis problem has never seen a riot response on any of the posts i have seen (across multiple servers) but now your player base has tangible proof, showing 100% that &#039;Clarity&#039; is absent here. You can no longer afford to ignore these problems.\r\n\r\nWe look up to you RIOT, and by no means do we don&#039;t expect you to run off and fix these things the instant we notice them, but we would like you to at least acknowledge these problems when they are found, especially after so many people have posted about it. Denial is not the solution.\r\n\r\nIts not a subjective issue like &quot;Garen&#039;s ultimate is too strong&quot; or &quot;I don&#039;t like Yasuo&#039;s Wind wall&quot; This is a legitimate provable error in the game, and one that does affect players.\r\n\r\nPlease.","replies":[{"poster":"Lunarcy","date":"2016-02-04T08:28:07.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason why GP is getting hit here is because his hitbox is still within the aoe of the tentacle. [Hitbox Sizes](http://www.team-dignitas.net/uploads/tinymce/images/sizes-edited.jpg).

That is effectively the same thing as this. Every object (excluding the shop) that can be interacted with has a hitbox. Now some of the hitboxes become visible (skillshot indicators) while other skill shots just have graphics (Nid spear, Blitz hook, etc) how ever some missile graphics extend outside their actual hitbox (Ez ult being one of them). It is these hit boxes which are used to determine line of sight and line of effect to other objects. The way the game determines if an effect hits or interacts with another effect or object is by collision detection. What that means is when two hitboxes meet the game checks what the two hitboxes are. If one is a unit and the other a damage effect (missile) then the game registers it is a possible hit and checks the properties of the missile to see if the missile can affect that unit and/or it passes through. E.G. A Nid spear will hit a minion that is standing in front of a champion but an Ez W will ignore the minion and hit the champion behind it. \n\nNow this is where champions and their hitboxes comes into it. There are 3 standard sizes used for champions (before spell or ability which affect size) Small (yordles, Annie), Medium (regular humans/humanoids), and Large (Big Ones aka Malph, Mundo, Hecarim). Each size is a fixed radius which extend a bit beyond most champion models (some rare models fill the entire hitbox), This ensures A) that there is no advantage for picking a small/thin model (Jinx compared to Graves) B) that missiles interact with units in a reasonably consistent manner. \n\nIf getting hit by skillshots by such a narrow margin is a problem for you then I suggest going into bots and look at the white ring around each champ, that is the size of their hitbox. Once you have a good grasp on that that you will recognise when a skillshot missile will or will not hit you. It is not a case of 'Did the missile hit my model?'.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-02-04T12:37:14.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know what a hitbox is and how they work thank you very much.\n\nI dont think you have understood the post at all.\nits not the fact that I'm being hit that is the problem its that the 'clarity' is absent. Regardless of what is at fault (be it tentacle or gangplank hitbox) it looks like it shouldn't hit, but it does, this is the problem.\nRiot puts the visual indicator there so you know that if you are on the inside of it, you're gunna get hit and if you're on the outside of it then you're not, but the whole thing is pointless if you are on the outside of it and it still hits you. This is what needs to be addressed, and its not like gp has his foot on the line or anything, he is a good distance away from it, i have had many skillshots miss me by less than that.\n\nWhy it probably isn't the hitbox:\npeople are constantly having this 'outside the marker' problem with illaoi's tentacles, but are NOT getting it on Fiora's Reposite\nnow assuming it was the hitbox that was the problem, people would have the same trouble with both, but they aren't, therefore logic dictates that it is most likely the tentacle marker that is at fault.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Darcy","date":"2016-02-04T05:47:51.996+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, a lot of indicators in this game are totally misleading and incorrect.
