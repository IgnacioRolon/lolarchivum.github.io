When was the last time you saw a 300,000+ {{champion:421}}  or {{champion:30}}  that played no other champion? and when you do see other high mastery champs, theres usually not much of a difference between that champ and the next highly played one.\r\n\r\nBut for some reason those 9 champs are more often than not the only champ that summoner plays. Why? (obviously there are exceptions, but more often than not it seems to be the case.)\r\n\r\nDo those champs just attract that kind of person, or are these champs just the most reliable champions to win with if you only want to play 1 champ?\r\n\r\nim interested to know why some champs are: &quot;either your an X champ main, or you never touch them.&quot; and others aren&#039;t, and why its generally those specific champs.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-07-30T01:34:03.177+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How fun a champ is, is the reason I would main them, if I had 300k ok karthus id probably kill myself","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-07-30T05:29:42.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"somones been requimed to many times.","replies":[{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-07-30T08:06:24.887+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CHEESYLEEKS,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=0WTB9fmb,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2016-07-30T05:29:42.305+0000)\n>\n> somones been requimed to many times.\n\nHaven't seen a karthus in game for months karthus is just a boring and tedious champ","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-07-30T11:27:18.967+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"each to their own\n\nhaving to play against the same champs over and over every game gets pretty tedious and boring.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-07-30T12:03:00.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to agree with you there, id much rather play with/against or as Karthus (which i often do), than play with/against/as Zed/Yasuo/Katarina/Lucian etc etc.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-07-30T02:12:56.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Id argue that Karthus is more fun than Master Yi though, or Katarina.

She has a few build paths (Got M7 with AD tank kat lmao). She's alot harder I hear at Higher ELO, so that stuff becomes more relevant as it goes up.
