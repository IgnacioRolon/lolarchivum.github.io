There's something about it that's not distinct enough. \n\n\nI've also noticed the contrast adjustments. It makes everything so bright and yellow. What is the point of that? The Alistar one just looks like a floating head.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-01-11T03:58:18.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont see a reason for the contrast things\n\nand with the ahri splash art its almost the opposite, almost every colour in the picture is of almost the same tonal value which just makes it look flat and uninteresting, also it looks like she is being grabbed by some furry octopus instead of having fox tails, the old splash art dispite having less detail was actually much clearer, the new one shows nothing of her 'seductive charm' from her lore, her facial expression makes it look like she just took ALL the drugs, and thats probably not the look riot should associate with their champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Sunlit Earth","date":"2015-01-11T07:00:39.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some of them were improvements I think. I always thought Lee Sin's newer icon looked more like an amputated leg with a face painted on it than a head or something. He was just... so... ugly.
