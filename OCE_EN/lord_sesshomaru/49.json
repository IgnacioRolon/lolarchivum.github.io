Her Q is already in the air when she E Ws. So if she had really good ping this might be possible, as a Rengar one shot someone in 0.1 seconds, so only 2 abilities is possible.

Although that is pretty dumb. Kat prob had all her skills on smart cast and face slammed her keyboard and randomly got her Q W E combo in 0.13 seconds. XD\n\nAlso,  Quick Answer.\n0.101 seconds is the current fastest reaction time recorded for human beings. The average reaction time of human beings is around .215 seconds. This is determined by the amount of time it takes for people to react when given the proper signal to click.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-10T19:26:41.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"0.101 is the fastest _recorded_ reaction time, 0.15 is the fastest _conscious_ reaction time. There is a difference and Im fairly sure you need to be conscious to play against kat.\n\nEven having all her skills on smartcast, it shouldn't be possible to destroy someone so instantly, there just is no counterplay.","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-06-11T02:23:43.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's not fprgwt that you probably knew kat was there before you took damage. So you'll need to take anticipation into account. Its pretty fucking easy to anticipate when she's gonna jump you","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-11T04:01:54.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lets pretend i did know she was there, and she didn't jump out of an un-warded bush, or over a wall that they had warded.\n\nWhat can be done? Lets consider the possibilities, she is about to jump on me, i am running away, but she has a higher base movement speed than most mages, so if we both have boots she still runs faster. \n\n1. I cant stop to slow her down, because as soon as you use an ability, your champion stops running (except for a couple of champs) and in that instant she will jump on you. \n2. I cant Zhonyas to stop her jumping on me, becasue she will stroll up to me, wait for it to finish and then execute me in 0.13 seconds. \n3. I cant hit her with any CC projectiles because again my champion will stop. and she will jump over them.\n4. i cannot kill her before she kills me, because any ability that i use will stop my champion walking forward and put me in range of shunpo, not to mention that the cast animation of most abilities (let alone the travel time) is longer than 0.13 seconds. \n5. I cant use any CC on the place that i predict she will land because that will cause my champion to stop moving, plus any cc that is ground targetable like that, almost always has a delay (vel e, Taliah W, Leo R etc etc.) and so she will have killed me long before the CC activates (and probably before its even cast as well) \n\nSo my only options are:\n\n1. happen to be a champion with a self movement speed buff that has no cast time and does not interrupt previous activities.\n2. have an ally, shield me for enough of her damage to allow me to survive (which is unlikely seeming she still had her ult up her sleeve)\n2. have an ally use a move speed buff on me.\n3. Be Kindred, Kayle, Ekko or tryndamaere.\n\nAnd incase you dint notice, i have no control over any of those options while running away from her.\n\nSo what should i do? Dying seems like the only option.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Corehog","date":"2016-06-16T10:48:03.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The counterplay is having some amount of extra health and magic resist so you can buy time to either get away or kill her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TsunamiNinja","date":"2016-06-16T09:24:26.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't let Kat get fed :^)\nBut really, unless Kat flash  EQWs or whatever combos you, you have more than the time it takes for the first instance of damage until death to react.\nThere are also plenty of other champs that do damage less fast but have less counterplay.\nAlso, a Soraka would help in that situation. That's counterplay.
