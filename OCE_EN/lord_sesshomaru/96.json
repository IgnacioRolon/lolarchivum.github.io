What is the cause of your losing streaks? What's happening throughout your games? What I would suggest is that if you are in a losing streak, how I do it is limit myself from two loses only and I take a break from it and do not continue playing. Players that do not take a break from their lost streak tend to bring that attitude from the last game to the next refreshed game of theirs so it is not a great mood. I also suggest doing a duo q with any of your friends or anyone else to reduce the chances of losing, overall a team game increases the likelihood of winning.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-03-08T08:11:12.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that just means you're where you should be. probably.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-08T11:56:22.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually i would personally say that his way to dependant on his team if this is the case, this doesn't mean his good or not.\n\nAlso he might be talking about normals, i just looked and the account is only level 9.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-03-08T08:47:00.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im basically 1 for 1 but id rather be 1 for 1 as in win loss win loss win loss, not loss loss loss loss win win win win.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-03-08T08:03:12.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Simply get better.
