So recently I&#039;ve just started doing the same, just ignoring it completely, and tbh I've been better off. (minus of course when it chased Azir halfway across the map)","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-11-30T06:30:14.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It has an Agro Bar like much of the jungle creeps now, whoever is closest to it has it's agro and each time that changes it loses some of it's bar.\nOnce the bar is depleted it will regen to full health.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-11-30T06:52:48.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea i know that, but why would it switch aggro between kha and darius (depleting its aggro bar each time) when neither of us moved the whole time?\nalso you can see in the picture that it is still following me even though it has already regenerated all the health it lost, shouldn't it return to its pit while regenerating?","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-11-30T07:31:04.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Likely you were switching agro the whole time, the agro bar wouldn't deplete otherwise.\n\nAs for the following, that seems to happen a lot with all jungle creeps thanks to the new agro system.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-11-30T07:52:03.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if we weren't moving though, how were we switching the aggro?\nlike legit question so i know not to do it next time.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-11-30T07:55:32.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should have one sit close and one sit at their max AA range.\n\nIf shit hits the fan you can swap.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-11-30T07:57:31.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ill give that a go then","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LemonHunter","date":"2015-11-30T06:15:18.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Harold just wanted to be your friend :(\n\nBut yeah, tweaking will happen as many changes have come into preseason, but I like the addition of the Herald.
