To outplay on someone like Quinn, you need to do it early into the laning phase or wait for team fights. The outplay happens 5 - 10 seconds before by not letting her engage, through good positioning and team play.\n\nYou wont outplay a bruiser in an **all in 1v1**, you need to hang back, poke, and get some peel from your team. \n\nYou don't need to get off 4 abilities either. Flash or w for your escape, even if she uses riposte you still get the dash. The problem is I'd imagine you were out of position and got caught out, so even if you flashed and used W, it wouldn't have made a difference.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-01-20T23:58:05.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"all of that is beside the point, and actually i wasn't out of position, but thats irrelevant anyway.\n\nmy point is that no champion with almost all defensive items should be able to 0.92 second another champ.

Literally by the time the cast animation for R has finished, i am dead.\nso i ask you, where the fuck is the counter-play in that?

You had your chances in the first 1 - 4 kills.\n\n> if a champions only counterplay is to gang up on them then they are broken from the start.\n\n+ She has more counter play than team fighting. Just that in your situation it was the best option. Going super sustain tank works well, also picking an even better 1v1 duellist should work.\n\n There's lots of champions like this though. If you want to kill a tanky bruiser, you're going to need more than 1 person. Most of these champions want to get into a 1v1 or 1v2, you're giving them exactly what they excel at. [Here](https://youtu.be/SLiTGQML3pI?t=3m18s)'s a Diamond YouTuber explaining how this works.\n \n> she destroyed in team fights, she just ulted the closest person, decimated them in 0.92 seconds and then spent the rest of the team fight dealing out true damage while being healed the entire time. (and we had some pretty fucking fed players, so it wasn't that we were behind.)\n\n+ Because you went to late game, and she was very fed. It's important to understand this. If you feed AP Riven to the point where she is level 18 and you are level 3. \n\n Guess what? She's going to carry. Doesn't really matter what you do.\n\n\nIf you're struggling against these guys, play really easy super sustain tanks. Your top lane picks aren't the best counters for tanky bruisers actually (Poppy is alright), but your support main is perfect. Taric with Grasp of the Undying and Q heals is crazy in low elo right now.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Blumpkin","date":"2016-01-21T00:38:03.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's riot what do you expect","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saturok","date":"2016-01-20T20:26:07.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Melee Carry/Assasin doing what they are designed to do?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-01-20T21:32:58.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lok at her build... she's a tank not an assassin in this case..","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-01-20T15:09:21.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i hate versing her, as soon as she builds {{item:3077}} i give up harrassing and focus farming, because its just pointless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-20T13:17:48.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my reaction time is averaged at 119ms, so im good.\n\nAlso, if fiora used w in her kill combo no you, means she actually killed you in closer to .17-.25 sec","replies":[]},{"poster":"normanzzz","date":"2016-01-20T12:35:54.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sad{{item:3070}} {{champion:114}}","replies":[]}]}
