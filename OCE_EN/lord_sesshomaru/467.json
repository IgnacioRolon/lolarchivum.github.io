These Homeguards in question have at least two aspects of their favourite champion, and it is up to you to tell us how they are helping defend Oceania against the Monsters.\n\n---\n\nWrite us a short story about who your Homeguard is. It could be about you as a Homeguard, or your friends/family as Homeguards. Tell us what they are like, and what abilities or aspects they have adopted from their favourite champion. The story can include as many Homeguards as you like, or  it can be about just a solo Homeguard. \n\nPerhaps you will tell us the story of a bot lane combo you and your friend usually play as, Ashe and Nami. Your Homeguards could be using waves that are frozen in ice to clear out massive clumps of Monsters. It could be the story of a solo act as an Assassin such as Akali, taking out key targets to win the war against the Monsters. You could even tell us the story of a full team of your friends banding together. It&rsquo;s really up to you.\n\nOnce you&#039;ve finished your story, submit it down below for us and others to read :)\n\n---\n\nThere are no rules on length or how &quot;overpowered&quot; your Homeguard can be, however do try to keep it interesting.

I see two parents, holding their children just slightly too close, as though afraid they might never see them again if they let go. And maybe they are right. \n\nI let the curtain fall and turn away, ashamed, unable to watch them any longer, and my eyes fall on the objects at the heart of my remorse. A plain deck of cards, a battered, wide-brimmed hat. And beside them, a cracked jar of sand. Sand from Fiji, last year - the last time I carried these items in battle.\n\nAnd failed.\n\nIn my heart, I can still hear the alien screeching of that enormous decapod, a monstrous sound unlike anything an earthly crab could produce, mingling with the battlecries and explosive onslaught of my Homeguard compatriots. And I can still remember the crushing despair of defeat, of loss.\n\nI reach for the hat, to toss it aside perhaps, but something catches my eye; a glitter of silver and gold? I hesitate, then with a suddenly trembling hand I reach out and gently move the jar of sand to one side, and stare at the badge shining beneath it, disbelief and wonder warring in my soul. The sigil of the Homeguard, and with it, a chance for redemption, and a chance to fail again. Could I even do it? Could I go back to the battlefield, with failure in my shadow, and fight once more?\n\nOne last turn of the cards, one last toss of the coin? \n\nHeh, I've never been one to pass up a gamble like that.\n\nI grab the badge, and flip the hat onto my head. The cards seem to fly into my hand of their own volition, the old skills returning in an instant, fanning out and snapping into easy shuffles, the familiar glows of red, blue and gold shining once more. I lift a finger, nudge the hat back slightly, and smile, for the first time in a year. \n\nIn the distance, I can hear the shrieking wail of this newest threat. Even where I am, mostly safe from the attack, the windows rattle softly in their frames. And there is something else, too. Almost an echo, a tiny sound of despair and loneliness... A note in a chord that doesn't quite match the rest. A cry for help, going unanswered.\n\nUnacceptable. The cards flare in my hand, empowered by will, and for the first time in a long time my mind is focused, my purpose clear. A snap of the wrist and the cards arc out, rapidly describing a blurring circle of colour, their magic - _my_ magic - bridging space and time, seeking the source of that helpless cry. Harnessed to this power, my eyes can see the creature for the first time, already locked in combat with Oceania's defenders - and I can see the tiny victim within.\n\nI spare a moment to appreciate the battle in progress. Three of my fellow Homeguards, stouter of heart than me, have been standing ready when they were needed the most. For them, this is destiny - the only thing they could ever have done. Surrender does not exist in brave souls like these, and neither does defeat. \n\nDestiny, huh? I pick a card, and fix my eyes on that tiny form within, knowing I have to save it, trusting the Homeguard to give me the opening I need. \n\nI am not disappointed. A prison of woven light snaps into existence around the creature, binding it in place. It fights the bonds, tearing at the luminous strands with impossible strength and breaking free, weathering the rapid barrage of power the light-manipulating Homeguard unleashes. Left open and momentarily drained, he nonetheless flips his staff into the air and conjures a barrier as the beast leaps at him. Golden sound, impossibly visible and undeniably beautiful, bathes the creature and it freezes in place, blinking through confusion as the irresistable sound steals control of its limbs. For a truly bizarre moment, it raises its head and lifts its front limbs, as though about to dance, unable to disobey the rhythm of the long-haired man standing behind it, a Homeguard whose fingers dance across strings that shimmer with synesthetic colour.\n\nThe last of the Homeguard seizes her chance and releases her arrow. It shimmers in the air, drawing the moisture around it to itself in an instant to increase its size and impact, and three feet of true ice explode against the beast. Frost instantly rimes the top half of the creature, trapping its limbs around its head and forcing it backwards.\n\nFor a perfect moment, the monster's center with its worthy treasure, is exposed.\n\nI won't have another chance. I leap forward, into the whirling circle of colour, hurling my card ahead in a blaze of golden light, other hand extended toward that tiny, lonely form...\n\n-----\n\nStory by Rick, hope you like it!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jason","date":"2017-01-25T03:04:44.618+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"**Immersion** \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnother Oceanic week event. Honestly, I was a little excited to hear about it, however in my mind I doubted it'd be as good as our Nautilus reef ocean week. Oh well, I decided to give it a read.\n\nThe theme and story of monsters attacking, and us needing to defend against them. It was the same as last year, but it still looked pretty fun, an excuse to party up and play with friends. Another decent event, it seems. I jump on the client, and ask some friends if they'd like to meet up at a net cafe, and have some fun with the event. Most agree, and we head into the city. Myself, Tim, Georgia, Viktor, and SussyPlayer. ( We're... not actually sure what his real name is, but we just call him Sussy )\n\nThere was discussions on the train about the Homeguards event, and how we're supposedly fighting monsters and such. However, the tone changed a little when a lady next to us mentioned that there was actually fears of a monster attack hitting the city.... I... wait, what? I mean, they know that monsters aren't real, right? This is a marketing event to promote social play, not to actually fight monsters. I mean, come on.\n\nThe train comes grinding to an urgent stop before reaching it's destination, the passengers all thrown forwards, some out of their seats. Once the train had come to a complete stop, the feel of a gentle vibration below us began to pick up, to a rumble and then to a shake, and that's when you could hear it.... the footsteps in the distance, something approached. Our group of friends managed to make it out of the train using the emergency door release, and that's when we saw it...\n\nLong, thin legs. large, round body. Small, thin head. And a lengthy, curved beak. The monster stood as high as an eight story building, dirty feathers of white, and a piercing stare emanating from it's small, beady black eyes. It was a giant Ibis. The first feelings of disbelief were eventually swelled as it let out an aggressive cry towards our train. This thing that defies all logic is here now, and it doesn't look happy. Georgia lets out a scream and begins running, as the rest of us do the same. Panic sets over everyone as they retreat. The giant ibis manages to clear several meters in a single step. Despite the futility of running, we keep going anyway.\n\nThe head of the giant Ibis gives a shadow over us as we realise it's close. I turn around to see it's long beak heading straight for us. I take what I believed would be my final breath, and close my eyes. I hear the sound of the beast letting out a scream in pain... Opening my eyes once more, I see her standing before us. A young woman in a familar dress holding a staff as a strange glow surrounds her like an orb. She lets go of her staff, which doesn't fall to the floor, rather begins to orbit around her. It's.... Wait, it's Lux? As she turns around to us I see her face, and.... wait, no, it's not lux. The dress and the staff resemble lux, but the woman wearing them is older, with darker hair. She instructs us all to stay behind her, and slowly make our way to safety. Her voice definitely isn't lux. The giant Ibis brings it's beak in for an attack, however the gently glowing orb around her begins to light up, and completely stops the attack from the giant, who is staggered backwards slightly.\n\nWhat is this, giant birds fighting cosplayer? there's so much confusion and panic as everyone runs towards the bridge for shelter. The Ibis extends it's wings slowly, before letting out a powerful gust of wind, knocking Lux off her feet, as well as a bunch of us further away. Seeing a vulnerability, the Ibis charges in with it's large beak, when suddenly a man appears to fall from the sky on the Ibis' beak, bringing it's head down to hit the ground. The man is muscular, bald, and is holding... a lid of some sort? He turns his head, revealing a glorious mustache sitting gently above his lips. It looks like another cosplayer, this time dressed as Braum. However, his shield.... it's not a door like from the game. Instead it's... the cover ripped off the top of a Barbecue. Not as effective as a giant unbreakable door in my opinion, but nonetheless, he did just save the other cosplayer.\n\n\"Hey guys, I need you to excuse me for a second...\" Tim remarks casually. He begins walking towards the Braum and Lux lookalikes. Reaching into his pocket, he pulls out a glove, and places on his right hand. \"Tim, what he hell are you doing, get back here!\" I shout at him, however he doesn't respond. Lux begins twirling her staff, as beams and orbs of light begin to originate and travel towards the giant Ibis. Meanwhile, the Braum is doing his best to fend off this giant bird with only his strength, and the cover of a barbecue. The balls of light reach the Ibis before imploding, causing the Ibis to let out a screech of pain. They're definitely damaging the beast. Tim jumps into the air before vanishing, and in a flash of light, he reappears by the Lux's side, and they nod to each other. \n\nThe Lux throws out both of her hands in front of her, as her staff hangs in the air right in front of her, and spins gently. Tim throws out his right gloved hand and clenches a fist, bringing his left hand in, miming as if he's pulling back the string of a bow. In front of them,  a flurry of lights and particles form, gathering and forming shape. Tim is.... Ezreal? It looks like they're both using ultimate abilities in tandem, focusing their attacks on the giant Ibis, whom is still attempting to clamp it's beak down on a muscular man and his barbecue lid. With a scream and shout of power from Lux and Tim... I mean, Ezreal I guess... their powers release directly at the Ibis. The Braum ducks and rolls out of the way, as the bright lazer of light pierces the Ibis who lets out a shout of agonizing pain, raising it's head high into the air. It's then when the Trueshot barrage comes in, right for the exposed neck, instantly separating the head from the rest of the Ibis' giant body.\n\nThe head flies through the air, as the body goes limp and falls to the floor, before the creature seemingly evaporates into light. With a flash, and a bellowing rumble, the creatue was gone. A moment of silence passed before the train commuters let out a collective celebratory cheer. Before us, stood three heroes. Well, two heroes and Tim. The question was asked, \"Who are you guys?\". A proud smile stretched across all three of their faces, and collectively they claimed, \"We're the Homeguards.\" The rest of the questions and accusations they don't really address that much, and all I can think about is wow, Tim has some questions to answer.\n\nThe three manage to jump onto the train before then making it onto the bridge above, and disappearing from view. The crowd has the collective sound of being quite confused by the whole matter as police show up, and slowly get everyone back on the train. Within a minute of the heroes fleeing the scene, Tim appears again, and just casually slides into the crowd, joining us. As we're about to praise him, he brings a single finger to his mouth, \"Shhhh.....\". We manage to contain our excitement, and noone else seems to notice us. I know that Riot wants to make their local events a lot more memorable, but man, the Immersion of this event is above all.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nStory by Jason.

Good job, keep doing that and you'll get your black belt in no time. Anyway, class dismissed,\" my teacher said before letting me go. On my way home, something didn't feel right. The clouds have been dark for a week now and there had been no sign of rain.\n\nI strangely noticed something by the beach. It was a turtle stuck on it's back. I ran over to help it suddenly an entity jumped over it and consumed it. The turtle cried in pain as it was mutating into something unimaginable. I stared at it, beating myself up for not getting there in time. The mutation was complete. It was horrifying. Fear ran throughout my body and I couldn't force my legs to run. \n\nMy mind was telling me to help the poor animal, but I didn't know how. Power was rushing up my arm, so I just threw it forward. A surge of power flew out of my hand and hit the creature in the forehead. It wailed in pain and locked its gaze onto me. I knew what I had to do, so I reluctantly ran up and kicked its chest. \n\nIt fell back a few meters and landed on the floor creating a breeze that blew sand into my eyes. I screamed as I lost vision of everything. All that I could rely on was my other senses. I suddenly felt a sharp blow in my stomach, throwing me fifty meters backwards. \n\nI started to panic. I tried to calm myself down with a few deep breaths. \"Remember your training,\" I told myself. \"Use everything else.\" I ran forward, determined to finish this battle. I slid under the creature's body and grabbed its tail. I flipped myself onto its shell and ran towards the neck.\n\nI did a round-house kick, causing the creature flip back on its shell. It was stuck. With my sight returning to me, I saw the opportunity to finish this. With my remaining strength, I leapt to the centre of the body, raised my fist and brought it down. Light suddenly exploded from the creature, pushing me back. There was smoke everywhere. \n\nOnce the smoke had cleared, I saw the turtle. It was severely injured. I ran over and carefully laid it in my bag. I rushed to the vets to get it treated. \n\nFrom that point on, I swore to defend our home from any danger that threatens us. From that point on, I would be...  **A Homeguard**.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWritten by Chris.

Wait a second did that say \"drift\" or am I hearing things. Anyway with my cool new Avitar that looks just like me with a giant keg of beer and long platted beard I set out into the jungle.\n\nAs I chill out in the jungle brush near the raptor camp, and drop my first keg I hear \"Minions have spawned\", and instead of seeing the raptors, out of the trees comes this crazy looking killer koala jumping onto my face, clawing scratching, I react taking this savage creature out of the brush then grab the little sucker throw it back as I swing with my magical beard catching him on the way out and hitting him with a sleep spell.\n\nAs the koala slept, the whole of summoners drift faded slowly, drifting into a dry red desert land,  as I moved on I saw the scuttle crab was now a wombat slowly making it's way across the dry cracked river, I decided to leave it for now and head back down for the red buff.\n\n","replies":[]}]}
