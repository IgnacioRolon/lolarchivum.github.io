But look at the word itself &#039;exclusive&#039; actually comes from the word exclusion which means to &#039;remove people&#039; which is the very essence of &#039;bullying&#039;, now i don&#039;t know about you, but i think theres enough negativity in the game already without the need for people to exclude others to make themselves feel special. We can all enjoy the skin, its a nice skin (one of the few actually decent ones riven has) and other people playing the skin doesn&#039;t make it any less good-looking, so when you&#039;re arguing &#039;i don&#039;t think it should be available&#039; have a think about WHY you think that, if you don&#039;t want it to be available because you want to feel special by owning something no one else can get, then you are excluding people, and no one likes to be excluded, so what you are in fact doing is making someone else feel bad so that you can feel good, (which is exactly what bullying is) so have a think about that._\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n**If your enjoyment of the skin comes from the fact that other people are sad because cant have it, that is bullying and i think you don&#039;t really deserve to have it.**","replies":[{"poster":"Grymmstrike","date":"2016-06-24T18:24:48.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I fail to see how having something someone else doesn't is bullying.
