So that&#039;s obviously why I didn&#039;t buy it on the day.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo... is it legacy or not?\r\n\r\nIf yes: why wasn&#039;t it mentioned on release? _(seems totally unfair to Ori players, or skin collectors)_\r\nIf no: why does it have a little legacy icon?\r\n\r\nCould someone clarify?","replies":[{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2017-05-22T04:23:38.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure that Riot announced that all 'Valentine Skins' will only be available during Valentine's Day when Heartseeker Lucian and Quinn came out.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-22T05:41:14.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really?
