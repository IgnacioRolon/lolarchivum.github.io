Yas is a reasonably old champion _(must be over 4 years now)_. But he is incredibly popular, and so people do wind up facing the same skin again and again and again, and it gets really boring. especially when he only has one really good skin.\n\nSo while I do believe that other champions should have more skins, before Yasuo gets some. I wont dispute that a legendary skin for Yasuo will benefit everyone _(after the initial plague of 'Yas mains' has ended of course)_.\n\nIt will make a champion who features almost literally twice in every game, a little more bearable and fresh.","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2017-06-02T01:46:33.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, have to agree with you on that.\nBut like some other people.\nI'm waiting for Heartseeker Urgot.\n{{champion:6}} \nPlease Riot.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2017-06-01T07:25:40.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not just the legendaries either (though how you forgot Elementalist Lux from that list I'll never know).\n\nMoo Cow Alistar was bloody brilliant.
