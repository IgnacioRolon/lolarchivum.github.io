So when you get smashed by an Azir, you know he&#039;s had to try pretty hard to do that, and that seems to soften the blow.\n\nBut someone like Yi on the other hand, who requires 0 effort to play, but an insane amount of concentration to VS, is much more antagonising to play against.\n\nWhen in mid, I groan every time I have to fight a Lux or a Brand, not because they&#039;re any stronger, or more powerful than my champs, because that&#039;s not necessarily true.  But because the effort I have to put in to avoid their crap, is so much greater than the effort they have to put in to hit me.\n\n\n_______________________________\n\n#**Sorry Lux, you&#039;re on the chopping block today.**\n\nIm going to pick on Lux for this post, not because I think she deserves it, but because I think she is the easiest champ to demonstrate what Im talking about.  Here we go:\n\nEven with the size and speed nerfs of Lux&#039;s E, it&#039;s still almost impossible to avoid one that is thrown by any half decent player.\nEven being behind minions isn&#039;t enough of a buffer to protect you from Lux either, you have to make sure to be behind at least 2 minions at all times, and because there&#039;s not that many spots where you can constantly be behind that many minions and still CS properly, you are pretty easy to either hit \nor zone with her E.\n\nAnd what makes it even more frustrating, is that if you are hit by just 1 of Lux&#039;s Q&#039;s, you either die or have to go back to base, because it requires no effort or setup to slam you with literally every other ability from wherever she happens to be standing at the time.\n\nSo you are punished really hard for putting in tons of effort and screwing up once.  And it costs her so little to be throwing out abilities relatively constantly, yet the payoff is so high when she does accidentally land one.\n\nVS someone like Zoe.  Yes, Zoe&#039;s abilities hurt a lot, but she if she just throws out her bubble willy-nilly and it happens to hit, theres so much she needs to prepare in such a small window of time.  She has to fire her Q in two different directions, ult to a correct position, auto attack, and all while doing this, have to navigate a safe path through minions for her Q to land, (on both casts).  So yea, Zoe&#039;s shit hurts, but she has to put in a ton of effort to achieve that.\nSo its really hard for her to throw out her combo starter willy-nilly, without prior prep.  Which means when she does prepare for it, and miss, it costs her.\n\nLux requires no prep, as you&#039;ve seen from playing her, if she thinks theres a chance to hit you, shell just chuck her stuff at ya. if it misses, oh well, try again in a few seconds.  If it hits, **E,R,AA,E,AA** **BAM!** dead within a second.\n\nBoth her ability and AA range is so long, that when she misses her abilities, she&#039;s not as as vulnerable as other champs may be, she can still sit at a relatively safe range and last hit until her abilities return,  and on top of that, she still always has a defensive ability up her sleeve if needed.\nWhere as other champions  (like Veigar for example) are a little more conscious of throwing out their CC, because they know how vulnerable they are without it.\n\nEither that or if they do hit it without prior setup, it&#039;s a lot less devastating for the enemy.\nLike Zyra for example, her E is relatively similar to Lux&#039;s Q.  But theres a big difference between Zyra using her E for some damage in lane, and her using E with the intent to go for the kill.\n\nWhen Zyra goes for the kill, she has to think about a lot at once, she has to make sure to put seeds very near _(but not on)_ her victim, then has to activate the seeds depending on the ability she wants _(usually Q for ranged plants)_ so she has to hit you with her snare, but also hit you with her Q AND make sure that the Q strikes first, so as to activate the plants before the E reaches them. _(meaning she has to hit her Q on both you and the plants, while you AREN&#039;T already snared.)_ Only after all that, can she ult.  For maximum effect.\n\nShe can&#039;t do all that, if she throws out a random E and it happens to hit. **Lux can.**\nThere is no distinction for Lux, between poking, and going for the kill. If she goes for the kill and misses, it only costs her the CD and mana of 1 ability.  It costs Zyra 2 abilities and 2 seeds very quickly, before she knows wether her attempt is successful or not. Zyra doesn&#039;t have the luxury of throwing her spells out and seeing if they hit, before using the rest.  \n\n_**To put this in perspective:\nIf Taliyah is going for the WE combo; she cant cast W, wait to see if it hits, then use E if it does.  She has to use them both almost simultaneously.  and if her prediction is wrong, it costs her 220 mana, and both of her defensive spells. Which is rather punishing.\nIf Lux wants to use her full Q,E,R,AA,E,AA combo, but misses the first spell, she can abort easily, and it only costs her 60 mana.  And she has a shield and a savage AoE slow to fall back on, should she get into trouble. So she is barely punished at all.**_\n\nSo while Lux is far from being super OP or toxic for balance.  She perfectly illustrates an example of a champ who requires little effort to play, and maximum effort to fight. And I think it&#039;s these kinds of champs that are the frustrating ones and cause people to have less fun in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Jonius7","date":"2019-01-15T05:20:21.262+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's possible that you may have to expend more effort dodging Lux's Q, because that's all she's got for lockdown: her getting an E off by itself isn't that impactful. You punish her when her Q goes on CD, so that by the time she's ready for the next rotation, well, she's already taken some damage.\n\nAs an ADC main, I have gotten cucked by some Lux supports, but once I just put the focus on dodging her Q in the back of my mind, well it's not that much extra particular effort for anything.

Lux also doesn't have good waveclear and next to no waveclear when forced to use her e as poke, and she cannot hardshove and instantly eat a wave like alot of other mages. Meaning often the way to win mid for some matchups, is just to perma shove mid and roam.\n\nShe can't just willy nilly use her ult for bonus damage due to the long immobilizing and very obvious charge up, she needs to have landed her snare to make use of it, and lategame most of her damage gets loaded into her passive procs, which forces her to position closer than most mages in a lategame scenario to pump out acceptable damage.\n\nLux is very much a basic champion with a very all around generalistic kit, she isn't an especially strong teamfighting playmaker, she doesn't have mobility, she doesn't have great range, whilst she has a strong combo, it requires her to use all her spells and does not hit many targets. She offers little in support besides a snare, a slow and a tiny shield, so she's mostly there for her high damage.\n\nLux is probably slightly over tuned, as a beginner style champion, as is quite common in league, but she isn't really OP and even though it's often not really mechanics, she has alot of things to consider when being played properly.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-01-14T14:04:46.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, she has lots of other tradeoffs like you mentioned when it comes to winning the game in general.\nBut most of these tradeoffs aren't felt when you're actually fighting her.\nIm not saying she is OP, or at all unhealthy in terms of winning/losing a game.\n\nI'm not saying she's impossible to fight, far from it, i'm just saying, it doesn't take much effort for her to throw shit at you, but it takes a lot of effort to dodge that stuff, and it is really punishing when you don't manage to dodge it. That kind of gameplay isn't fun.\nId say that Kog'maw is far unhealthier for the game than Lux, but the effort input needed to play Kog'Maw is relatively the same as the effort input needed to fight Kog'maw, so he doesn't feel frustrating and groan-worthy to fight.\n\nUnless you're someone like Zed who can magically hop over all her stuff while simultaneously taking her out, Lux is draining to fight.\n\nAlso she's hardly mid-range, Viktor is mid range, Malzahar is mid range, Karthus is mid range, Azir is mid verging on long range, and Lux outclasses even his range.  Lux is in the weight with Xerath and Vel'Koz.\nShe doesn't have a single ability under 1000 range, and all of them are muti-target/AoE.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-01-15T04:56:25.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no you don't get it, every champion has weaknesses, and sometimes it's not obvious in their kits. Lux suffers from short range in the lategame, and her poke isn't nearly enough to put her in the poke mage category since she has 1 spell for poke, which also serves as her primary source of waveclear (which is a very distinct weakness Lux has), and isn't nearly as easy to land as you make it out to be. Nor does it combo into the potential for alot of damage like true poke mages, since at maximum range it's hard for lux to follow up on the poke landing.\n\nHer ranges seem high, but her projectiles aren't especially fast, and she needs to position aside from the minion wave to land her abilities, since it is very hard for Lux to weave a q through a minion wave. Lux needs to be very aware of her own positioning and her opponents positioning to land her poke (unless her opponent is a moron who stands immediately within the caster minions and forgets that into mage matchups this is the worst place to position).\n\n1 long range spell does not qualify a poke mage. Sion is not a poke mage, Morgana is not a poke mage. \n\nZilean bombs have the same range as Lux e, alot more damage, and he has 2 of them, but he's not a poke mage (although his poke is absolutely more oppressive, he's still a midrange utility mage).","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-01-15T12:00:56.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I seem to have hit a nerve here regarding Lux. Sorry about that.\n\nBut I disagree with some of what you say, she can definitely poke/harass effectively.\n> 1 long range spell does not qualify a poke mage\n\nI mean, she doesn't have a single ability under 1000 range, that's hardly \"1 long range spell\".\nSecondly, you're ignoring her free Lich bane passive, which gives her a hell of a lot of harass and followup on her poke _(not to mention the actual lich bane that she also buys)_. And her AA range is second only to Annie and Anivia in mid lane. _(neither of whom actually use autos to fight or harass)_.\n\n> and isn't nearly as easy to land as you make it out to be\n\nI have never had issues landing it, and I'm on a permanent 220+ ping in Japan, so if I don't have a problem using it, its definitely not hard.\n\nTry landing all your stars in a fight without missing any, as Sol against champs with today's level of movement speed and mobility, then tell me how hard Lux's shit is.\n\nLux's E is exactly the same speed as Zoe's Q. Yet Lux's is a very decent sized AoE, and goes through minions.\nZoe's also has 80% damage reduction on enemies beyond the first _(in the tiny area that it hits)_. I don't see the same penalty on Lux's?\nSo if Lux's is so easy to avoid, why do so many people seem to have such issues with Zoe?\n\nBut it doesnt even matter if her abilities hit or not, it's not relevant to what im saying. Unless she's a complete cabbage and is throwing them behind her or into the river, you still have to dodge it. Which is draining, and takes up lots of time.\n\n> Lux needs to be very aware of her own positioning and her opponents positioning to land her poke\n\nYou've just described 90% of mages. How is this somehow _special_ counterplay for Lux?\n_\"Being out of position is bad for your health. and It's easier for you to hit people when they are out of position.\"_ That sounds like pretty standard gameplay for all champions.\n\nLux doesn't have an escape, many mages don't.\nBut her ult is the only ability she has that doesn't have a defensive capability. Most immobile mages can DEFINITELY not say the same.\nSo its not like she's constantly at the mercy of the world around her.\n\nYea if she blows all her spells and misses, she's probably gunna die, and deserves to, just like any other mage does.\nHowever because of the order of her kit, she never **_needs_** to throw out all her spells, unless she **_knows_** they won't miss.  If she misses Q, she's still got a hefty shield and slow to get her out of scrapes, and obviously if she misses Q, she's not just going to willy-nilly chuck out E. \n\nBut if she does hit Q, she just dumps everything on the victim for a kill. _(I.e. punishing to VS, less punishing to play.)_\nIf she misses E, it's not like she's forced to use her other abilities, she's still got a multi-target 2 second snare, and a shield as a crutch.\n\nSo she can always throw out relatively aggressive spells, without compromising her whole defence.\n\nYea she has tradeoffs like bad wave clear, _(still better than Zoe though, who everyone keeps telling me is an awful champion)_.  But wave clear isn't really an issue in lane, which is where she is the most annoying to vs. Her last hitting is easy, especially if she uses her E to poke, because it gives her a lich bane on half the minions in the wave, as a side bonus after damaging and getting a lich bane on you. \n\nBut ill say again, I still don't think Lux is a problem champ, she's just more frustrating than some.\nYea I play Azir, and yea id rather not vs Lux when I do. But it doesnt mean Im completely ignorant about her (hell, I play her often enough).\nBut it gets real old real fast, when you're playing someone who requires as much concentration as he does, and are VSing someone who literally is just chucking AoE/multi-target crap at you 24/7 _(from a relatively safe distance)_ just to upgrade forms faster.\n\nI still beat Lux as Azir on a relatively regular basis.  But do I enjoy trying?  No.\n\n_________________________\n\n\nBut despite all this, this post isn't even about Lux, she was just the example. Change it to whoever you want, if you must.\nThe point was that some champions require less skill to play than they do to vs, and this is the element that causes frustration, not actually how strong or weak a champion is.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-01-16T10:57:44.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh I don't even like Lux, can't really play her well but I can play against her fairly easily.\n\nAs much as I've been pointing out her weaknesses, she's one of my least favourite examples of kit recovery since her base damages are too high and whilst her cc sucks, if paired with any other cc, it becomes oppressive, and lategame Lux is always useful regardless of the competence of the player.\n\nEven then, there are plenty of mages who are less interactive to face, Zilean, Orianna, Syndra, Veigar, Ziggs, ect...\n\nAlso with higher skillcap champions, you trade off ease to play, with flexibility, the ability to outplay, make big turn arounds through sheer mechanics and generally slightly higher innate 'kit power', as a trade off for this difficulty.\n\nAlso to your 1k range arguement, firstly, her w isn't poke, so the range doesn't matter. Ults generally don't matter in early laning, and because of it's charge time, is only a finisher to be paired with her q or other hard lockdown cc, so again not poke. Her q moves slowly, and so is about as valid as poke as a Morgana q (which btw has a similar range, and isn't poke). Her auto attack range is 550, which is pretty good but not that unheard of for a mage, most mages have 550 auto range, and if you're walking up to let lux get her passive procs on you, you deserve to lose lane. It's an annoying zoning tool, but again that's why most midlaners either have ranged spells or mobility and alot of burst.\n\nI hate people complaining about easy vs hard to play champions. You decide what champions you play. Some people like easy to play champions so they can focus on playing around their opponent's champions, other people like to put it all on the line and believe they are mechanically superior.

So Lux tends to throw it out a lot more than other mages would with their CC.  So regardless of wether its poke or not, it's still something you have to be dodging relatively often.\n\nAhri isn't a poke mage, she technically qualifies as an assassin, but that Q is still flying back and forth like no ones business.  Yea its not a Zigg's or Xerath poke, but it's still annoying as hell to have to keep dodging.\n\nThe 1k argument definitely holds.\nLux's Q has a longer range than Vel'koz's Q, and her E has a smaller range by 50, but because the range is until the centre of the AoE, not the tip, her E ends up having the longer range by 105.\n\nLux is classed as an 'Artillery champion' under Riot's released sub-class regime\nWhich's direct description is:\n\n> Artillery Mages are the masters of range, and they leverage that advantage to whittle down their opponents over time from great distances.\n\nthe artillery champions are: {{champion:126}} (hybrid skirmisher) {{champion:99}} (hybrid burst) {{champion:110}} (hybrid marksman) {{champion:161}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:142}} \n\nEven Azir, and Syndra don't make that list.\nSo she is a poke mage, I don't really think thats up for debate. \nWe can disagree with it if we want, _(and I gotta say, labelling all the champs like that seems a little fruitless, considering the vast variety of niches)_ but thats what Riot has classified her as.\n\n> I hate people complaining about easy vs hard to play champions.\nIm not complaining about easy vs hard.\nI'm pointing out that champions who put little effort in _(doesn't necessarily mean they are easy champs)_, and require a lot of effort to VS, leads to frustration.\n\nGaren is a relatively easy champ who requires little effort.\nAzir is a relatively difficult champ who requires a lot of effort.\nZoe is a relatively easy champ to play, but she has to put a lot of effort in to land her abilities.\nKatarina is a relatively difficult champion to play, who doesn't put much effort in to land her abilities.\n\n**Input > output**, doesn't necessarily mean \"Hard to play\", and \n**Input < output**, doesn't necessarily \"Easy to play\".\n\n\n> You decide what champions you play.

Despite Yi being the training wheels champ, he just jarrs with my style of playing.  I click with Sol, I don't click with Yi.  So despite his drawbacks, I genuinely find Sol easier to play, (hella frustrating at times) but still easier.\n\nThat doesn't mean I'm better than Yi players.  My champion is simply different to theirs, and my brain is simply wired differently to theirs.  In a fight between Sol and Yi, Yi will almost certainly win, but that doesn't make Yi players better than me either.\n\nEventually players try out all champions, and we stick with the ones that click.

On the yearly review he is very likely the most common 'most killed and most killed by' champion for most people.\n\nAlso Lux's q isn't as long range as it seems because it moves slowly. Again, it's not reliable poke because it moves slowly and needs to be positioned to avoid the minion wave. Also in practice, she's not really a poke mage, because any other reasonably ranged mage is going to abuse her so hard. Zilean isn't classified as a poke mage, but Lux will get poked way harder in this matchup.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-01-17T08:51:40.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, that was kinda a joke.\n\nYea, thats the same reason why I don't like Yasuo.\nI like Variety, and Yasuo/Lee etc remove variety from the game.\nYou'll notice that I don't complain about champs like Urgot much, even though they are overturned, I really don't care because I see one maybe once a week, so the way I see it, they don't really affect the game as a whole much.  However, I deal with Yasuo on a face to face basis multiple times a day, every day.  So every little thing he does that steps even a nanometer out of line, pisses me the fuck off, because I have to deal with that in my face every single day.\n\nIts like that saying how you start to hate even your best friend if you cant get away from them _(people on treks in Antarctica or shipwrecks etc)_. Yasuo was once my main, now I despise him.\n\nLux's Q moves at the same speed as Zoe's Q, _(is Zoe's Q not poke?)_\nAlso she only has to position around half of the minion wave, as her Q goes through the first thing it hits. _(Zoe's Q doesn't go through anything.)_\n\nHer Q is faster than Twisted Fate's Q, i don't think there's many people who wouldn't classify that ability as good poke.\nBut like I said, she doesn't even need to hit, it just needs to keep you dodging and scared, waste your time, and keep you away from CSing easily.  Sometimes knowing it **_can_** hit, and knowing she can use it anytime, is more scary than it actually being thrown at you.  Look at Karthus, he doesn't need to hit you with his Q, he just needs to keep you running in circles unable to stand still long enough to do anything.\n\n> any other reasonably ranged mage is going to abuse her so hard\n\nShe outranges almost every mage in the game.\nSo unless she's a cabbage, she's got a pretty good chance of not being bullied too hard.\n\nBoth of her abilities are longer than everything Syndra has. Certainly longer than Azir's _(and unlike the Shuriman shuffler, she doesn't have to stand still for most of the time when using it)_, her range is comfortably longer than Karthus' Q. She outranges Brand/Taliyah/Neeko/Karma/Veigar/Viktor/Cassiopia/Orianna etc.\n\nSo i'm not exactly sure who these 'reasonably ranged' mages are?\n\nIncluding the hitbox, Zilean's Q range is still shorter than both of Lux's spells.\nSo i'm not quite sure how she's getting out-poked by him either?\nAdmittedly if I have ever had a Lux/Zilean matchup in mid lane, it was so long ago I cant remember it, but it doesn't sound like a common problem.\n\nZIlean is a pain, always has been, probably always will be. But he suffers the opposite affliction to Yasuo. Turns out being a wind samurai is just a bit cooler than being a crusty old man with 5 voice over lines _(bad voice over lines at that)_.\n\nTo map it out, both Lux and Zilean have 550 AA range.\nLux's Q has a range of 1100 (including the hitbox, her E is longer still), which means if they are both attacking the melee minions from max range, she can still potentially hit him with both spells, but he cant hit her with anything without moving forward. It doesn't matter how slow or fast either of them are, it is **impossible** for his spells to hit from that range, but not impossible for hers. So as long as she maintains the range (which is where the skill comes in), he can never touch her, but she can touch him, even if she has to throw out 100 spells to do it.\n\nBut even if Zilean does out-poke Lux somehow, thats not really a big thing.\nA champ tons of people play, gets poked by a champ no one plays, (and even fewer people play well). Hardly an issue for her.\n\nMaybe it'll affect mid lane Lux in 1 out of 300 games? Thats being generous, I cant even remember the last time I saw a Zilean in mid.   Support Lux maybe is affected slightly more, but then the dynamic is so different in bot lane, that you cant know who has the upper hand without knowing what ADC's they are paired with.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-01-17T16:01:50.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i mean, Zilean bombs, if you include their generous latch range have around the same range as lux's spells, gotta remember that it's 900 range+100latch range and 300 explosion radius, and upto approx 125 latch range if you juggle the latch with the targeting bug, and if you're using the triplecast dbl bomb combo on a minion and if you use the edge of the explosion to clip an enemy, Zilean's maximum effective range is between 1300-1325 range, over the top of a minion wave, with a very short cast time.\n\nThis sounds very complicated, but since Q is Zilean's only damage spell, Zilean mains get pretty good at this gimmick within a few hundred games of practice. For the most part, this becomes a braindead habit, which is rarely punishing since it also hard shoves the wave and can zone the enemy away from your backline cs. Admittedly it can expend a bit of mana if the Zilean start's carelessly using this combo all the time, but Zilean's tend to opt for items like Ludens/RoA/Seraphs naturally anyway.\n\nLux q has 1175 range and her e zone has an an absolute maximum 1310 range.\n\nSo I'm not sure what you mean by Zilean having to move up or being outranged? The range difference is basically nothing, and since Zilean can already have increased movespeed from e, and cast whilst moving if he cancels the wind down from his q cast with a move command, it's much harder for the Lux to anticipate and reposition, dodge and capitalize on this very brief window when both champions are mutually in range. \n\nAlso Zilean has dumb auto attack animation, since the windup for his projectile is very short and all his other spells can be used during the wind down, so it's often not safe to assume you can harass him when he's last hitting a melee creep. Since he may very well be eyeing one of your backline casters, to get his damage off on you, whilst eating the caster creeps and still not missing the melee last hit.\n\nAlso TF q is nice poke if it lands, but otherwise it's good waveclear, he can use it for both simultaneously, so the acceptable projectile speed and damage is lower. It's a good bonus side effect, if it didn't damage minions or was blocked by minions or only did a small AoE splash damage on impact, it'd be alot worse of an ability.\n\nZoe can be creative on how she wields her q, if she isn't trying to get a massive windup, it can be pretty difficult to dodge. The massive windup is really only when you have other cc on your target such as sleep or Nautilus. Not to mention the psuedo blink adds alot to the surprise factor of Zoe. I personally consider her more of an artillery assassin than a true poke mage.\n\nViktor laser range is 1125, but again, it can be used for both waveclear and poke, at the same time and has a faster travel time, since whilst 1350 speed sounds slower, it's 1350 travelling down 500 units, rather than 1200 travelling down 1175, and once upgraded the repeat damage is a good zoning tool.\n\nAnd I guess I'll correct myself, Lux is pretty long range, but she's sort of a member of the 'annoying range' club than a true poke mage, especially since her spell travel times, mean that opponents will often move back, and make her range sometimes feel shorter (against a 600+ movespeed Zilean, you will definitely feel your spell's travel times being sluggish).","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-01-18T08:39:48.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will admit It sounds like I have a lot less experience with Zilean than you.\nI see him only now and then, and usually all I see is him ulting himself and leaving the ADC to the wolves.\n\nAdmittedly I didn't take the double bomb clipping into account, I only used the base range and the initial latch. So with that additional range, he may well be a competitor for Lux! _(we have now gone out of my experience with Zilean so I'm having to take your word for it)_.\n\nAssuming you're good with that gimmick I can see how he might be a pain for her.\n\nEither way, it sounds like he still has to put in a lot more effort to hit her than she does to hit him though.\nespecially if he has to use 3 spells just to land any damage at all, and even then can only match her range through a gimmick that needs a lot of practice for.\n\nSo regardless of who **_can_** get the better poke, it still seems like in terms of effort, Lux is still \"Input < Outcome\" while Zilean is \"Input = Outcome\". But I haven't played or Vsed a Zilean in mid for a long time, and certainly not with/against Lux in recent memory, so i'm not going to stake my life on that.\n\nTwisted Fate's Q is good wave clear, but in my opinion some of the best pokers/harassers can poke without passively pushing too hard. Twisted Fate pushes waves hard just by **_trying_** to poke, so does Xerath, Velkoz etc. Which inevitably opens themselves up to ganks. _(which as immobile squishies is often the last thing you want to do.)_\n\nPeople like Annie and Vladimir, may not have the best poke, in terms of poke itself.  But because they have these completely reusable low CD single target abilities, they can harass the enemy down without touching any minions at all, and thus keep the lane frozen wherever they need while forcing the enemy away from the minions.\n\nWhere as Xerath/Vel/TF etc, always end up under the enemy tower before long, if they're trying to poke.\n\nSo while Annie and Vlad etc aren't long range artillery mages, their ability to poke without pushing make them just as scary. So poking abilities with great wave clear aren't necessarily always good.\n\nDont get me started on Viktor's laser, I hate vsing that thing. It's so hard to predict, and it IS fast, like you say.\n\n> against a 600+ movespeed Zilean, you will definitely feel your spell's travel times being sluggish\n\nNo arguing with that.\nMost spells feel sluggish already, the MS creep in this game has gotten worse and worse. Trying to hit people with abilities like Taliyah's W or Karthus' Q isn't getting any easier..\nMovement speed has become a powerhouse of a stat in the past year or so.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-01-14T13:05:10.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's also important to consider Lux in context and comparison to other champions in her role, to her own ilk, as a midlane Mage or mage support.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-01-14T10:00:04.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should, honestly, rename this thread to, “I do not know how to verse Lux”\n\nShe is an obnoxious champion, I agree. You compared her to Zoe and you were right. Both of them throw out the same type of spell then blow their whole kit on it. Lux on her snare and Zoe on her sleep.

Not to mention the plethora of ADC's and fighters that people take mid nowadays.\n\nBut mid laners are for the most part a glass cannon style, that's how they play. Pick a target, and throw everything at them. Most glass canons in most games rely on lockdown and burst.\nIts like saying _\"Yea, well find me an ADC that doesn't use kiting.\" _ yea there are a couple, but essentially that's what the class is built around.  If that's your complaint, might as well complain about tanks who have survivability spells.\n\n> You compared her to Zoe and you were right. Both of them throw out the same type of spell then blow their whole kit on it. Lux on her snare and Zoe on her sleep.\n\nBut the way they do it is different,  regardless of what people think of her, Zoe does need setup, and there is both room for her to screw up her combo, as well as time for you to reposition or use defences. Once you get hit by Lux, that's it, no second chances, and its virtually impossible for her to fuck up. There are so many ways to reduce Zoe's impact, _(the least of which being: Use the one and half seconds to walk behind minions)_\nOnce Lux hits you with Q, the rest of her kit stops for nothing. Maybe the windwall will do it, but if you had a windwall you wouldn't have been hit by the Q in the first place. And her kit's CD is shorter than Zhonyas.\n\n> You compared Lux to Zyra but the two are almost the exact same.\n\nNo, that's the point, yes they can both achieve the same outcome, but Zyra can't achieve it after throwing out random E's, hoping they hit then dropping her combo on them, like Lux can with her Q, Zyra does need some degree of either setup or prediction.\nIn lane, Zyra's E snares for half the time Lux's Q snares for, and she has twice as many spells to drop on you in that time. Zyra can hit you with her snare, then slap you with other spells, you're right, very few mid laners cant do that, but unlike Lux, Zyra cant maximise her damage by hitting snare first.  If you want to maximise Zyra's damage, you have to place two seeds then land Q, THEN land snare, then ult. Otherwise the enemy spends less time immobile and thus less time getting hit by plants.\n\n> Who, in this game, actually takes effort to play?\n\nAurelion Sol, Azir, Kindred, Kalista, just off the top of my head.\nAnyone who requires constant awareness and/or a decent amount of setup.\n\n> Zed, Yasuo, Yi, Tryndamere, Riven, Galio, Rengar, and Kha’zix are all champion that fit into your title with more accuracy than Lux.\n\nI 100% agree, but like I said in my post, Lux is the easiest to demonstrate it with. She's simple, you can easily analyse her kit without getting too deep. Try to analyse Yasuo without getting lost down the deep rabbit warren that is his fucked up existence. And i'm not going to talk about Yasuo if I can help it, it just drags the same people out of the woodwork and always ends in violence.\n\nI have almost nothing against Lux herself. \nPretty much the only thing I don't like about her is how she (relatively) is Low risk high reward. I never said she was OP or was a problem for the game, like Nightjar said she has other tradeoffs that nullify her advantage over the game in general. Im just saying it takes effort to vs her, more so than it does to play her, and that style does not promote fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-01-15T04:47:57.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lux has exploitable weaknesses, understand them and she's easy to play against, and it becomes far more mentally draining for the lux player. \n\nFor instance, my old favourite meme Zilean. On paper Lux wins the 1v1, she seems to have a range advantage, but in reality, Zilean just bombs the wave constantly, shoves Lux in, and never really fights her to begin with. It's now upto the Lux to play risky, move up and try to catch the Zilean out in the very small window where he bombs the wave, and hopes that the jungler isn't going to murder her for overextending, or that zilean isn't going to dodge or she misses.\n\n In this matchup Lux has to play proactively, and if she makes a mistake she gets punished. Zilean on the other hand can mentally flatline.\n\nAnother good matchup is Annie, where it's very necessary for Lux to play around the range of Annie's flash-stun, protobelt-stun, and the importance of using her q bind premptively as soon as it looks like Annie is about to charge her stun and walk up, because it's travel time means, that if Annie moves up and Lux uses her q as a reaction to this aggressive movement, it is already too late, and Lux will get full combo'd before the bind allows her to disengage.\n\nAnother fun matchup is Karma, who similar to Zilean will just eat the wave, shove it in, and roam.\n\nYou've also got Yasou, who can windwall everything and weave through minions to close the gap. This matchup is alot more stressful for the Lux player than the Yasou player.\n\nYou've also got Ap Malphite mid, in high elo KR, this matchup devolves into pre-6, Malphite has to dodge everything, and post-6, if Malphite has ult, Lux has to leave.\n\nYou've also got Fizz, the more reliable version of Ap Malphite.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-01-15T04:48:25.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"basically I feel like you just don't know how to abuse Lux's weaknesses and you main Azir, possibly the worst matchup into Lux.\n\nAlso Kindred is not hard to play, coordinating with your team and not getting bullied by mean counterjungling menaces like shaco is hard.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
