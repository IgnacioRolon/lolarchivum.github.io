I never directly insult or put down anyone, i may be condescending and arrogant but I'm hardly ever toxic.  I do sometimes raise sensitive issues, and if people like yourself happen to find offence in said issues then they are welcome to argue their view, but its never personal, and i am within my right to raise them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-06-26T11:35:35.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is like the third one you've done today you don't seem to like a lot of the damage some champs do hey?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-26T11:50:22.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont mind the damage, i just don't like when it tells me the wrong things.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-06-26T13:22:22.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well the death overview has been broken for a while","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-06-26T06:14:11.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I knew this was a Lord post before I even read the creator lmao","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-26T06:25:44.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I'm the only one willing to take a stand on RIOT's issues of clarity, then so be it :P\n\nat least I'm making a name for myself. xD","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-06-26T12:05:15.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well you seem to always die to some bug like once a week.
