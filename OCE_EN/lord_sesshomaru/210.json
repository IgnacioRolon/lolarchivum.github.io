(Black Alistar being a previous example of this)\n\nAlso Ryze has more Legacy/limited skins than he does real skins, and unlike Shen/Karthus/Sion/Poppy etc (who have less) theres not even a Ryze bundle in the shop, hardly fair in my opinion. \n\nAnd regarding Young Ryze: you changed the splash art, you changed the in-game model, you even changed the name of the skin, it is LITERALLY a completely new skin, but theres still no way of ever getting it...\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-07-14T00:08:24.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I personally would like some of Ryze's skins that are in fact limited, I know that usually when they update skins its not really for profit as much as it is fan service and that even if the skin is now unobtainable, Riot did it out of courtesy to those who paid or earned their skin through some method so that they might continue to enjoy the exclusivity of the skin without feeling ripped off or disappointed.\nAnd while the changes to the skins may be vast, their thematic approach to what makes the skin identifiable remains relatively the same.
