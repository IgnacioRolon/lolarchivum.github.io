I feel either a reduced snare duration (maybe lowered arm time to compensate?) or a limit of 4 would be nice without gutting the ability.\n\nThat said, while reliable, Caitlyn is hardly a champ I'd call OP. The traps are really only too strong if you have a team comp to back it up :P","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-03-18T09:17:23.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it could be interesting to have the traps unable to arm themselves if they are within X units of an enemy champion.\n\nThat way she could use them for actually setting pre-meditated a trap, rather than just using them as a slightly delayed in-battle snare.\nIt would also mean she could still zone you, but only if she pre-planned it, and not just wall you off when you're right there.\n\nIm not sure, I'm not a caitlin player, so i don't know how much that would damage her.\nJust a thought.\n\nBut with a 20%+ pick rate, and one of the higher winrates, she's obviously doing something a lot better than other champs.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-03-18T10:54:47.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think such a thing would be a bit much, it removes a lot of the play making power Caitlyn has, and she already doesn't have that much given her kit and range.\n\nHer pick rate is likely so high because she's one of the most reliable ADCs. It's hard to get behind even with basica competency, and pretty hard to snowball against her since she's so safe, especially if she has a decent support.

She also has good synergy with pretty much any champion.\n\nAll the more reason to reduce some of her power.\n\nYoure probably right though, I agree that my suggestion probably was too much, but it cant be _too_ far from the mark.\n\nAs it stands, her support's entire job is to hold the enemy still for 1.1 seconds, as long as they can do that, she can just pop a trap under the enemy, stopping them from reaching her for another 2 seconds. When they finally get out of that, she just throws a net towards them, leaping to safety as well as slowing them, giving herself even more time to deliver the final headshot. Thats like a free 4 second window for her to kill them.\n\nAny ADC even half worth their salt can kill just about anything in 4 seconds. \nHell, im probably the shittest ADC out there, on top of that, Kalista is my main bot laner, and even I could kill something given that window.\n\nSomething needs to go on her, either its her range, her headshot damage, the death-sentence traps, or her easy escape.\nHaving some of that is fine and makes her who she is, but all of it is a little much.\n\nIn my opinion of course.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-03-18T15:27:12.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's be honest, the balance in this game is never going to be perfect. Overwatch only has a roster of 24 heroes and even that game will never find perfect balance. These kinda games are constantly evolving, and I think there are higher balance priorities than Caitlyn atm, especially when there are still plenty of assassins that can shut her down pretty hard :P\n\nMy point though, was that reliability (which can heavily influence pick rate) doesn't necessarily mean a champ is too strong. Remember that all of us are speaking from limited perspective, and I can't help but notice that most of us here in this thread are no higher than gold (at least not on the accounts they are posting with), so our perspective is limited.\n\n___\nAs for balance more generally:\nhttp://www.gdcvault.com/play/1024237/Balancing-League-of-Legends-for\n\nThis was a real interesting video to watch (real glad there was a x1.25 option though) from Ghostcrawler about game balance. Most of it is a general developer spiel in the sense that he is using League as his example to draw broader conclusions, but he talks specifically about why League balances the same at all levels of play (i.e where there aren't different patches for low elo, high elo and pro) among other things.\n\nHe also talks about some other contested topics like why Riot doesn't give visible data and why they tend to overpatch rather than underpatch to tune more finely (nerf fatigue and time constraints).\n\nHe also mentions a rather sad example in your beloved Azir, something he refers to as basementing where they basically nerf a champion out of the game until they can spend adequate time to properly fix their problems :(\n\nAll in all it's a good insight onto how Riot balances, and why they do what they do. A lot of people seem to think that balance changes are made out of spite, or at the very least a lack of insight, bu there's a lot more to it than that.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-03-18T22:28:24.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, of course it can never be perfect :P\nBut if the balance of the game needs to be a game of whack-a-mole, then lets at least whack the moles when they do pop up. xD\n\nAnd you're definitely right, there are champs that need far more attention than cait!\n\nThanks for the link to that video btw, i haven't watched it all yet, but its pretty insightful.\n\nYea haha feels bad for Azir xD. But tbh I like him underpowered, those who love him can still have a +50% winrate on him \nand it means he isn't the go to pick for every man and his dog when they want to win, like Zed and Hecarim.\n\nAnd in my opinion, nerfing them out of the game is much better than leaving them in there to cause problems. \nIts better to disadvantage Azir players and nerf him, rather than disadvantage all mid laners by leaving him as a monster.\n\nYea i know theres a huge amount of thought that goes into patches, and none of it is done out of spite.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-03-19T03:50:43.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's hard to deny their logic once you actually understand it ey.

And those 3 and a few others essentially hold riot hostage through their popularity.\n\nYea i watched a good deal of it, and i definitely will go back and watch more, its really insightful! xD","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-03-18T12:13:53.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean it just makes her already strong siege ability that much stronger.
