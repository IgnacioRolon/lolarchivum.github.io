That's like saying if I use my SG Udyr, Pulsefire Ezreal, PAX Sivir, PAX Jax or Silver Kayle skins you'll be intimidated and be unable to perform as well because I have a rare and awesome skin.\nIt's an icon, it doesn't mean anything other than you like the look of it.\n\nYou want everyone to use the same icon? Organise it with a five man premade before hand, you'll never get a random lobby to do exactly what you want.\nAnd in no way will five people using the same icon be intimidating, you want five people to be intimidating? You all change your names to include a clan tag.\n\n\nThe loading screen only lasts 5 seconds, what is the point in changing something specifically for a match that will only be seen for 5 seconds?
