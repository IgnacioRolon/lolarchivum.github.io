So an item that gives you **mana** and **CDR** with a dueling passive, is in no way &#039;essential&#039; on her.. RoA and Rylais maybe.. but not morellos.\r\n\r\nThere is no logic to these changes, and if there is, it is so far over my skill level that i cant even see it.\r\n\r\nAnd to make it worse, you cant even revert these changes by making your own custom item sets _(even if you make them in the old client, but play in the new one, it still doesn&#039;t work.)_\r\n\r\nHas anyone else experienced weird changes to their &#039;Recommended&#039; items?","replies":[{"poster":"nochillgamer","date":"2016-11-29T11:05:14.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me just go through some of my thoughts:\n\n1. Corrupting is a solid starting item on Sol, not only because of the compensation for the amount of mana he uses hard pushing the wave at Level 1, but also synergies with his W with early poke and trades.\n2. Unless you are mixed up between the two, I'm not sure where you got Hextech Protobelt-01 from. Since the mana cost nerfs on Sol, giving him a Hextech GLP-800 over RoA is pretty nifty, since you get the mana of a full stacked RoA\n3. When you say tanky, I think you mean sustainable.\n4. Morellonomicon is an essential starting item on most mages right now; with 100 AP and CDR, what better could you asked for (and you get the CDR for Taliyah's ult, 120 second cooldown at max rank)\n5. You can just press \"All Items\" and find, you guessed it, all of the items you need.\n\nMy point is, they change the recommended items occasionally to fit the style of where the game is currently at, so you will probably see lots of changes like this in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-11-29T21:34:38.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why would you hard push the lane at lvl 1?\nand why would it need mana?\nYour normal stars are more than enough to last hit minions, and if you're good you can do it without touching the other minions.\nYou only want to be pushing the lane at lvl 6+ so you can roam, do it before that and you open yourself up to needless ganks _(and sol doesnt like ganks)_\n\nAnd Dorans gives you more damage in trades than corrupting potion.\nYour normal Q/W/Thunderlords combo, takes between 1/3 and 1/2 of their HP in a single trade and all you need for that is 1 Q and 2 stars _(so it doesn't use much mana)_\nif you just sit there with W on all the time, then sure you'll use up mana, but who does that?\n\nand no, the pros definitely used Protobelt in worlds _(i watched very carefully)_.\n\nAnd morellos isn't that essential, maybe on people like Syndra and LB it is, but not on Azir/Sol/Taliyah, they have other items they need to rush in order to be effective.\n\nYea obviously all items has all the items in it (No fricken way!!!) but you still have to trawl through all the items to find what youre looking for.\n\nand no, i mean tanky.\nSustainable refers to champs like Soraka or Swain, who can sustain their lives without needing HP\nwhen you have this much HP:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/ke0le\n\nPretty sure you fit more into the tanky side of things.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-11-28T02:11:21.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"even though control wards are a less valuable version of the vision ward, I don't like how riot is like 'yeah we fucked up vision wards, so we won't bother including control wards in the recommended item pages anymore anyway since they're bad and players should just forget about the fact we removed the only item that could save you from a fed stealth assassin'.","replies":[{"poster":"nochillgamer","date":"2016-11-29T11:13:02.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nightjar,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=8mQyztql,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-11-28T02:11:21.903+0000)\n>\n> even though control wards are a less valuable version of the vision ward, I don&#x27;t like how riot is like &#x27;yeah we fucked up vision wards, so we won&#x27;t bother including control wards in the recommended item pages anymore anyway since they&#x27;re bad and players should just forget about the fact we removed the only item that could save you from a fed stealth assassin&#x27;.\n\num... they **are** in the recommended pages... and what are so 'bad' about them?
