Good. You get free wards, now go ward the crap out of everything and they're f*cked.\n\nWant to farm a lane? Bad luck, you have to team fights - almost all farm lanes have been abolished. If you lose fights, enjoy having your buffs stolen, dragon taken (now gives buffs) or baron taken. Enjoy the loss.\n\nGame is less about fights, more about pressing an advantage in many ways and co-ordination.\n\nI am against this because I feel like Riot is balancing around competitive play and leaving new-comers and people wanting a fun game - in the dust. It's becoming a war, not a game. With fun less of an orientation. While I enjoy beating people at a video game, it's becoming far less about skill and more so about co-operation. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it was better when it was a solo fest with a bit of grouping than it is now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Heimer","date":"2015-08-24T17:56:01.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its funny how they wanted to tone down snowballing but they've ended up making it worse","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2015-08-24T16:13:15.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"havnt had a good fun close game in weeks... kinda puttin me off continuing to play tbh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HTMekkatorque","date":"2015-08-24T15:38:28.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I realised this myself its probably due to the influx of champion changes. Like... I was like gold 3 or 2 when they nerfed alistar big last time. Now I only play him at like a gold 5 level and he's like my best chap. If you think how many major changes have been introduced to the game. Everyones sense of worth is getting thrown around with every tweak and yeah I think the only solution for riot to fix this is to slow down the changes a little. Like bringing 5 new champions into spotlight and basically deleting 5 like each of the last like 3 patches has done seems to be overkill. In the past it might have just been like an underplayed champion got a tiny bit of a buff or an op champ got a slight nerf but now its like we are going to give this champion a complete overhaul (gp, teemo... whatever the feel of the day is) then chuck in items that totally change the tempo of the game and yeah like I said bring a ton of champs into spotlight and made a few more obsolete for a while specifically ludens echo change then cinderhulk and then now the possible op thing running around is that on hit jungle item.","replies":[]}]}
