Just select the instrument from the drop down menu at the top. \n\nAs for the Tahm Kench theme, your best option is to go for guitar tab, and make some small adjustments from there for bass. You'll need to know a tiny bit of music theory, but it should be relatively easy. \n\nI actually did a Guitar Cover for the Tahm Kench with downloadable tabs in the description. Check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pItH8vPFluY), if you're interested.\n\nIf you're struggling with anything, feel free to get in contact with me. I can give you a hand if you need.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-01-11T10:36:02.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much man!\nI'm afraid music isn't my strong suit but I do want to get back into playing the bass again and what better to play than league stuff xD\nThanks I will :)","replies":[]}]}]}
