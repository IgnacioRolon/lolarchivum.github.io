(Hear me out)","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"We have all experienced that moment in ranked where one person decides to go heimerdinger jungle without smite, or is last pick and refuses to communicate, except when its their turn to pick and they say &quot;but i dont have any supp champs, ill just go zed supp&quot; and the whole team in that moment knows that the game is lost, in the last lobby i was in, our last pick decided to go supp fiora with no exhaust, and two other members of the team said that they were in the last game with that player and that that player trolled all game, so one brave soul said &quot;I&#039;m probably going to dodge&quot; and the whole team (me included) felt relieved. \r\ni know that dodging is bad and i personally don&#039;t do it myself, but in this case that one guy saved us all from losing 20LP at cost to himself, \r\nso why doth we try and implement an &#039;opt out&#039; vote so that if you get someone who refuses to communicate or trolls or &quot;doesnt have supp champs&quot; if everyone else in the team votes to opt out, it disbands the lobby.\r\n\r\nthe only problem with this is that people would opt out when the enemy team comp is better, i dont know how this could be avoided but there must be a way, maybe if the enemy team could somehow be included in the vote as well (they will probably just not vote because they want to win, but there are some people who do actually do want fair games, so its at least a hope)","replies":[{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2015-06-25T01:47:17.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes coz 20 minute queues would be amazing","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-06-25T01:59:09.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what does that have to do with it?","replies":[{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2015-06-25T02:04:28.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=42O3OpLz,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-06-25T01:59:09.519+0000)\n>\n> what does that have to do with it?\n\nqueue times are already painful as they are, imagine inputting an opt out method, \"ohh this guy picked an unconventional laner, i'll just leave\", it's bad enough as it is","replies":[{"poster":"Colour Shade","date":"2015-06-25T04:55:30.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or this dude just took my lane opt out","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-06-25T08:03:18.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you can get 8 other people to vote to opt out because you had your lane taken then i salute you","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-06-25T15:28:08.565+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why the hell would the enemy team ever opt out if someone picked troll stuff and they're heavily favoured to win","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-06-26T01:10:40.585+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"because believe it or not some people actually like a fair game","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Queen Dingus","date":"2015-06-25T05:58:48.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its a team majority vote that he is asking for, He isn't saying get rid of time penalty but have an option there for when you have a \"troll\", perhaps they could instead have an opt-out for the whole team, but something like a kick that gives a reduced penalty to the person \"trolling\" that way it would perhaps stop players from wanting to be \"trolls\".
