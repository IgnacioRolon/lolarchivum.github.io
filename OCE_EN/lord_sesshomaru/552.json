With the movement of so much damage into item passives and actives, even AD heavy champions can and up with a large amount of magic damage.  Players need to know where the damage they take comes from, and what kind of damage it is.  Many people underestimate this knowledge, sometimes its the difference between choosing what targets to take out (or avoid) in fights as well.\r\n\r\nThe current death recap also slacks off on registering CC.  A large amount of the time, it's not the damage itself that signed your death warrant, but being hit with some form of CC.  Sometimes that CC is hard to see during a fight, and unless the CC itself was one of the top 3 damaging abilities (or bottom 3, depending on the death recap's mood that day), it wouldn't register, which only leads to frustration.\r\n\r\nToo many times I sit back in my chair and think \"Why did I die there?\",  \"Why was I slowed\", \"What hit me??\", \"But I was out?!\"  These are questions that should never have to be asked, and now hopefully they won't need to be.\r\n\r\nSo here's to the new death recap! \r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \r\n\r\nAlso, NEW001 you say _\"may the death recap rest in peace\"_ but I'm afraid I can't concur, selfishly I want that sh*t to BURN for all the hell it caused us. ^_^","replies":[]}
