Here's a quote that I believe touches upon the concerns you may have:\n\n> One question we saw players ask was, “Does the Bench cause teams to be ‘better’ on average, with more high-winrate champions per team?” The short answer is no. While the ability to select a teammate’s rerolled champion does increase team quality a little, this effect was compensated for by the expanded F2P rotation, causing overall champion diversity to remain steady.\n\nhttps://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/06/dev-aram-changes-roundup/","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-11-05T13:29:26.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, that's great and all, but it doesn't explain why all champs aren't unlocked?\nIts like them saying _\"Planes are dangerous, but instead of improving the plane, we will give you better life rafts!\"_\n\nSure the rotation is bigger, but if I only own Vel'Koz and Xerath, the chances of me getting them is still higher than someone who owns all 200+ champs. _(especially when the strong champs are in the rotation)_.\n\nAll **Random** All Mid\nit's hardly random if you can sway your chances more than someone else, even just slightly.\n\nWhy not just make the F2P rotation just a little bigger again, and include _all_ champs?\nUnless they are willing to admit what they are afraid of by doing so, I don't see any reason not to have all champs unlocked.","replies":[]}]}]}
