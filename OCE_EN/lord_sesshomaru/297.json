You'll notice that there's actually a lot of downtime between auto-attacks. Usually you wont have to last hit any more than 2 minions in succession before they die, and when you do need to kill more than 2 minions in a short period of time, it's more efficient to use an ability to avoid missing any.\n\nIf you want to last hit back-line minions, you'll have to reposition ahead of the other minions. This really isn't a problem now though because they buffed his base stats to almost melee levels.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-10-31T10:48:42.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes there is often a bit of downtime, but you're forgetting that your 2 basic attacks damage the whole lane, so your bound to get a whole lot at low hp at once.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-10-31T13:28:01.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again assuming you have no actual control over the wave, this may be accurate, but you can angle yourself and the minions to choose if your hitting the minion wave or just one minion.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-10-31T23:02:36.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is of course assuming that the enemy laner just lets you position however you want...\n\ntheir job is to make it hard for you, just like its your job to make it hard for them.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-10-31T03:13:16.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's only your fault if you fuck up your CS as Graves.\n\nIt's as simple as playing around the knowledge that you have this auto attack reload.","replies":[]}]}
