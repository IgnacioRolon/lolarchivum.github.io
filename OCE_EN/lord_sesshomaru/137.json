So we wait over two years for something that was supposed to be free but instead they put a bullshit price tag behind it, meanwhile other servers got theirs for free, this is not being ungrateful, why should we be grateful for this? You're just one of those people that will blindly follow bullshit no matter what.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Æ’amous","date":"2015-09-29T11:57:04.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not saying I don't appreciate it. I don't think anyone is, but it's the fact we were basically conned into thinking this was going to be free, only to find out that because we've been given another skin, admittedly one I didn't even care for/want, for free, we wouldn't be getting our server skin for free, like every other server. I appreciate everything Riot does, but sometimes the way they go about things really bugs me. Like you couldn't tell us a year ago.. I'd happily swap the skin I've already received for free for the server one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-29T11:47:19.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes but at the end of the day every other region got there's for free so why not us","replies":[]}]}
