So riot was obviously aware of it way back then.\n\nBut that was 5 months ago, I know that there are more game-breaking bugs to fix that have priority, but 5 months?\n\nPersonally though, I&#039;m still waiting for this one to be fixed:\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/0Y2PKkKx-what-do-you-guys-think-of-this-bug\n\nThis kills me frequently.\nand it pisses me off, he already has so little counterplay.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-25T06:55:29.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on the bug, some are easy to nail down, some are weird spaghetti code interactions where they don't even know what's causing it. For the most part though, visual bugs that don't impact gameplay are pretty low priority, so they get fixed when someone has the time rather than on any sort of schedule.\n\nPast that, your guess is as good as mine. I know they have some sort of bug tracker, which pulls from reports from all over. I imagine they order it by priority as determined by severity and frequency and get to them that way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-11-25T06:47:35.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It takes no time at all to fix a bug of that minority, but they are too busy changing numbers for patches rather than actually fixing bugs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-11-24T23:15:33.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How long is a piece of string?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-11-24T23:19:34.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably a lot shorter than 5 months.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-11-25T00:15:34.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk man u seen those Victoria  ads on tv a while back.
