The classes are too contrary and complimentary to be balanced within a single champion.\n\nThe point of a fighter is to dish out damage all the way through a fight, but be tanky enough to live that long.\nWhere as an assassin deals mega damage to one target very quickly, and then either dies quickly themselves or gets the fuck out of the fight!\n\nThey couldnt be more different.\n\nSo it kinda defeats the purpose if you can delete squishes just as well as an assassin, but also be tanky enough to live through the fight while dealing constant sustained damage. How are you supposed to play against that?","replies":[{"poster":"Frost1c3","date":"2017-11-10T04:12:45.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only really thing that separates the two is mobility, asassins generally have some sort of dash or blink and generally lack cc (talking about abilites not items), if fighters like wu, garen and xin are doing well as assins that generally speaks about the items being over powered or that some effect is negating the difference, with wu and xin its the ability to dash and make use of on hits and then get out, also if you look most of these champs are AD which hints that its an AD item that is causing the issue...as you can guess I am talking about Duskblade. The concept isnt the issue, the damage, scaling and ability for none asassins to proc it is the issue. Basically go to a duskblade complaints thread and you will find your exact problem discussed over and over again. To me the fact that there is a \"need\" for dusk blade on AD assassins shows that they are poorly balanced (both the item and champs) and could probably be solved by making a new item that DOESN'T give lethality but does give a bonus that fixes the issue, or just take away the passive and fix assassins but that would needs time to settle since the preseason is here.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
