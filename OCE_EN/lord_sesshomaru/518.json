Then straight away bring out yet another month-long token grind, that forces you back into the base game.  Why?\r\n\r\nObviously some missions like destroy towers and such require normal game modes.  But for winning/dragons/playing/gold/etc. why doesn't TFT count for that?\r\n\r\nI couldn't earn enough tokens for the big prize the last 2 or 3 times.. and that was while I was mindlessly grinding only summoners rift games every day after work.  I'm definitely not going to make the goal now that I also want to play TFT...\r\n\r\nI dunno, seems counter productive to me.  Bring out a fun new game mode, then make players choose between new limited loot, and enjoying the new mode.  Could no one think up missions that can be completed evenly in both game modes?","replies":[]}
