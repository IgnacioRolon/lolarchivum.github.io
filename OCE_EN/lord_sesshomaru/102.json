[Discussion]","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"In the spirit of getting better, lets have a look at some of the things that hold us \nback in games. \n\nRealising and admitting to ourselves what it is that we do wrong is a big step towards correcting it.  So I thought it&#039;d be neat if we all shared and had a talk about what personally keeps us back as players. To help us grow and maybe more closely examine our mistakes and bad habits. Maybe even some tips and advice will come floating around. \n\n________\n\nI shall start then:\n\nThis is one of the things that i have trouble with, and feel impacts my game negatively:  When I play one of my top champions but don&#039;t do well. \nWhen I play one of my top champs in each role, I go in with the knowledge that I&#039;m not bad with that champion, thinking _&quot;Ive been playing Azir for over 2 years now, theres no reason I should lose to this Ahri that isn&#039;t even lvl 5 yet.&quot;_ Proceed to get face-rolled  _(get outplayed, or have bad map awareness etc)_. and then I get frustrated inside because I know I&#039;m better than this, then I start making mistakes by taking risks in order to _redeem_ myself, or get so far behind that i lose focus and just go on autopilot, which just leads to more mistakes. \n\nIts like because I&#039;m known for playing certain champs among my friends I feel the need to uphold that title of &quot;Good X champ player&quot; or something, and so when I do bad, I sometimes get that mental fog.\n\nIm sure everyone gets frustrated when they don&#039;t do well with champs they are good at, but I seem to be particularly susceptible to my own criticism in this situation. \nIts a pride issue i guess. xD\n\nAnyway thats one of the many thing things i need to work on :P\nanyone else care to examine themselves and share?\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-20T13:35:36.159+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can almost feel the tunnel vision/my circle of awareness shrinking.\n\nAs a support main this is most obvious when I play any lane where I have to CS (jungle isn't so bad for me). I don't have that middle ground where maybe I'm not aware as I should be, rather if I have to be csing, I'm not seeing anything else that isn't directly on my screen (and sometimes even less than that).\n\nAs soon as a fight gets intense I have 0 map awareness and even though I know I need to look at the map, my brain can't handle that much info. My biggest weakness is definitely tunnel vision. My overall awareness isn't bad but I'm not so good at multitasking.\n\nNo that it really bothers me all that much. I have my Gold rank for the skin and no real ranked ambition past that so I'm happy where I am.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-12-20T13:30:29.365+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is one of the reasons why i record games, so I can look back on them.\n\nI guess my main issues is not knowing how to deal with certain situations.\nI.E when they have a shaco with Ignite, that can 1 shot anyone of my carries, how do I peel against that.\nI don't because he can walk up without being seen.\nHow do I stop X champion, (Yasuo, Darius, Vayne etc) from literally 1 V 5ing my entire team.\n\nI guess my main issue, is just not knowing how to deal with fucking bull shit champions as a support.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-12-21T06:05:42.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"personally I feel shaco isn't that difficult to deal with (even when they're heaps better than me) but maybe that's just because I play alot of him. Which brings me to the point, the trick to countering a champion is to have played a fair bit of that champion and know exactly what they intend to do, only then can you have a true understanding of how to stop them from playing as they wish.\n\n This can involve knowing their pathfinding, knowing their cooldowns, damage, the speed at which they can unload that damage, counters, the timing they enter a fight, what cooldowns they're waiting for to be burned.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-12-21T09:35:22.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess that will help, I know what there abilities are and what they do.\n\nBut that doesn't stop me (As a support) from protecting my carries against an enemy I can't see.\nPinks (Control wards) and sweepers no longer reveal him. \nMeaning he can 1 shot anyone in the game and I can't stop that.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-12-21T10:14:44.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well good news for you, they're heavy nerfing ap shaco (the real 1shot terror) and slightly nerfing ad shaco (the more all round more duelist esque terror) soon, meaning it'll be much harder for him to 1shot.\n\nI can't honestly say ap shaco couldn't 1shot the adc before they could be peeled, but for most ad shaco's it takes a little longer to kill the adc which means that if you know when he's going to appear, it is possible to peel him off if you understand how he's going to use his ult and when he's going to go in.\n\nImo even though I main shaco (though everyone bans or dodges whenever I try to play him in ranked) I really really miss the old pinks and sweeper actually working on invisible champions. I mean upgraded red trinket works and so often it's actually a decent idea for the adc to pick this up against heavy invisibility based teams. The lack of counterplay around invisibility now is a bitch and even when I'm using it, I don't enjoy it because there is alot less tension and focus on clearing pink wards before a fight, nothing was more exciting than stealthing into a lane with fingers crossed that the lane bush didn't have a pink in it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ceness","date":"2016-12-21T01:49:24.828+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel that my biggest weakness is knowing how to play teamfights late game.
