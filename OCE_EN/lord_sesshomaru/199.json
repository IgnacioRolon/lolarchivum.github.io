However, they should still have to work for it! There should always be some level of counterplay where the victim can escape if they outplay the predator, _(you can cleanse Fizz&#039;s shark, Zhonyas Zed&#039;s ult, etc etc.) _\r\nTheres not much counterplay you can do in 0.00 seconds.\r\n\r\nOne of these pictures was me, _(the other was my friend in a different game)_, I was playing Azir in this particular game, and almost every time I knew that he was coming for me, so its not like I had no warning. I had my finger on my ult, and **as soon** as he became visible _(at the beginning of his jump)_, I pressed R.\r\nMy R activates while he is mid air, he lands, kills me, then the ult sweeps through and knocks him away.\r\n\r\nAzir&#039;s ult is supposed to be the ultimate disengage. If even that can&#039;t save you from something you **know** is coming, how are you supposed to counterplay it?\r\n\r\nThat stormrazor/duskblade combo is too strong.\r\nLike usual, items built as a crutch for ADCs, get abused by fighters and assassins.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2018-08-04T18:01:27.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your ult as Azir wont cancel damage that's already been initiated.\n\nYou might stop Rengar's leap, but you wont be stopping the damage from applying unless if you stun him or stop the leap between the 10% to 40% mark.

And it doesn't matter if your team kills him after he kills you. The assassin's job is to take out the high priority targets, once they have done that, they are expendable.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Junkerrr","date":"2018-08-04T01:33:42.776+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uhh, you can just dash away to your tower, and when you see him jump then just Zhonyas","replies":[]},{"poster":"Militant","date":"2018-08-11T06:25:16.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah thats tough.\nKeep in mind you're also a mage, you're physical res is basically 0, and there are loads of champs that can counter an assassin.
