Part 1","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find the characters and lore of Lol very inspiring and it is something i really enjoy being emerged in.\r\nMost people know the fundamentals of most champions lore (especially the big ones like Azir, Lissandra and Gangplank) But there are a few little quirky things that can be missed if you just play the champs for power and not for lore/personality like i do. \r\nso (providing i remember) i aim to share a few of the quirky things here from time to time.\r\nSo for the first instalment, here are a few neat facts about our much loved champs:\r\n\r\nAurelion Sol collects snow globes.\r\n\r\nJhin and Kindred hum exactly the same tune in game.\r\n\r\nThe sarcophagus that is fused to Xerath&#039;s body, once contained Brand. \r\n\r\nLissandra pre-dates the fall of Shurima, (making her older than both Xerath and Azir).\r\n\r\nBoth Teemo and Rumble have romantic feelings for Tristana.\r\n\r\nDespite being most notably affiliated with Icathia and the Void, both Malzahar and Kassadin are Shuriman by birth.\r\n\r\nJax&#039;s lore (like many other champions) is no longer canon, meaning that he is no longer (or never was as the case may be) the league&#039;s un-defeatable fighter, his reasons for using a lamppost are now also unknown.\r\n\r\nFizz is not a Yordle.\r\n\r\nThe binding that Yasuo ties up his hair with, is Shuriman.\r\n\r\nSome skin lines such as the Crimson Elite (and Pentakill if I&#039;m not mistaken) are canon to the original lol universe (i.e. not an alternative universe such as Blackfrost Anivia).\r\n\r\nFreljiord Ashe, Freljiord Taliyah, Pre-void Kassadin and Viscero Xin (among others), are also canon within their specific champion lores.","replies":[{"poster":"Mk2Chieftain","date":"2016-07-04T03:59:36.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jax's lore (like many other champions) is no longer canon, meaning that he is no longer (or never was as the case may be) the league's un-defeatable fighter, his reasons for using a lamppost are now also unknown.** <- This**\n\nNo IoW (Institute of War) means so many champions have no fit in the lore, others still are stand alones (Ryze, Nunu, Brand) and while they may have a case to be solo, it is kinda sad to see them with no relation to other champs.\nIn my opinion the lore is a jumbled mess that need to be sorted out.

The Institute doesn't exist anymore, nothing is canon, we'll fix it some day.\" \n\nHowever, I like to think that both the institute and the League of Legends were both disbanded due to conflict not really existing in Valoran now.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-04T08:31:44.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">However, I like to think that both the institute and the League of Legends were both disbanded due to conflict not really existing in Valoran now.\n\nWhile you can think that if you want, that isn't even canon, realistically the war wouldn't stop while a decent many of the champions are alive.\n\nThe new lore is great and all, but has no real reason to justify the deletion of the entirety of the old lore.","replies":[{"poster":"Corehog","date":"2016-07-05T10:22:59.632+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course it's not canon, I never claimed it was. \n\nBut, the war actually might have a brief cease fire:\n\n- At the moment, Swain not only respects, but fears Sona.\n\n- The Black Rose are currently working on not only on controlling Sion further, but also some other minor projects\n\n- Garen and Katarina respect each other enough to offer protection (goes so far as to attack their own people to protect the other)\n\n- There's currently two big threats apart from each other:\n                                                  -  The Void are potentially about to invade \n                                                  - The Shadow Isle has already invaded several times, but a big push just recently happened\n\n- Who knows what's going on at Mount Targon, but something is. Both nations could possibly be preparing for whatever does happen.\n\n- Ionia and Bandle City are somewhat aligned with Demacia. This makes Demacia a bigger threat then before to Noxus. Noxus may not want to fight such a threat.\n\n- Shits going down in the Freljord, Shurima and Bilgewater.

It must be horrible if your favourite champion is Jax or Fiddlesticks, who technically don't even have a backstory anymore, let alone cool interactions.\n\nThe institute of War was never the best idea to bind all the champs, (other games/movies have much better ways of bringing characters together). But at least it made some kind of sense. As it stands now there is no reason why Aurelion Sol (a majestic star dragon who creates galaxies for fun) should fight Teemo (a Yordle scout, with a blowgun) on top of a mountain just to destroy a big red or blue crystal. \n\nSummoner spells are called 'Summoner' Spells, many champions still say 'summoner' in game (and some even in champ select) So i think that some how or other, Summoners need to make a return in the Runeterra universe.\n\nThe lore needs to be sorted out like you say. There needs to be a reason why Brand is fighting Lucian on the rift and why Aurelion Sol is 1% of the size he should be. The new lores like the Shuriman and Targon ones are fantastic yes (with the exception of the Shadow Isles changes, i think those were all pretty shameful) its all very well having epic characters and awesome backstories, but the game is called 'League of Legends' and i don't see a league anymore, i see a whole lot of awesome characters that have no reason to be fighting eachother.\n\nLike Corehog said, having the IoW disbanded would make sense as long as they can fill the void of its existence with something else.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-04T09:20:06.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot have said that they no longer aim to give a reason as to why the fights are going on, or explain why things are as they are in game.\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/creative-spotlight/dev-blog-exploring-runeterra\n\n>At a very broad level, we’ve decided to push League’s story beyond its original focus on explaining in-game action and forge a new narrative path for Runeterra\nEssentially, it means that the game and story aren’t one-to-one copies of each other\n\nFact is this was mostly done to be able to change from having one universe where things needed to follow a logistical line of thought, to being able to make stand alone storys (like any of the current lore)\n\nEDIT: here is a comment that says it best\n\n>To an extent the gameplay and story will be separate. They're not totally separate, (for instance, Darius will always feel like Darius no matter where you see him, and the maps will always be evocative of actual places within the world) but there won't be an in-story justification for five unrelated champions tearing each other apart in the game over and over.\n\nThat's from Carnival Knights.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
