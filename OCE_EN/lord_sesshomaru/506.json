Azir is a zone control mage, once a target is outside the zone his damage is very low.\n\nIt wouldn't have mattered if you could react. Her stun counters your dash and she can chase past your flash. The only option is to use the wall, which I'm assuming you didn't have up because if you did then it is completely your fault for not mushing her face with it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-09-08T03:27:05.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I listened to my voice tho.\nGot me my first pentakill!\n\nily {{champion:222}}  <3 <3","replies":[]}]}
