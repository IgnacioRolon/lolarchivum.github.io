But I&#039;m sorry, I was too busy farming champions. \r\nIm not Yasuo, I cant 1-hit entire waves passively. I have mana and cool downs, I need to use spells to either clear or kill. Therefore one stat must suffer in order to support the other. :P\r\n\r\nA perfect game with half kill participation and double digits kills and assists.\r\nIs that honestly worth no more than an S-? \r\n\r\nBut is is still an S, so I cant really complain.\r\nI only put that in to soften you up for exhibit 2!\r\n\r\n_____\r\n\r\n**Exhibit 2:**\r\nMy friend&#039;s Evelynn game.\r\nhttp://imgur.com/a/nbC6m\r\n\r\nYes, again, the farm could have been higher, he admits it.\r\n\r\nBut basically 40 kills? not to mention only 6 deaths (for a remarkably squishy champion) in an hour long game? with 75% kill participation? _(honestly, how do you even get 75% kill participation in a 60 min game?)_\r\nNot even worth an A+\r\n\r\nAfter that, I actually pity Evelynn mains. Like seriously how many virgin souls do you have to sell to the devil in order to get lvl 6 or 7? When 39/6 is just an A...\r\n\r\nI know that the grade is based around average scores. But there needs to be some kind of fail-safe for after you get past a certain point, and enter the realms of ridiculous KDA. Where it just gives you S regardless of all your other stats like CS or vision.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-05-28T19:39:59.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a Level 7 Evelynn one-trick and, while I've never gotten 40 kills in a game (good on your friend xD), I am consistently getting S ranks. \n\n- I get 200-300 CS a game (usually end up with the most CS). \n- When I do die, my deaths aren't all clumped together (I think a certain number of deaths in a short time affects the grade). \n- I focus objectives. How many towers/inhibitors/dragons/etc. also plays a role in your grade. I had a game where I went 7/4 but because I literally took EVERY objective I still got an S. \n- WARDING. I bad with warding, but in a lot of my games, I'm still out-warding my support (warding also helps with the death thing mentioned above). \n- Gold. It's all well and good killing one person 50 times, but if they don't get a gold reset, they only give about 50-70g. While it may make your KDA look good, it won't give you much of a gold lead. \n\nThat's all I can think of. Hope this helps you (and your Evelynn friend) out :D Also, if you get 40 kills, you may want Mejai's xDDDDD","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-29T03:52:55.829+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My friend is already lvl 7 Eve, _(boy was it a slog though, i remember being in the games.)_\n\nBut he plays Eve like Shaco, he scouts out early kills and then snowballs from there, almost completely abandoning CS to help the team with lane dominance and objectives.\n\nall of that is goof advice though, ill show him your comment!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2017-05-29T01:25:24.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pre sure that the CS has to balance right with the KDA.\nAnd also taking the time into account, that and gold intake.\n\nSo your eve game:\n\n39/6/18\nWith 141 cs at 56:14.\n\n39 kill and 18 Assist is IMPRESSIVE.\n6 Deaths is jesus fuck, you pro.\n\nBut your CS is shit, IK you said you were 'Farming Champs', but you are to have like at least over 200 cs at 35 minutes or less.\nSo really your downfall is your CS in this scenario.\n\nYour Lux game is something I'm trying to get over doe xD\n\n\nAlso you gotta check out your average KDA and compare that to your game KDA that you got.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-29T03:50:13.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, but my point is that if you do have 40 kills.\nCS shouldn't even matter.\n\nand it was my friends Eve game haha \nI cant play her for shit :P","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2017-05-29T23:59:34.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=f7XYdE22,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-05-29T03:50:13.720+0000)\n>\n> Yea, but my point is that if you do have 40 kills.\n> CS shouldn&#x27;t even matter.\n\nSadly CS will matter.
