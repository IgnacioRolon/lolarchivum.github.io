Kindred used to have a charge based heal in her kit. Too op they said and reworked it.... into a fucking rune. She used to have on hit % based health damage... Too op riot said... but vayne,kog and kaisai still have theirs. Her w her q had a 2 second cool down at lvl1 which had solid counter play but they nerfed that too and that makes her one of the weakest junglers / prone to getting counter jungled and her whole theme was getting marks... in the enemy jungle... Which you could hold ransom for up to 5 minutes.\n\nLet's face it. Kindred was the champ riot never wanted. Ranged jungle adc who isn't graves and the way the have handled her has been terrible... but better rework Ryze for the 5th time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-04-09T12:41:06.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally don't feel like kindred is weak, just doesn't fit very well into the current meta. Though the only problem I see with them is that they rely too much on stacking and the enemy has too much information about where those stacks are. Often times the enemy can react before kindred can. I'd say if they want to 'fix' kindred then they should give her like a 10-second head start on where marks appear. Though imo that already sounds like a very strong buff to her playstyle.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-04-09T14:58:06.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never said she was weak.\n\nLike any marksman, given the right situation she's awesome!\nShe's just bloody f*cking annoying to play.\n\nFirst of all, the Jungler position is an early game one. Like all marksman, her strength definitely lies in the late game. So not only is she weaker in the _early game_ than other junglers _(obviously you cant have a late game hyper carry having a strong early game as well)_, which feels bad enough, but she is also pressured into going places that force a confrontation between her and the enemy _(who unless they are a shitty jungler, (and unless the mark is scuttle crab) will ALWAYS reach her mark first.)_\n\nHer movement speed is one of the lowest in the game _(unlike most other junglers)_, and her marks always spawn on the side of the map where her enemy is going to be anyway. Which would be fine if her marks felt worthwhile going for, but they don't. The old marks gave a clear, visible, effect: you now do X% more damage, you knew that with 12 marks, you'd do approximately 12% HP damage. The new ones are so convoluted that you don't see or feel their effect, you know they make you stronger statistically, but you don't notice any difference, and the one part you do notice _(the range increase)_ only happens every now and then. and even then, the range increase is more of a token thing than a practical one. She needs 20 marks just to match Caitlin's range _(I dunno about you, but I've never seen a Kindred get 20 marks)_.\n\nYes she's very strong in late game, but in the early and mid game _(when a jungler is supposed to be useful)_ the disadvantages are stacked way too much against her. That doesn't necessarily make her weaker, it just makes her very frustrating to play.\n\nAnd on top of it all, her gank potential is mediocre at best, she gets one minor slow and thats it, most mid-lane roams are more effective than her ganks. So not only does she feel unable to hunt her marks in the jungle, but she also finds it difficult to secure them from ganks as well. and if your laners don't have your back 100% when you gank, she gets bursted down instantly.\n\n___________________\n\nIm not saying to buff her, every champ needs strong and weak phases, and its cool and unique to have a marksman jungle, but you can move her strengths and weaknesses around to make her still balanced, but less 'smash your head against a brick wall' to play.\n\nAs it stands, why pick Kindred over Twitch?\nWhat can she do that he cant?\nHis invis makes ganking more successful. His DPS is greater than hers. He doesn't have to run headlong into Kha'Zix patrolled jungle camps just to get marks that feel worthless.\n\nApart from her ult, theres nothing she can do that a Twitch or Graves or Kai'Sa jungle can't do just as well or better, and for a lot less effort.\n\nSorry for the rant, I just love that champ, but it just feels so stink playing her, when it didn't used to before the rework. The current meta certainly doesn't help of course, but tbh for an early-game marksman in a jungle stalked by assassins and fighters, there is never going to be a meta where she isn't more prey than predator, _(which sucks seeming her whole thing is that she's supposed to be the grim reaper)_.\n\n\n____________________\n\nAs just a random suggestion, maybe take some of the power away from obtaining the marks, and give it to the mark itself.\n\nWhen you're hunted by Rengar or Warwick and you see that symbol above your head, your thoughts are:\n_\"FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK RUUUUUUUUUUNN!!!!!!\"_\n\nWhen youre marked by Kindred **(THE GRIM REAPER)**, your thoughts are:\n_\"Ehhh.. I hope she doesn't kill me, cos then she'll get a mark.\"_\n\nMaybe turn the mark itself into some kind of specific debuff? so that her target actually feels hunted, marked junglers maybe have to think twice about seeking her out in the jungle, marked laners are maybe a little more wary of being ganked. Make them feel like prey.\n\nHer whole story is about choosing your death, by the arrow or by the teeth. Maybe her playstyle should reflect that? Marked targets should have to make the choice of either turning to face her in battle, or running for their damn lives.","replies":[]}]}]}
