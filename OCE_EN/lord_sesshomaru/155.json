This tells us that whatever his current position in the meta, 50% of the community hate that champion. So 11% of the population love him, 50% hate him, and 39% don&#039;t care either way. \n\ni just want to re-itterate: 50% of the community HATES Zed. \n\nTaric wasn&#039;t hated at all, neither was poppy, or Sion, admittedly they weren&#039;t &#039;loved&#039; (although ill admit to taric being my main supp since S4) but unlike Zed they weren&#039;t &#039;Hated&#039; yet these non-hated champs were still removed and replaced with new ones. \n\nif you do that to a champ just because they weren&#039;t liked as much as other champs, why wont you do it to a champ that people actually Hate?\n\nSo what shall we do about this? Lets change Zed (it doesn&#039;t need to be drastic) so that more people like him and less people hate him. \n\nSound fair?\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-04-16T07:46:05.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**the meta is verging back to the tank meta**\n\nits more like the adc in every role meta.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-04-16T09:21:09.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ADC updates made it an ADC meta, and because there were so many ADC's more people played Assassins to counter the ADC's, so then more people played Tanks to counter the assassins, and now people are playing more ADC's again to counter the tanks.\n\nBut i also am against having 3 ADC's in the game..","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-04-16T10:09:30.691+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it kinda annoys me in lane, but then when start to spike on a tanky champ you realise just how over powered base damage tanks are.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-04-16T10:07:03.928+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i hate zed because he so fuckin spammed in every game, i dont even play mid in norms anymore. 130 champions yet if you play mid in normals nine out of ten games you will be playing against {{champion:103}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:99}} . rip variety, rip exciting gameplay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-04-16T08:10:43.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think a 50% ban rate means people \"hate\" Zed. It could just be that they respect his power and don't want to see him in the game. I imagine Teemo's ban rate would be much higher than whatever it is if people simply banned champs they hated.\n\nAlso, I don't think Taric, Poppy, Sion or any other reworked champion was changed because of people's attitudes towards that champion. They were changed because their balancing issues were so great that only major changes could bring them to a point where Riot could work with them.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-04-16T09:19:13.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If most people don't want to see him in their game, isn't that a fair enough reason to change him?\n\nTaric/poppy/sion were changed because they were unpopular and weren't making money. They were outdated visually and so no new skins could be made for them that would be up to the standards of modern skins, and so no one played them (because why play a badly modelled champ with 10 voice lines when you could play Aurelion Sol or Azir or Ekko, or one of the new shiny champs.) and if no one plays them and no more skins can be made for them, they have to update them in order to make money.

When they were first made, they were right on the nail of where they were put. However, as the game grew and the metas changed, these champs found it difficult to get along and found themselves in the niche cupboard and only being brought out for specific comps. The ban rate isn't enough to justify a rework. The pick rate, win rate, and general age of the champion are just some of the indicators that can show where a champ is.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AlphaCueSlowly","date":"2016-04-16T07:17:27.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly, i'm not a Zed player, never was, never will be.

LeBlanc and Zed on the other hand, while needing a high skill-ceiling to make faker level plays, have more basic abilities and are far less complicated, while also having an increased level of safety that prevents them from being punished. Their safety is the only reason they are hated and honestly I would totally rather they deal more damage than having the amount of escapes they do.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-04-16T07:38:08.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zed's overall win rate has been sitting pretty stable at around [50% for the past couple of weeks](http://www.lolking.net/champions/zed?chartType=winrate&region=na&map=sr&queue=ranked&league=ranked#statistics), only (barely) dipping below that about five times. If we are comparing ranks, [he is only below 50% in bronze. \n](http://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/zed/bronze)\n\nThe 65% ban rate in [bronze](http://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/zed/bronze) /[ silver](http://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/zed/silver) / [gold ](http://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/zed/gold)can be explained by the attitudes towards high skill cap champs at lower levels of play. People don't want one on their team out of fear that they will go full potato (legitimate concern, happens often enough). People also worry that their team will be unable to shutdown a zed if he manages to get snowballing, as it does take a lil bit of communication, something that may not be easy in this sort of elo. \n\nThe[ plat 62% zed ban rate](http://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/zed/platinum) is probably due to some of the lower elo reasons, as well as the fact that Zed is generally annoying to deal with. He has high wave clear and ranged harass, tonnes of burst potential (especially with duskblade), so instead of having to deal with that, they just take the easy way out of banning him (applies to all levels of play).\n\nThe [diamond+ ban rate is quite a bit lower (but still very high), at 56%](http://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/zed/diamond). According to [LoLskill](http://www.lolskill.net/top/highest-lolskillscore?filterChampion=238&filterRealm=OCE), Zed is still a pretty popular OCE high elo pick with some players pulling out 70+% win rates over a large number of games. Due to the population of high elo players being smaller, some high elo players may be a little apprehensive to leave zed open in the likely chance they will run into one of the god-tier zed mains. \n\nHe's still a super fun champion with a good kit, he just isn't the kind of champ people want in their competitive games.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-04-16T09:13:08.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what you're saying is that in every rank he is banned in over half of all games!\nNothing can justify that, if a champion is so overly un-wanted, then theres something amiss.\n\nFirstly, he's not exactly a highskillcap champ, especially not when compared to Azir and Syndra etc. Like lee sin, people tell themselves that Lee is hard to play so that they feel good while playing him, its the same with Zed.\n\nSecondly its not fair to players that they have to waste a ban every game on Zed.\n\nThirdly its not fair if Zed is your favourite champion because you'll never be able to play them in ranked (which is a huge disadvantage, because lets be honest here, many Zed players pretty much ONLY play Zed.) \n\nYou mention in all elos that people just don't want to deal with him, so shouldn't something be done so that the Zed players can play their ninja, while the regular players don't have to sigh in pain every time he gets picked?\n\nYou say he's a super fun champion, but from whose perspective? Pretend youre in a COD game where everyone has a knife except for one guy with a rocket launcher with unlimited ammo, sure its super fun for him, but everyone else gets sick of it pretty damn quickly. Its the same in lol people stop finding him fun when he appears suddenly in the middle of your team, deletes your ADC then suddenly evaporates again out of sight. That gets real old really quickly (for everyone except the Zed) \n\nyou say that people don't want him in their competitive games, Lol IS a competitive game, millions and millions are spent on world championships, if a champion isn't wanted in competitive play you might as well delete them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-04-16T07:05:02.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot are gonna update Assassins.\n\nJust wait.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-04-16T12:27:46.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JustTrash,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=AEJEk3fI,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-04-16T07:05:02.044+0000)\n>\n> Riot are gonna update Assassins.\n> \n> Just wait.\n\nI'd prefer if they nerfed Grasp of the Undying, Iceborn Gauntlet, reverted those Zed nerfs.
