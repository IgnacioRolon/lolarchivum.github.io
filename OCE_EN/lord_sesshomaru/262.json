This was really only playing Galio though, and his shield is more a there or not rather than something like Morg's where you really want an idea of how big it is.\n\nI didn't like the colour, and certainly I felt it could have been better visibility wise but it didn't feel like it was a massive problem. Given it was an easy fix though, glad they just got it out of the way.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-04-06T22:40:03.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does make the shield more visible. It constrasts with the green so you can see it. I never realised just how big the maw shield was until it started popping up purple on a riven.
