Full stop.\n\nWhy do Fizz and Kassadin, and even Zed negate unit collision? they are literally the most mobile champions in the game due to their insane number of dashes anyway, and their playstyles consist of literally _&#039;Click on enemy. Press every button.&#039;_ why do they need that?\n\nMeanwhile, create a champion whose entire reason for existence revolves around pin-point precise movement commands, and make him have to blunder through every fucking minion in the lane...\n\nHe&#039;s a space dragon, half the size of a mountain, comprised entirely of etherial star dust, that hovers without ever even touching the ground, yet manages to trip over tiny little midgets. When a Sea kind-of-yordle who barely reaches knee hight, has no problem whatsoever clambering over them.\n\nIt&#039;s not like it&#039;d make him broken or anything..\nHe is weaker in almost every single way, has more counterplay, and is harder to play than any of those 3 champs. \nIf you took unit collision away from any of them, they probably wouldn&#039;t even know, _(hell I bet most Zeds don&#039;t even realise they have it in the first place)_. Why do they have it if it has absolutely no relevance to their kit, its just pointless strength. While the champ that needs it the most desperately in the whole game, can&#039;t have it, not even through items... \nYou have to sacrifice either flash or ignite to get it, and even then, it&#039;s only once every 3 minutes.\n\nIf you miss a star, it&#039;s a LONG time between your last one, and the next one. It is incredibly punishing. and on a champion who is so easy to punish in the first place too. Ive lost so many fights and lost so many kills, just becasue I have the perfect trajectory for my next star, and a minion _(either mine or the enemy&#039;s)_ decides that it wants to move, and runs between my legs. and when you do get unit collision, its basically a snare, as you watch Sol put on his backpack and take a hike 3km around the circumference. _(assuming he doesn&#039;t just sit and vibrate in place that is, while the game strains itself trying to decide to path left or right, and successfully manages to do neither.)_\n\n**Very few champs lose out on 1/3 of their DPS because they happen to stray to close to a minion...**\n~~Why should Sol~~ Why should _**any**_ champ have to contend with that?\n\n______________________________\n\nGive me a reasonable explanation why they have it, and he doesn&#039;t. \nI dare you Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-05-30T11:43:29.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played this guy in ARURF and he is tricky to pilot - he's like a jumbo jet","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-05-30T02:23:22.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Half the size of a mountain????

They either keep him that way or they make him broken, meaning they'd have to nerf him to shit or let him be op. Avoiding minions is like one of the only skill caps he has.
