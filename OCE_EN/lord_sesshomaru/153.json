Lucian will also poke and use his mobility to avoid hooks. \n\nLeona and Alistar want that hook so that they can jump onto the enemy ADC, thresh simply has to outplay Blitzcrank. Janna will throw her tornado, Zilean and Zyra will harass with high AP ratios and stuns. \n\nThere's too many to name, but you play to the strengths of your champion.\n\n\nBlitzcrank is a very binary champion who has a pull and only a knock up for CC. His silence is a bit too short i think to make a real difference though its a little bursty. Compare him to thresh, Tahm kench, Lulu, he has very little room for play making potential. He isn't tanky without building tanky support items.  He can only really make a play if he lands a hook.

It's best to lose the exp and gold rather than give them an extra 15 minions worth of gold at the same time as costing yourself more. \n\nSecondly, Caitlynn laying traps in the bushes and harassing blitz with her AA over the minion wave should in fact shove blitz back. You don't have to worry about trading, if Ezreal tries to make a play, use Taric's stun or Caitlynns trap (if you're skilled enough) to stun/snare him, so that he will take damage. You don't have to kill him, just hurt him so much that staying in lane is detrimental. Use your Q to harass Ezreal the much squisher ADC as it has a much wider hitbox, odds are he'll have to blink to avoid it which has a long cooldown. \n\nAs an ADC you don't stop moving, keep moving between AA's that way you can avoid the volley's being fired at you since they are skill shots that cost mana and travel in a linear direction. Don't focus blitzcrank unless he screws up at the start of the game and or hasn't build tank items throughout. \n\nFurthermore, don't run in a straight line knowing blitz has his hook up, if you move side to side very quickly while running he will most likely miss as it has a very small width.

Learning to avoid skill shots is a fundamental mechanic of league of legends on many champions. Hell if you can't dodge a blitzcrank hook I don't know what hope you have against a thresh or a leona or a nautilus. Thresh and Nautilus's hook are much wider and Leona's Zenith blade bypasses minion waves and hits the last champion in its range pulling her to him.\n\nI'll tell ya, blitzcranks hook each time he fires it, at level 1 he's drained a whole third of his mana in one go, his hook is down for approximately 15 seconds, meaning he is partially useless for that entire period. If you're set to go in on a full engage, do it when blitzcrank misses because then the most he can is ult and knock up if he can even get close to you before his ADC comes to the risk of dying.

It also doesn't curve, it just has to connect with the hit box. If it connects with a minions hitbox, then it will always pull the minion, if it connects with your hitbox it will always pull you. To put it simply the actual size of the hitbox is actually something you can't see. The hook might go in between minions it would never go through. \n\nBlitzcrank's hook is very linear and thin, Thresh's hook while slow is a lot wider than Blitzcrank's hook.\n\nIf your adc isn't within the minion wave, then they are playing poorly, if Leona got pulled from out of reach of the minion wave then that's a really bad call. \n\nxD I'm sorry but the information you're presenting is that you make stupid mistakes. If you don't make the aforement mistakes then Blitzcrank's ADC is very dead as he doesn't have the CC to peel as well as other.\n\nFurthermore Alistar's combo is stronger than Blitzcranks, Alistar's proper combo is a point and click when performed properly is utterly inescapable, where as with blitz you can still dodge the hook regardless. \n\nBlitzcrank is not as OP as some people here are trying to make him out to be.  Not to mention Blitzcrank's silence is extremely short. \n\nand finally thresh's hook is an actual stun, yes it's CC, if you get pulled by this you are more likely to die here than by a blitzcrank pull because it's very hard to escape thresh due to his actual stun mechanics, his flay throwing you back and his ultimate box. He also has the versatility to save allies, provide a small shield, and become tanky without actually building tank. His auto attack is a pseudo melee ranged attack where he can harass over minion lines.\n\nI main {{champion:412}} and  {{champion:89}} and currently is a level 5 {{champion:53}}  as well.

You see there is no specific counterplay to beat any champion, it requires a multitude of different decisions made during champion select, early lane minion wave control, how to trade, item build paths, previous experience and many other factors. This is why many favour \"stable\" adc picks like cait, luc and ez , if you are not confident enough in your mechanics to dodge blitz hooks ( which means you shouldnt confident enough to position correctly and dodge other forms of CC ) then don't play Jhin, Ashe, Varus , Kogmaw , *insert other adc that has low mobility* unless your support is going to play something tanky who can body block/peel etc.\n\nTry looking up blitzcrank videos on youtube.\n\nWhenever someone makes any suggestion you reply back with \"oh but then this champ can do x, and what if im first pick and why do i choose x champ when y hasn't even been locked in. Maybe if you posted from your main account people could gauge what level of understanding you really have of the game, instead of hiding behind a lvl 9 alt.

So what we do in champion select is not an option for counterplay.\n\nIn game there are certain ways of counter-playing a champ/situation, as all (or most) other champs.\n\nFor example, to counter a Aurelion Sol gank (when he comes flying in with a lane wide stun) is to land a (preferably) long range ability on him as soon as he gets in range, this will immedialty stop his E a fair distance away from you. You will likely be stunned, but it should have worn off by the time he walks to you now.

Again this is a situation that obviously frustrates people, but it has clear counterplay, just like the Sol ganks.\n\nTo play agent kindred's ult, you Zhonya's just after it begins, and as soon as Zhonya's ends, you ignite her and that way, you get the full heal while taking no damage, and she only gets half the heal. Or if you're not a mage then you just don't use your cc until it ends then stun her, (or better, knock her out of her ult just before it ends) \n\nTo counter taric's ult, as soon as you see it happening, disengage the fight, they will want to chase you (so that they dont feel that they wasted it) and just before it ends, you turn around, and go all in on them.\n\nAll champions have (or at least should have) ways to play around their abilities In a certain situation. Ways that don't require a certain champ for it to be a success (obviously some champs make it easier to counter, and some make it harder, but the same logic still applies) \n\nwhat i wan't to know, is how to play agent this situation AS ANY CHAMP (yes even if they aren't tanky) and that isn't just 'oh well dodge the hook, duuhuhaha' \n\n'Dodging' isn't counterplay, dodging is something you try to do to EVERY enemy skillshot that gets thrown at you its not counter play, its just trying to to die, like 'running away' you cant say 'he's fed, oh well just run away! duhuaha' because running away is obvious and you do it to everyone when you're in danger. \n\nI want to know the specific counterplay for this situation.\n\n[EDIT]: An example of the difference between counter-picking and counter-play\n\nThe enemy has a Zed. If the Zed picks before you in champ select, you can pick a champ like Kayle, to counter his ult.\n\nIf you pick before the Zed (and as such, don't pick kayle) it doesn't mean you're fucked for the rest of the game. it just makes it harder to play against him. But you can still do it by waiting for him to use his ult, and the instant he becomes targetable again after it, you flash and or dash away which means he has to use his W to chase you (if its not on cd) instead of doing more damage to you, which cuts a significant portion out of his ult damage. \n\nOr if you want to duel him to the death, when he ults you, you run back to the point where he cast it, so that you can duel him there without him zapping back out of the fight as soon as he is in danger. \n\nNow if you did pick kayle, obviously its easier to counterplay him because your ult counters him. But if youre not kayle the same logic still applies.\n\nTHAT is what i want again blitz, not what champion to pick.

During a real professional game both teams discuss strategy and pick based on what comp they would like to run. They don't sit there saying \" oh man blitz has no counterplay we should instant lock him\". If its a blind? Well tough luck, that's not what the game is balanced around. Why do you think Riot have pushed DQ so hard?\n\nDodging is counterplay, positioning is counterplay. The selection of champion is counterplay. It is actually you who doesn't get it. If you cant dodge a hook then how are you going to dodge a wrench?\n\nHow do you think people play mid? They learn how to dodge skill shots, it is a fundamental part of the game. How is it that hard to understand?

Why is that so difficult for you to understand??\n\nDodging isn't counterplay, its an expected move that you are supped to be doing to every single champion with a skillshot. Its like Moving and farming, youre just expected to try to dodge something if it comes at you. Counterplay is something specific to a champion or situation where you do a specific move that counters theirs, Dodging is not a counter, blitz tries to pull you, you try to dodge it, if youre the same skill level its a 50/50% chance that it will hit to not (cos he isn't going to fire his hook unless he thinks he can get you) \nif it misses then you capitalise, and if it hits you die. Thats not counterplay, thats capitalising on a mistake. You're supposed to do that on every champ. \n\nChampion specific counter-play is not dodging, its knowing what to do (and doing it) one you already get in a sticky situation. Like the Zed ult example we just talked about. You cant counterplay a zed ult until he has used it. Its the same with blitz, he fires the hook, you try to dodge it, if it hits you, THEN you adjust your play to try and counter the situation, for example use the new circumstance to go all in on the adc or something like that.\n\nI know how mid laners play, i happen to be one. But Dodging a skillshot isn't counterplay, take Azir for example, he places a soldier and Q's you, dodge it if you can, but its pretty fast and fairly wide, and at a close rang its pretty hard to miss (take it from an azir main). So lets pretend we got hit by it, what can we do in this situation to turn it around in our favour? Well he now has his soldier away from him, so if you dash in close, he cant do anything for a good couple of seconds. We have now turned the situation around (counterplay).\n\nLike Aurelion Sol, Sure try dodge the stars as much as you want, but its better to take one to the face and get in close to him where he is useless, than it is to sit on the outer ring dodging stars all day. \n\nSo as you can see, dodging and counter playing are different things.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-05-02T03:52:28.386+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"play thresh","replies":[]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-05-02T12:53:45.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Take Morgana, Blitz rendered useless for the rest of the game, problem solved.\n\nOr you could use a scrying orb in the bush.\n\nOr a tanky champ could facecheck it.\n\nOr you could go do krugs until the wave pushes back towards your tower. \n\nOr you could call the jungler over to help break the freeze.\n\nOr Ban blitz.\n\nOr get a Banshees Veil.\n\nThere's 1000000 solutions, but it all depends on what compositions you have, and what stage of the game it is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-05-01T21:14:25.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ward the bush.
