Pissing off half your team in the process, and bringing down a &#039;Boy who cried wolf&#039; situation upon yourself, further hindering both you and your team&#039;s playing.\n_______\n\n**So, my theoretical question is:**\nWhat is less harmful for your team? And what would you prefer in game?\n\n1. Someone who misses a MIA every now and then, \n2. or someone who cries Wolf every 30 seconds?\n\nNeither are helpful, both are just as vague for team communication.\nIts an interesting question, _(at least I think so)_, and I don&#039;t really know what the answer is myself. What do you all think?\n\n_Obviously having good map awareness solves 90% of the problems anyway, so yelling at someone for not calling MIA is just admiting that you have bad awareness, but that&#039;s beside the point, for this discussion anyway._","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-05-01T01:17:09.577+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I don't know why people feel the need to ping multiple times for one thing. I've never really had a problem pinging just once.\n\nThe way I handle it is that I'll ping (only once) if they're missing for more than 10-15 seconds (or 20-30 if I know they've backed). I'll also ping straight away if they appear to be roaming or going for Drag, hoping that my team mates wont get caught in a bad position when they arrive.\n\nThing is, I've encountered players who will adamantly claim that someone didn't ping MIA even though they did, and when told to read the chat logs they start up on claims that they're being abused by everyone else on the team. Most of the time I come across this issue it's just people who are looking for a reason to b!tch, so nothing to do other than report and move on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tomblade","date":"2017-05-01T01:00:52.157+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is just my personal opinion as a lowly Silver/bronze player:\n\nI would say no.1. \n\nDon't spam your pings because it's very annoying for your teammates and moves the focus away from the match, to the frustration coming across in your ping-spam. It hurts team morale more than the guy who complains \"WTF NO MIAS\" because let's be honest, the rest of the team (and yourself) know it's their own damn fault for not warding/map awareness etc.\n\nIn saying that, I feel that sending pings/signals to your teammates effectively is part of being a good team player. I try to track jungler appearances, lane ganks - even when it isn't my lane. When I see them on the mini map and notice danger for my top laner, I ping it - even when I'm eg: botlane.\n\nBlaming your teammate \"WTF MAYTE NO MIA NOOB\" is pretty ironic because not being able to read your lane/mini map/wards is actually, a misplay on the that individual's part. They are the noob at that moment.\n\nBeing pinged a potential MIA should be seen as more a courtesy (yes it helps a lot, but shouldn't be expected at least not in soloQ) and if you get ganked, that's on you. Just like when players get solo-killed by their laner and say \"WTF JUNGLER YOU USELESS\" as you're 3/0 taking bot turret and get dragon and rotate to mid and get that turret too....\n\nI've had people say \"WTF NO MIA\" even though I have pinged the MIA. And I tell them to read the chat (because it says \"X signals that enemies are missing\") and they've responded with more anger and things like \"HOW AM I SUPPOSE TO KNOW YOU WERE PINGING ME??????\" lol!\n\nI guess some players are just angry in general and desperately looking for someone/something else to blame.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-05-01T05:32:07.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't ping non stop when they go missing, you ping lane then the direction you saw them leave then if its been over 5 sec and they haven't come back give 2 quick danger pings to their lane then ping mia again, that it a thorough alert and if they don't listen its their problem, but if its a tf, ping mia like crazy and warnings to whichever way he went. And if enemy backs and does not return within 18 seconds of backing usually is cause for 2 or 3 mia in your lane.\n\nYou aren't crying wolf, you are just alerting to danger, better safe than sorry. Plus more foten than not if they see you follow them towards the way they went they will double back to lane, unless they are mobile enough to get there before you're anywhere near.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AvK Ðęlµxe ąƒ","date":"2017-05-01T03:45:14.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I may fall into the category of the boy that cried wolf occasionally... because as soon as my enemy is out of sight, I mia ping once... if they've gone for 2-3 minion deaths, i'll mia ping twice... and if they've gone for a bit longer than that, after the double ping, i'll danger ping the other lanes once... on the occasion that I mia ping, and suddenly my enemy laner is in my lane, I have a macro that says: \"cancel dat ping on aisle 5 - soz\". But I do like to ping, I'll double ping if I see the enemy jungler headed somewhere... making the 2nd ping go in that location... I ping ward locations if I spot it... I ping dragon/baron if all is too quiet and my spider sense tingles... I ping brushes because I'm certain someone is in there... I even ping my mum sometimes.

If they are gone and you think they've gone b, but you didn't see it, just ping it once or twice. If you know they're roaming to x lane, whether you follow or not, ping the MIA once or twice and ping a danger at where their headed. If they generally disappear, wait a few seconds, then ping it, they may have just backed up a bit.\n\nI find this usually communicates things pretty well, and even if they don't end up roaming, prompting your team when your laner has gone b encourages them to be more aware of the map, if only for a short while, so really it's a win win.\n\nI don't think spam pinging really has any place. Twice to be sure, three times if it's urgent, but anything more than that is getting excessive. If your team isn't seeing pings at the third one, then frankly that's a them problem and they should turn their ping volume up or something, and nothing you can do will help them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2017-04-30T14:59:45.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I choose the third option.\n\nmap awareness or gtfo","replies":[]}]}
