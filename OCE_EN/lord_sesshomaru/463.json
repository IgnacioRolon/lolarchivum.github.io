She is already at a major disadvantage by being a squishy mage with no dashes, while they are Assassins pure-bred to kill her. All that happens is that she just gets absolutely blitzed by them every time. Why give them so much advantage?\n\nKindred has to constantly invade the enemy jungle, and the enemy knows exactly where she will be, she has to walk twice the distance than her opponent to get there, during a time when she is at her weakest, and she still has less move speed than already strong junglers like Lee Sin and Yi and Rengar. Honestly, what do you expect her to be able to do?\n\nI can understand giving artillery champs like Azir and Lux lower move speed because it&#039;d be dumb if they never had to be near the fight in the first place, but still had an easy time getting away _(cough Xerath 340 ms cough)_. But it makes no sense to give extra mobility to those who are already the most mobile in the game, like Akali and Lee and Riven.\n\nWhy?\nI just want to know your reasoning behind this decision.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-09-24T05:51:36.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:82}}  has biggest boots in the game.... 325 ms\n\nseems about right.","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2017-10-01T07:48:04.628+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but his armour is thicc af so it slows him down.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Plasmarine","date":"2017-10-01T07:32:20.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every single one of the first 11 champions you mentioned are melee.

And for a champion whose entire kit revolves around moving, you need every bit of speed you can get.\n\nThats true about eve, but she doesn't have in-combat mobility the same way Kat or Lee does. In my opinion Evelynn is a very good example of how a champ should be  in terms of map-pressure vs combat strength. The point of Evelynn is not to be good in a fight, her point is to give her team map pressure. She's fast and shes invisible, and thats a scary thing.\n\nIn reality she comes into lane and gets burst down immediately. But its the fear of her that makes her useful.\n\nThe problem is, Lee Sin is just as fast as Eve, but he's way better in a fight.\nSo he contributes a similar amount of pressure, but is also much more useful in other situations.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-09-24T02:35:45.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can tell ya, Diana, Rengar and Vi feel incredibly slow when you play them, especially when you're against their usual competition (from a jungler's perspective).\n\nKindred needs low movement speed because she's ranged and the way her kit plays out.\nIf you've seen a fed Kindred, you'll realise you don't want to see that moving at Pantheon's speed.\n\nAnivia, Ziggs and Xayah are very AoE centered, having LARGE area denial, and the ability to say \"you step in this zone here and you're fucked\".\nLike you said, Xerath has amazing long range power and the movespeed at the same time, though to be fair his bread and butter slows him to a crawl and his ultimate has him standing still.\n\nMordekaiser... he needs something, really the only one here I agree completely with, he's too slow, his kit is very much lumber towards the opponent and smack them slowly, he needs SOMETHING.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nBiggest problem here is that you're focusing too much on a singular piece of a champion's kit than their entire puzzle.\n\nOn paper Rengar and Diana have high mobility, but in practice they are pretty much jump in and succeed or you die/nothing happens.\nRengar especially, if you're knocked back by a Janna ult or Vayne Condemn, you're not reaching your target again, you wont be able to catch them.\n\nWhile champions like Aurelion Sol have very safe (if boring and uninspiring) kits, that allow them to deny large areas of play, typically around themselves, but have the draw back of slower movespeed to compensate.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-09-24T03:26:52.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I can tell ya, Diana, Rengar and Vi feel incredibly slow when you play them, \n\nIll gladly trade 'actually being slow' for 'feeling slow' any day.\n\n> If you've seen a fed Kindred, you'll realise you don't want to see that moving at Pantheon's speed.\n\nI dont want a pantheon coming at me at pantheon's speed!\n\nAgreed a fed Kindred is a scary thing _(as a kndred player, I know)_, but so is a fed Kat, and a fed Yasuo, and a fed Riven.\nThe difference being: that you don't see many fed Kindred's, because no one plays kindred, because nearly every jungler in the game does the same job but better. Apart from late game damage, Kindred doesn't actually offer much to the team, her ganks are lacklustre, her counter jungling is predictable, she can't solo objectives early. But jungling is an early game position, the point of a jungler is to win early game and get your lanes and objectives ahead, having a jungler that is only worth her salt in late game isn't actually much of a help.\n\n> Anivia, Ziggs and Xayah are very AoE centered, having LARGE area denial, and the ability to say \"you step in this zone here and you're fucked\".\n\nKatarina, Ekko, Zed, etc all have very proficient area denials as well. Katarina puts areas off limits way harder than Ziggs or Xayah does. But she's still allowed instant blinks and high ms.\n\nMordekaiser is the one and only champ in the game that I fully support a rework for. Everyone else _(strong or weak, underplayed or overplayed)_ at least has a clear idea of where they fit into the game. Morde just has no idea at all, the only efficient way to play Morde is as the farming half of a duo lane, _(and unless you want a very angry marksman on your ass)_ ADC is the only role that fits into, and quiet frankly there could be no worse position to take him in than in a lane against 2 ranged champions with cc.\n\n> Rengar especially, if you're knocked back by a Janna ult or Vayne Condemn, you're not reaching your target again, you wont be able to catch them.\n\nYes thats true, unless you get pushed back into a bush as rengar, you probably won't reach your target again. However you were in top lane 30 seconds ago, and now you're in bot, because for some reason you have the capability to leap on your opponent **as well as** cross the map faster than most other junglers. \n\nWhere as someone like anivia wont get pushed back by Vayne. One, because she can't dash in in the first place, and two, because she's still in river flapping her wings trying to actually get to the fight!\n\n> but have the draw back of slower movespeed to compensate.\n\nWhat exactly is Aurelion Sol compensating for? The fact that if you have a dash, he's fucked? The fact that if you have higher movement speed than him, he's fucked? The fact that if you have cc, he's fucked? Yes he has high damage and zone control, but he's hardly without heavy compromises already.\n\nAurelion Sol is the very definition of 'champs with a clearly defined weakness' \nNow try and tell me what Lee Sin's 'clearly defined weakness' is. If you can prove that it's an easier weakness to exploit and outplay than Aurelion Sol's then maybe ill accept you justifying him having more movement speed.\n\n_____________\n\nBut this isn't about giving slow people more movement speed, it's about asking why champions who are very strong in battle due to their combat mobility, also get great map pressure. While champs who's kits and play styles rely on map pressure, get shit all movement speed.","replies":[]}]}]}
