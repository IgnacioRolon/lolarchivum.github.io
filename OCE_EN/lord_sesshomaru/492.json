But when the enemy champion goes all in on you, they are RIGHT SMACK BANG on top of your model, so much so that you cant even aim a skill shot properly because it just goes right over them. \r\n\r\nWhy? Why are there different rules for unit collision?\r\n\r\nSurely if minions have an invisible forcefield around them, then you should too and Yasuo shouldn&#039;t be able to stand on your face while all your skillshots sail right over him. OR, If Lee Sin can dance a jig directly on your face, then shouldn&#039;t you be able to at least squeeze between two minions without being snared while your champion spazzes out for a few seconds?\r\nWhy have different rules for different things?\r\n\r\n\r\nClarity man...
