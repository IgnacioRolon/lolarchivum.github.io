So being able to enhance and live their narrative like this, is a really special thing. I love the colours too, everything just looks so tasty xD\n\nI have avoided playing Final Boss Veigar for the last several days to make it feel more special when playing on this map, and playing an Arcade skin just completes the effect! Very fun and enjoyable!\n\nWell done Riot, and thank you!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Pelican2013","date":"2017-08-11T01:47:01.933+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes","replies":[]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2017-08-12T08:04:41.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, but Star Guardians in my opinion have a better skin storyline, and bringing Urgot into the mix would be the finisher.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-12T09:21:00.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea the star Guardians are awesome!\nI bet you'll be looking forward to next patch then xD\n\nIt could just be me, but I kinda see the Star Guardians a little like the DC Lantern corps. \nLike cosmic cops almost, (except somewhat more adorable).\n\nAlthough perhaps it's just the colours and the flying xD","replies":[]}]}]}
