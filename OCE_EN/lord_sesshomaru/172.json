You just will not see how much of a shield you have... full stop.\n\nAnd that could be disastrous, jumping into battle, assuming you have a shield, when actually its gone but you just cant see the difference.\n(Clarity.)\n\nI played a training mode game, and gave myself max HP, so I had a 500ish magic shield on colour-blind mode, and it was practically invisible.\nThats a 500 damage shield that you have no idea is there.\n\nPlease. \nThere was nothing wrong with the deep purple it was before, it was easy to see on all kinds of HP bars, and purple is a much more &#039;magic&#039; colour than a lightly bleached shade of pink.\n\n\n_PS. why was it even changed? The patch notes gave no explanation._","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-03-22T01:42:20.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is morgana e and maw changed? or is it just to show other players that it is definitely Galio's passive and not an active effect from say a maw.
