Seeming winning is pretty much the whole point of the game anyway, so regardless of what your mission is, youre always going to be trying to win. \nSo rather than striving to complete an objective to gain rewards, you just play normally and rewards just pop up every now and then without you having to do anything. \n\nAlso the problem with having to win games for every mission, is that people can&#039;t play all day every day. \nSo if they only have time for 2 games, and they lose both of them, then they can&#039;t complete the daily missions, and it takes them so much longer to complete the other missions too. \n\nFor example last night my friend and I played for **3 hours** before getting our 10 tickets. And tbh we didn&#039;t even want to play anyway, seeming we were already having fun in a different game, but we only did to maximise our ticket gain. A lot of people don&#039;t have that kind of time, and so miss out on their missions.\n\nAlso, when a mission is &quot;Collect 200 CS&quot; Thats a personal thing that you have control over and can strive towards.\n&quot;Win with a Ziggs&quot; isn&#039;t. Not only do you have to wait around for there to actually be a Ziggs _(which are not common)_, but then you also have to win the game too. So you have very little control over completing your _personal_ missions.\n\nThis is a screenshot of one of my recent games. Myself and a friend were trying to get the _&quot;Win with Ziggs&quot;_ and _&quot;Win with Malz&quot;_ missions, neither of us play either champ _(but we were hardly going to sit and wait for both to just come along)_.\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/251105d157e7d0b193d1b05d001a5fce.png\n\nWe lost that game, _(not to be one of **those** guys, but I like to think that we did all we could)_. And so got 0 rewards.\nYou look at the scores and you think: We could not have tried any harder to win that, and still weren&#039;t able to.\n\nIt may be different for other people. \nBut It doesn&#039;t seem right _(for me at least)_ to have missions, that you just have no control over. Either you and your team do well and you win, or you don&#039;t and you lose. \nAll it is is a 50/50 chance of doing exactly what it is that you&#039;re supposed to be doing anyway. It&#039;s hardly a &#039;mission&#039;.\n\nLiterally every single mission in this event, requires you to win games.\nand it&#039;s fun of course, missions are always fun.\nBut its almost like there it&#039;s not even a mission, you just play normally like you would any other day, and occasionally you get an end-game popup saying _&quot;Yayyyyy you&#039;ve done something&quot;_.\n\nPersonally I&#039;m in favour of missions being a little more like you&#039;ve actually got to go and do something.\nIf youre really worried about them changing people&#039;s playstyle, maybe disable them in ranked or something? So people don&#039;t pick champs they wouldn&#039;t usually play.\n\nWhat do people think?\nDo you guys prefer win missions or objective missions?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-08-15T05:07:05.096+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really can't help but agree with this. With the Arcade event, missions have started to feel less personal and more \"grindy\", as well as feeling a bit too dependant on other players, when the assumption is that they're meant to be \"personal achievements\". Whenever I've seen a mission that is simply \"Win [X amount of] games\", I find myself doing it in Coop, just to get it out the way. At first, I started trying missions through ARURF, but have since reached a point where it just feels more rewarding to play much fewer Coop games, which doesn't seem like it's an intended result of the system.\n\nI suppose one thing to consider is that missions are still in relatively early stages, and Riot are probably just trying out some stuff to see what is and isn't successful. One change I'd like to see is more \"objective\" oriented missions, such as participating in destroying Towers and Inhibitors, and killing Epic Monsters (Dragon, Baron and Vilemaw), as well as changing \"kill/assist\" missions to be based on \"kill participation\" (making them more accessible to each role).","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-15T13:10:07.092+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does Coop vs ai count for wins? I thought they had wised up to that xD\nBut yea, it does feel like a cop out, probably not what they intended.\n\nI agree, more objective based ones would be great, not only is it something you can also try to do in a losing game, but it makes people more aware of the objectives as well. A double whammy.\nPerhaps even 'assassination' missions, like \"get takedowns on 10 mages\" or something like that. So you're specifically hunting something, and if it is a takedown, it can be kills or assists to cater to both assassin and support players.\n\nBut yea, it's just a grind atm.\nIt's a minimum of 19 wins to complete all the missions. _(52 if they didn't stack)_ + daily missions. Thats a hell of a lot of wins....\n\nIt's achievable certainly, but very hard for people who can only manage a game or two a day.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-08-15T13:27:00.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having played through the arcade missions on two accounts (well, mostly) I can confirm that the only thing that can't be done in Coop is the level 3 Blitz mission, specifically the part about \"winning 5 PvP games\". It honestly doesn't seem very good that it can be spammed like that in Coop, even with the one part holding me back from completion at the moment.\n\nIt would seem more reasonable for higher tier missions to be specific to PvP games, and maybe even not map restricted, so that it's not so much about just completing them, which is honestly the way it feels to me right now. Sure, you get the players who can't afford more than a few games in a day, so maybe what Riot should be looking at is a middle ground between \"grind-able in Coop\" and \"unachievable for less active players\".\n\nThe mission system certainly has a way to go before it will reach it's potential, so hopefully Riot will catch on to the things that are making it feel more like a grind than \"achievements\" within the next few iterations.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-15T22:54:07.543+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.\n\n'Achievements' is exactly right.

Though as i did say, some people might absolutely despise the assassin role and will get cancer from playing that role, which really pushes them out of comfort zones. As i said before, missions that are \"play with x class on your team\" might be more viable, as this allows people to finish missions without being forced into something they dont like.\n\nIf you have a support main, despises assassins (thus plays janna because support main who hates assassins), and only play ranked, it becomes unlikely that person will ever finish the mission. As such games that simply require your team to have x variable met are more viable and enjoyable for the whole family. \n\nBack to the \"Play x champ\", that might cause more problems in the fact mains could be denied their champions because everyone wants to play that champ to finish the mission. EG, the mission where you needed to play a game as kayn yourself was quite difficult for many as he was picked by someone else nearly every game, but if it is closer to \"Have a kayn on your team for 5 games\", its more plausible and likely to happen.  Think of it as a waterbed versus a spring bed, one is awkward and comes with many mixed reviews, the other is a solid statement anyone can be satisfied with (heh comfort zones... beds... im funny).\n\nYes mini wall of text\nTDLR; comfort zones.
