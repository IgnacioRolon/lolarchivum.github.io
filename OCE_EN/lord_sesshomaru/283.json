Neither Riot Games nor any of its employees and/or contractors accept or consider unsolicited ideas, original creative artwork or other works, including, without limitation, ideas or suggestions for new or improved games or technologies, game or product enhancements, marketing plans or names for new games (collectively &ldquo;Unsolicited Ideas&rdquo;). Please do not send your Unsolicited Ideas to Riot Games or its employees and/or contractors.&quot;_\n\nSo technically, according to their own terms of agreement all the pro &quot;creative community&quot; stuff is actually, for lack of a better word.. bollocks. It says in the terms specifically NOT to submit any creations. (unless obviously its an event like the x-mas fan-art/cosplay competitions.) \n\nThis means that if you have ever made a suggestion in game or on the boards/forums or shown Riot an idea for a skin or champ whether in writing or as an artwork (which is me too), they have a valid reason to terminate your account. (they&#039;re not going to of course, but legally you cant complain if they do) \n(although technically it says in the agreement that they reserve the right to terminate your account for any or no reason, so you cant complain anyway for any reason)\n\nSo the &#039;Player Creations&#039; Board, is kinda at odds with their own terms of use, its kinda like a trap... they encourage you to have your own creations, but say in the terms &#039;DO NOT SUBMIT ANY CREATIVE IDEAS&#039; \n\nit also specifically states that Riot employees do NOT accept or consider our creative ideas, (although it does state later on in the terms that if despite all this you do still submit artwork then Riot has complete legal right to use it without credit. Which implies that they do consider it.. which is contradictory to their own terms of use) \nDon&#039;t you just love wording. :P\nit also makes Void Fizz an interesting point of discussion...\n\nAnyway, Fun fact.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} \n\nPS. if i was Riot, i would consider an updated amendment to their terms and conditions to allow for their community friendly attitude (although me saying this has now violated my terms of agreement... again)\n\n(While nothing i have said here is false, this is partially a attention-troll post in the sense that obviously this is not how things are in reality the game, (we know that riot loves us and we love them) but at the same time its main purpose is a laugh at the fact that Riot is contractually bound not to look at our ideas, and that we breach our agreement by showing them)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-03-30T07:22:58.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well the difference in posting on the boards is that it starts a creative discussion in the community. The boards is for us not the Rioters, so submitting champ/skin concepts, game ideas etc to the boards we aren't forcing unsolicited ideas down their throats. But I certainly agree it could be worded better. That's mostly so people can't just go to support or pm rioters with ideas (they've got enough to deal with ey) for stuff like that.\n\nDoes that make sense? I think it makes sense.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-03-30T07:56:09.604+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say it's more likely to be there to avoid any kind of copyright infringement, either by mistake or by taking inspiration from original ideas on the forums. \n\n+ This quote tries to make that clear.\n\n _\"This policy is aimed at avoiding potential misunderstandings or disputes when Riot Gamesâ€™ products or services might seem similar to Unsolicited Ideas that are submitted.\"_\n\n They then go on to say that Riot is entitled to any ideas you do chose to submit and can take these as their own intellectual property... etc.\n\nYou're right in saying it's worded poorly though, there's a few possible loopholes around this. I assume they have some other end user agreements with revisions that cover them up.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-03-30T08:05:39.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True enough, there was that whole thing where people were claiming Kindred was a rip off of that yin yang fan concept champ which I forget the name of.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-03-30T07:37:34.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea that makes sense, but it still doesn't fix the 'Rioters don't accept it part'","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-03-30T06:14:36.025+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good find","replies":[]}]}
