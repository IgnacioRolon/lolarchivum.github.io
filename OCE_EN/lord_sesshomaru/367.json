Question.","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the new 10 bans coming out, the system has been changed so that banning is a simultaneous event, a free-for-all if you will. This is good for queue times, but means that you do have the possibility of choosing the same champion to ban as your opponent. Meaning you only get 9 (or less) champs banned instead of 10.\r\n\r\n- I personally don&#039;t like this, as it will make you feel really stink when you realise your ban was wasted. _(especially when there are champs that you HAVE to ban, becasue you cant afford for them not to be, so they will often be duplicated.)_\r\n\r\n**But my question is this:**\r\nHow will the duplicating of banned champs affect decision making when balancing from statistics?\r\n\r\nBy this, I mean, we already know how often champions are banned per game, and champions with high ban rates must at some point be looked at by Riot&#039;s balance team, _(because champions don&#039;t get banned that much unless theres something wrong with them)_. But what I want to know, is will duplicated bans be counted towards the overall &#039;ban rate&#039; statistic, meaning these champions essentially are recorded as getting banned by twice as many people, and thus be more likely to be considered for a nerf. Or will it just count as X champ getting banned &#039;per game&#039; meaning the ban rate statistic wont change at all\r\n\r\nJust wondering, because if the duplicate bans count towards the overall ban rate. then it will give us _(and more importantly, the balance team)_ a much better idea of just how many people are _not_ wanting this champ to be in their games. \r\nRather than the accuracy being 1 in 10, it&#039;ll become 1 in 5. Which is far more statistically accurate. \r\n\r\nSo, will duplicate bans be recorded as a statistic to be considered?","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-05-20T07:00:55.947+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hope this helps\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/soL9bXD.png","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-20T07:04:08.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you! that 100% answers the question! :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-05-20T01:12:34.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go back and read it.\n\nIt's changed for normals draft pick only, not solo, not duo, not flex.
