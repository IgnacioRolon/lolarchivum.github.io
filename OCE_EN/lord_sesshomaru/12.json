Whoever thought increasing it to 12% needs to be hung.\nIt could be easily balanced by being changed to physical or magic, or current health.\n\nRiot don't deliberately make a champion overpowered or underpowered, they want everything to be on equal play field, it's more healthy for your game that way, and the more champs that are popular the more skins you'll sell overall.\nThey are getting the hang of it, and have a much better grasp of the situation than other companies. (looking at you Valve)\nSelling skins is well your best way of making money for LoL, if the champion pool is stagnant then you aren't going to make anything, however if you make sure your game is well balanced that a large portion of your selection is being used you'll sell more skins.\n\nRyze is a great current example with his newest rework.\nHe's quite well balanced between skill and raw power. (though if you want to get the most out of him you're going to set your keyboard on fire due to the high speed friction)\nNew champs have also been quite underwhelming on release for sometime, I can't think of the last champ to come out that was considering OP on release.\nMight have been Vel'Koz or Yasuo, though I remember their launches being pretty meh.\nPeople thought Illaoi was broken on release, but two days later realised you just need to stand behind the creep and disengage when she uses her ult.\n\nBut you also have to take a look at the fact that not all heavily powerful/overpowered champs are popular, and it's basically because they are stale.\nTake Yorick and Urgot, pick them up and you'll win.\nUrgot got played in the championships last year, there were pros saying he's super strong. But his popularity didn't rise, despite the buffs he got that made him even stronger.\nYorick is incredibly strong at the moment, but no one notices him.\nHe has incredible sustain, damage resistance and consistent damage. Everything you want to win top lane in the past five years.\nBut no one is playing him.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-05T22:14:04.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still dont like her chase, unlike draven, its permanent and costs nothing, but i do agree, silver bolts are hopeless, you can build health, armour or magic resist, and either way you'll die just as quickly. (no wonder tanks are doing so much damage atm, theres no other way to play them) \n\nI agree with Ryze, they did a great job on him. Personally i like champions being underwhelming on release, Both Aurelion Sol and Taliyah (yes... even with the changes to her w...) are 2 of my 3 favourite champs, and I'm glad that no one plays them.\n\nYasuo has been fucked from day 1 and everyone (except Riot apparently) knows it.\n\nThe reason Urgot and Yorick are not popular even though they are strong is because the aren't impressive to play. Contrary to popular belief, it has nothing to do with how ugly they are (Jax is just as hideous and outdated and look at his popularity) They just dont have all the flashy mechanics of Zed and Lee Sin. People want to 'feel' skilled, so they play champs like Lee and Zed that make them look skilled while they actually aren't.\nUrgot and Yorick, just stand there and throw damage around you, its not that impressive to look at.","replies":[{"poster":"LÃ©gs","date":"2016-08-12T10:25:11.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you're being a bit too hard on assassin players in general.
