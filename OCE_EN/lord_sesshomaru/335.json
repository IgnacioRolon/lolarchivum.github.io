I don&#039;t mind waiting, and its not like its a first come first served basis... but like it gets to a point where you just gotta start getting creative, or else certain champs **just won&#039;t** get skins.\r\n\r\nI refuse to believe that in the 2 years since her inception, no one at Riot has come up with a single credible skin idea for Taliyah. And If that is the case, I would seriously be questioning the competence of your employees.\r\n\r\nSooooooo.. time to get creative guys!\r\n\r\nIt shouldn&#039;t be too hard, I mean, if Dark star Jarvan _&#039;fits the champ&#039;_ by your standards, then you could just slap any old skin on Taliyah and call it a match. So I really don&#039;t understand the holdup.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-12-06T23:49:46.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it worth giving a skin to Taliyah, considering how shit she is atm, maybe after they revert the nerfs that gutted her we might get a new skin","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-12-07T12:38:05.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't matter how popular/balanced a champ is, they still deserve skins though?\n\nAnd nothing stays the same in league for long anyway.
