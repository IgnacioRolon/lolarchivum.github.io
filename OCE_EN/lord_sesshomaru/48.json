The perfect skin for Kindred, lets get this one made!\r\n\r\nThe idea has been around for a while, but instead of Elderwood Kindred, they made Super Galaxy Kindred, which really doesn&#039;t fit her theme anywhere near as well as Elderwood. (don&#039;t get me wrong, super galaxy, is an awesome skin! its cool seeing a new sci-fi/Gurren lagaan take on kindred, and i cant wait for it!! but despite all its awesome aspects it still doesn&#039;t make as much sense as Elderwood.)\r\n\r\n(BTW I did not draw the picture, i wish i did, i wish i could, but i didn&#039;t. And i can&#039;t. I don&#039;t know who did. But they get full credit.) \r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?\r\n\r\nPS. Obviously i didn&#039;t come up with the idea, I&#039;m just giving it some more publicity, so it doesn&#039;t get forgotten.","replies":[{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2016-05-10T09:32:36.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd hardly call that an elephant in the room.\nand a better example of a perfectly fitting skin would've been surprise party fiddlesticks.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-05-10T10:29:19.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suppose it depends on what room you're in.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-05-10T10:41:58.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"An \"Elephant in the room\" for me, (not really thematically, but visually,) would be Bloodmoon Kindred, and Bloodmoon Jhin.
