(except that he doesn&#039;t need to break free because he could just go around the minion, but doesn&#039;t) also when minions are grouped up and i am in the middle and try to walk out, the champ will start to walk out and then change direction and then change direction again  (without me giving any extra commands) as if he cant decide on the best path, this never used to happen, it used to be that he would plough straight through them but just be slowed a little as he takes sudden 90 degree turns to get around them, but he could walk between minions, now i just cant seem to walk between minions, even if i click he will walk around both of them rather than walking in-between the two.\r\n\r\nand then today this happened which puts it to the limit, (refer to picture) i went to try help rengar, but i physically couldn&#039;t get in, i just watched yasuo walk up and down the line of minions tying to find an auto-path through them but he just wouldnt walk though them, and neither could rengar and rengar died because of it. I&#039;m not exaggerating, neither champ could get in or out and yasuo just wandered up and down the line but wouldn&#039;t go in. this just didn&#039;t happen before.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-11T14:36:48.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since the SR update, the minions are chunkier and cause a fair few problems, one i've noticed regularly is if a wave is big enough, minions will actually be forced to loop round the jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-07-12T12:14:42.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be funny to watch, how do you get that?
