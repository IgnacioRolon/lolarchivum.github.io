Anyway, the point was that Cosmic Reaver Kassadin was made to represent the OCE server. Bear Calvary Sejuani was made for Russia server. When they made the Caitlyn and Volibear skin they weren't \"representing\", just making a skin. You have made your point that you can grab any skin with a theme related to a country and turn it into a representation. Leprechaun Veigar is now representing the Irish! Awesome!
