He won't be viable if he falls behind in anyway. If yasuo falls behind, the only way to make a comeback on him is to farm, or get lucky and participate in a quadra-penta. also, because yasuo is practically a melee adc, he needs to be able to have high wave clear. If he didn't he would be like a bard trying to kill a minion with q, no better example, its like taking rockets from jinx. Yasuo isn't \"strong\" per se` he is just good for using to make plays with if you know what your doing, he is only \"strong\" in the hands of someone who knows what they are doing with him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-09-09T07:52:06.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I kinda like the idea but I don't really feel like he needs any nerfs.","replies":[]}]}
