The chroma packs alone cost 590 RP, if you already own the Champion, and will display that way. If you do not own the Champion, the bundle includes the cost for all items together Champion+Chroma Pack. For example: Caitlyn Rebel Chroma Pack will display as 1470 RP (880 RP for Caitlyn + 590 RP for the chroma pack)\n\nI hope that makes sense.\n\n-Riot Cochese","replies":[{"poster":"Suffocator","date":"2015-07-01T09:36:47.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I do own the champion though Cochese, \nI am trying to get chroma for my Yi but it is asking for 1565R  and I already own him. :s \nGaren is the only chroma pack I am seeing at 590 and it is strange as I also own Tristana and Yi.","replies":[{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2015-07-01T09:39:45.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Suffocator,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=9gpeIxv6,comment-id=0000000100000000,timestamp=2015-07-01T09:36:47.598+0000)\n>\n> Well I do own the champion though Cochese, \n> I am trying to get chroma for my Yi but it is asking for 1565R  and I already own him. :s \n> Garen is the only chroma pack I am seeing at 590 and it is strange as I also own Tristana and Yi.\n\nYou must not own the Yi skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Suffocator","date":"2015-07-01T16:14:44.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really don't see how I am meant to get \"590 If you already own the champion and skin\" from \"Champion base and skin chroma packs - 590 RP each\" :s.","replies":[{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2015-07-02T01:40:57.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Suffocator,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=9gpeIxv6,comment-id=000000010000000000000000,timestamp=2015-07-01T16:14:44.695+0000)\n>\n> I really don't see how I am meant to get \"590 If you already own the champion and skin\" from \"Champion base and skin chroma packs - 590 RP each\" :s.\n\nSome Chroma Packs are for champions, some are for a skin. So for Headhunter Master Yi and Rocket Girl Tristana Chroma pack, you must own the champion and the specific skin before you can buy the 3 recolours for that specific skin for 590RP.","replies":[{"poster":"Suffocator","date":"2015-07-02T05:00:27.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for clarifying, I would say they should reword it so it's less confusing, unfortunately I do not see it as worth paying 975 for a skin and then another 590 just for some recolours lol I really don't see the point. Maybe if every skin in the game could be chroma there would be a few that were worth it :s.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-07-01T04:12:30.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks so much for letting me know :) the Chroma packs look awesome especially Zac GJ guys","replies":[]}]}]}
