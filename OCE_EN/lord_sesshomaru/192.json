You do NOT camp your 11/2 Jax in top lane, you DO camp the enemy&#039;s 7/3 Miss Fortune. Now remember (and this is very very important) &quot;You guys fed her so theres no point camping.&quot; is not an appropriate response, and is actually counterintuitive. The trick is to camp the lanes that are struggling because they need your help, and you don&#039;t camp the lanes that are doing well because even though you could steal a few kills (and i know how tempting that is for you) they don&#039;t need your help and so its pointless to camp them at the expense of another lane.\n\nLesson 3: Ganking\nYou as a jungler are the &#039;engage&#039; of the team, it is important to know how long it takes for you to get from point A (the bush) to point B (the enemy champion) theres no use sitting in the mid lane bush, pinging and pinging your mid laner to go all-in on their lane opponent before you come out of the bush, because it takes less time for a Zed or Yasuo etc to kill your all-in mid laner than it does for you to get from the bush to their Zed. However, because your mid laner is a lot closer to the enemy than you are, it means that if you go in on the enemy champion first, they will be there to help you a lot faster than if you told them to go in first. \nMorale of the story: unless the situation is advantageous to the opposite, you as the jungler should be the one to initiate the engage.\n\nLesson 4: Ganking on low HP\nFirstly it is unadvisable to gank on low HP, but because you&#039;re lee-sin and you think you&#039;re indestructible, you do it anyway so here is a lesson to help with that. Just as important as it is to judge how long it takes you to to get from A to B it as also necessary to judge how fast your Laner can get from A to B, if you are low HP and you go all in on someone halfway down the lane, it is not your laner&#039;s fault that you just fed their lane, (and yes, even if you pinged them) so if you choose to take the risk and go in on low HP, make sure that your laner knows you&#039;re going in BEFORE HAND (thats very important, its no use pinging them while you&#039;re mid dash) and make sure that they are a distance away that means as soon as you reach the enemy its 1 2v1, instead of 2 1v1s. \n\nLesson 5: Reading the situation\nWhile it is important to gank, you also need to know when not to gank, your laner will know their own strength and the strength of their opponent better than you do, so if they show signs that they don&#039;t want to go in, then you need to respect that. These signs usually take the form of: hanging back at a safe distance, the little blue bar under their HP is low, a champion who relies on their ultimate doesn&#039;t have the little green dot on their portrait, etc etc.\nYour laner has been fighting their opponent for the last 15 minutes and if they are hesitant to go in even if you are ganking, its wise to think about why that might be the case and what repercussions might be, and not just go &quot;well fuck you I&#039;m going in anyway&quot; \n\nLesson 6: Its not always your fault, and how to deal with that.\nSometimes your laner will make a mistake, they might be so focused on last hitting that their awareness wasn&#039;t the best and they missed your engage and ruined your perfect gank, now even though that was their fault you don&#039;t need to explode at them, they already have the punishment of having their opponent fed further without you yelling insults at them. The best way to recover from a situation like this is to try your gank again and this time make sure that they are ready.\n\nLesson 7: Pinging\nPinging is a very useful tool that allows you to inform your laner that you are coming in for a gank, it also reduces the chance that they miss your engage like in lesson 6, so if you use the &quot;I&#039;m on my way&quot; ping before you gank, it puts them on alert and ready for action, if possible you should try to ping before every gank. Note: Pinging excessively at someone for any reason doesn&#039;t solve anything. Only simple direct pings help the team.\n\n(Telecasterdude has covered 8 and 9)\n\nLesson 10: Priority\nThe mid lane turret is ALWAYS (yes at any and all stages in the game) more important than wolves (i know its hard cos wolves are the most fucking important thing in your life right now but you need to go help the turret) so if theres an enemy attacking the turret and your laner isn't there, and you are attacking wolves or wraiths or blue or red, and you think to yourself \"ill go defend the turret as soon as I've killed this camp\" then you're doing it wrong. You go IMMEDIATELY and then go back afterwards to finish the camp.\n\nNow these lessons seem rather basic but i have seen that many many many junglers do not know them at all. so this is me sharing knowledge to the community for the benefit of all.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-12-20T22:45:51.153+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A few more from me:\n\n**Lesson 8**: Try not to gank on enemy power spikes (e.g level 6 Zed).  You'll just bait your ally into a bad situation most of the time, because he wont know or respect the power spike.\n\n**Lesson 9**: Counter ganks are so strong, master them, and you'll learn to dominate games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WhiteKimchi","date":"2015-12-21T12:04:25.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are going to be plenty of games where even if you are playing well, that one guy on your team who is 0/3 after 5min (usually top) is gonna start abusing you and blaming you for everything because no solo laner ever gets outplayed in solo q, if they lose it's always the jg fault.\nBasically as jg you cop the most shit if the team is losing even if you are doing ok.  Learn to block that shit out and focus on your own game try not to mute if you can cause communication is huge for jg but you can't let it tilt you or drop to their lvl or the game is basically over","replies":[{"poster":"drag66n","date":"2015-12-22T02:49:32.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"buy armor","replies":[]}]}]}
