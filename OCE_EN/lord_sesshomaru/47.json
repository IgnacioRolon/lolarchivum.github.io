The first pick of each team, nominates 3 champions (the teams can not see each-other&#039;s nominees) and if both teams nominate the same champion, then that champ is banned and both teams can still use their 3 bans on team-comp specific champs. (if 2 or more nominees are the same, then the system randomly selects one)\r\n\r\nthis way when WW has 70% win rates, no one has to waste a &#039;tactical&#039; ban just to get rid of him, and when the new champ comes out neither team has to sacrifice an actually useful ban just to make sure their team doesn&#039;t feed.\r\n\r\nAnd if none of the nominees match, then no champ is banned. \r\ni can see very few problems with this system.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-08-01T09:30:32.061+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"while we're at it, delete teemo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-08-01T14:41:24.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yi will be a mutual ban. It's always the garbage season 4 full crit Yi on your team, so better ban that away, and it's always the tank yet inexplicably hyper carry Yi on the enemy team. He is rare to see so he isn't a necessary ban, but if you don't have to waste an actual ban on him then it will be a no-brainer.\n\nHonestly right now Yi is a metaphor for everything wrong with league. He has too much survivability and tankiness, usually over 3000 HP with slows and 100 resistances, yet he deals absolutely retarded damage and can't be slowed. You can CC him, but he has tenacity and can dodge it with Q. He does max health, true damage, current health, physical, magical, etc. You can't build against him.\n\nNow whats similar is the problem with tanks. Their design is cool but they do so much damage without building damage. Illaoi can build full tank yet say goodbye to your team, Darius can dunk people from half health and kill, Mundo can out duel anyone and Garen is lowkey an assassin with 5000 HP.\n\nTheir base damages either need to be nerfed, or the tank items need to be nerfed. Tanks should be able to outduel people with no pen, but should not be able to literally ONE SHOT in terms of damage. I mean if you compared for example a full AP Fizz to a full tank Darius, the Darius could kill a stationary Sona faster. On top of that, he does true damage, so you can't build against him, and he can reset and kill your whole team.\n\nThat is why tanks are too strong. They are the only champions that can't be build against whilst been the living embodiment of building against.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Z3npachi","date":"2016-08-01T04:28:22.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well the draft phase is sort of supposed to work by, if you give up the 1 x S tier pick on the first, you should be picking up 2 x A tier picks for the opposite team. But having champion pools to facilitate the draft and people landing an order which can utilize it ( unless you can trade ) is a whole different thing. \n\nIt would reduce the \"give and take\" of the draft if the S tiers were simply removed from the draft because they were \"mutually\" agreed upon to being OP. Even then you are simply moving the S tier bracket down further and the next line of strong champions would be prioritised.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-01T09:17:54.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In an ideal world there isn't supposed to be S or A tier bans. You would only ban champions that directly counter your team-comp, so having these outlier champions like Hecarim is atm, wouldn't be an occurrence.","replies":[]}]}]}
