My Aurelion Sol one is still there, but i cant seem to create a new one. \r\n\r\nThis wasn&#039;t the case a month or so ago when I tried to make the Sol one. You could easily drag items across.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what I&#039;m doing wrong?\r\nIs there a bug? or am I just being me, and forgetting some basic step?\r\n\r\nthanks","replies":[]}
