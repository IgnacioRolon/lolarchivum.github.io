This is extremely frustrating, especially when trying to combo the W/E instead of E/W and makes her play-style very clunky. \r\n\r\nI want to be clear that her W is **not** a channel, you **can** move around while it is in its animation, therefore there is no reason why you shouldn&#039;t be able use abilities during its animation. \r\n\r\nPlease fix this, as it means that when you cast W, you cannot participate in the battle until it is complete (and by then its too late to cast E) \r\n\r\nA riot response would be nice, just to know if this is actually a bug, Thanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-05-31T11:46:25.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you see that section over to the left that says Report a Bug?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-05-31T11:50:11.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It'll get lost amongst thousands of americans moaning about one thing or another.
