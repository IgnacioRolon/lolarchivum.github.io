I doubt Riot would be compensating people for having their summoner name that's the same as a champion that's not yet been released/announced. If they do, however, they'd have to be doing it based on when the champion is announced (or even earlier, maybe) so people can't just use IP to name change to an announced champ and get free stuff when forced to name change.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-06-23T09:02:36.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But 13.somethingK IP for a name change only to be compensated MAYBE that new champ is not worthwhile, you lose more IP than it is worth.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-06-23T19:32:03.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends on the situation. If someone is cheap and doesn't want to spend RP (assuming the champ also came with the skin, or Riot was compensating with RP [or something else worth RP] instead) then it would very much be worthwhile as the player would effectively be getting RP for IP. Even so, a player may simply have no viable use for their IP (which is considerably unlikely at the moment with the addition of level 6-7 mastery and Mystery Champion tokens) and use the name change as an \"IP drain\".","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2016-06-23T08:39:53.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can have a skin name ie.
