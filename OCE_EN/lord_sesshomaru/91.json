(which you can only get by predicting every group and knockout stage match)\nit doesnt matter what anyone thinks if you dont watch their gameplay your guess is as good as anyones. preparation for the most important league event of the year means teams are probably gonna want consistency over anything else. in every match between a much better team and the other, the game gets out of control when the 1st mistake/s are made and its impossible to come back. to form any honest and genuine belief of an opinion of the potential outcomes you have to know a lot about every single player. so really the best thing to do is chuck the teams in the most likely outcome, watch worlds and heff fun","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-09-16T09:23:19.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bjergsen is always the right answer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Atlus","date":"2015-09-15T02:45:13.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is such a broad question!\n\n* EDG from china (formerly the best domestic team in China, now the most recent international Champions at MSI) are looking very strong, despite their second seed position.

I would say Marin can be more of a liability, sure he has great carry potential but often plays forward with no vision even when he has his trinket ward available to use. Does give up first blood often when it could've been avoided.\n\nEDG is looking good can't argue with that but I don't think they are looking as strong as they did at MSI.\n\nImp is looking like a boss again, his aggressive positioning on kog and his twitch play are lethal.\n\nHuni can come up huge for Fnatic I wonder if there strategy will be just to get farm on to rekkles(sp)\n\nDon't know too much about ahq west door is a tf freak tho.\n\nI think the key to winning worlds will once again be the synergy between jungle and support going on roams and getting key vision. I think KT have great synergy there despite getting 3-0 by SKT in champions final.\n\nI can't see any wildcard or NA teams making it out of pool play","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-09-15T03:22:12.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you so much, this is very helpful getting a base for everything (cos I'm pretty ignorant atm)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kimochi Senpai","date":"2015-09-15T02:11:17.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"- You can go to http://na.lolesports.com/news/power-rankings \nThese are the scores for each team internationally in the LCS\n\n- Previous winners who have made it into group stages this year are SKT and Fnatic\n\n- You can also go to http://na.lolesports.com/news or http://na.lolesports.com/news/the-breakdown\nThis is to view any news or information about teams and breakdowns of previous games\n\nHope this helped a little! :D","replies":[]}]}
