I think visuals are very important and that this is a great thing! :D\r\n\r\nHowever my question is about how you select the splash arts to update.\r\nI question the judgment of choosing for example jade dragon wuking  for updating over a skin that is really outdated for example phantom Karthus,\r\nWhile the new jade dragon wuking is really cool, tbh the skin did not need a new splash. There was nothing wrong with the old one, the model hadnt changed and the painting was of a higher standard than a lot of other skins. Where as phantom karthus has had an extreme mode change, (and now looks absolutely nothing like the splash art) and as well as that, the painting quality is not up to the same standard as the rest of the game. \r\nOf course the argument could be made that it is a legacy and so doesn&#039;t make you much profit and so it isn&#039;t worth updating (similar to not changing the magnificent twisted fate to reflect its price category) however grim reaper and statue of karthus both also have very very crudely painted splash arts, so why jade dragon over one of them?\r\n\r\nTL:DR: why pick a skin that doesn&#039;t need it like jade dragon wuking over a skin that desperately needs it phantom/grim reaper/statue of karthus?\r\nI&#039;m sure there is a reason, I would just like to know what it is, or how the selection process works. :)\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-10-14T03:09:15.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Our splash art team is ramping up to the long-term task of updating our older/less faithful skin splashes.
