There are 128 champions in the game, yet we only see 11 of them.\r\nIts unlikely that riot will lift a finger to help it (if they were going to then they wouldn&#039;t have let vayne have a 30%+ pick rate all season) they are just too scared of nerfing peoples favourite champs, and so sacrifice the quality of game to avoid a influx of &quot;wahhhh you nerfed my champ&quot; complaints.\r\nso im not asking them to help I&#039;m asking you guys what you think of it, are you as frustrated as me at seeing the same op champs again and again and again? Is a little variety too much to ask?\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-12-27T23:37:31.307+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This isn't Riot's fault at all though. Lee Sin, Yasuo, Thresh, Vayne, Tristana and Yasuo are all below 50% winrate, with others like Lucian, Zed and Jinx only just above 50%. Really the only OP picks on that list are Miss Fortune, Leona and Blitzcrank.\n\nRiot has literally no control over what people pick, and it would be stupid to unfairly nerf them just to bring down their play-rate. \n\n**Most of those champions are balanced** they might seem OP though because they are popular mains, so the people picking them are more experienced than usual on them. \n\nStill there is **no need to nerf.** In fact you should be glad, as you can statistically predict some of the teams champions before the game starts. This is great for bans and counter picks.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-12-28T00:11:27.004+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not unfair to nerf them, its tall poppy syndrome.\nif a blade of grass grows taller than the rest on your lawn you cut it down again, it doesn't matter if that blade of grass is a really healthy thick green blade (above 50%) or a really sickly yellow one (below 50%) you still cut it down to fit with all the rest.\n\nits got nothing to do with win rates anyway, its enjoyment of play. You said in Lemon and Carrot's post \"Brand and Illaoi are little shits, thank god their play rate is dropping.\" \nyour happiness at their pick rates dropping is proof that It doesn't matter as much that they are op if you don't see them as often, its only because you see them often and have to put up with them on a regular basis that makes you annoyed. Illaoi's win-rate is 47% wayyy under the norm yet you still hate playing against her. Im the same with Lee, sure he isn't a 100% sure to win champ, but because i have to play against him every day it makes him really annoying to fight. \n\nand no I'm not glad about the statistics for bans because wheres the variety? both teams spend the banning phase getting rid of 6 of them and then spend the picking phase trying to claim the other 5, you know the bans and picks before you even click the 'play' button. if i wanted such mindless repetition id play minesweeper or something, Hell! even chess starts a game with less certainty than lol atm.\nwhy play when you know everything thats going to happen?","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-12-28T01:12:11.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a terrible way to incite variety into a game. \n\n**Nerf champions so everyone is equally not fun to play?**\n\nWhat Riot has in place is fine, they are trying to rework other champions to improve their kit's relevancy and enjoyment.

Of course I want them to be nerfed, a low winrate is no excuse to keep a champion broken. I like the lower play rates because I don't have to deal with them as much, but if they just nerfed them to \"not OP\", It would fix the problem entirely. Also looks like the meta has grown to counter Illaoi while I was away which explains the lower winrate. She's probably bearable now.\n\nTL;DR\nBasically, this champion is too fun and too many people are enjoying it. Lets take that away. So flawed...","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-12-28T08:24:09.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Brand isn't OP, you can hardly call a champion who's entire burst potential as a MAGE depends on landing one of two hard to hit skillshots after you've activated the ability to proc their bonus effect (Q's stund or W's bonus damage).\nLikely you're only complaining about Brand because he's been played as a support a lot lately, that's no reason to complain about him being OP. Champions don't get balanced around their current and temporary position in the meta, they get balanced around their permanent overall effect on the game.\n\nIllaoi also isn't OP, she's actually quite underwhelming even if played well. She's strong in certain situations and only if she wins lane, but never OP.\nPeople keep complaining that her AD ratios are too high, yet they forget that as Illaoi you need to literally be in the middle of the enemy team in order to actually do anything, so if you build AD you will die instantly.\nKite around her and keep her at bay so she can't use her ult on more than two people at once and she's all too easy to take out of a fight.\nShe's a champion that punishes bad decision making and bad team play, but at the same time dies way too fast even if played right.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-12-28T22:18:53.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can say all you want about Brand, but with a winrate at 53.8% it raises some eyebrows.

No, but her winrate went back down anyways.\nWhy? Because people figured out what champs to play as support to counter Morgana support.\n\nHere's some things to remember.\nBrand is designed as a glass cannon mage, he's super squishy but does high damage.\nHis high damage is very reliant on his combo.\nHis stun needs to be comboed into play, as well as it being a very slow moving skillshot.\nHis W takes like a second and a half to burst up and do damage, it's very easy to doge if you don't have much movespeed.\nHis ult is quite useless if you spread out so it can't jump from unit to unit, meaning one person or minion will take damage once.\n\nHe'll likely see a lot less play after next patch since Frost Queens is getting nerfed to have it's original passive that stops the gold generation for 10 seconds if you kill a minion.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-12-29T06:41:28.481+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"_\"His W takes like a second and a half to burst up and do damage, it's very easy to doge if you don't have much movespeed.\"_\n\n**Lies!** I'll prove it to you mathematically.\n\nBlitzcrank was a champion I often picked to counter Brand the best I could. I always found the early game to be extremely difficult though. \n\n+ Blitzcrank has** 325** movement speed that's **325** in-game units per second. [Source](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Blitzcrank) and [Source](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Movement_speed)\n\n+ Pillar of Flame has a radius of **250** units. Meaning you need to move **250** units to dodge the ability. Also important to note that, Pillar of Flame will detonate in **0.625** seconds. [Source](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Brand)\n\n**250/325 = 0.76923 seconds**\nThat is the time it takes Blitzcrank to move **250** units. Essentially this is the amount of time it takes to dodge the ability.\n\n**0.76923 - 0.625 = 0.14423 seconds**\n\n**0.14423** That is the amount of reaction time you are given. Average human reaction time to a  visual stimulus is 0.25 seconds [Source](http://wiki.backyardbrains.com/Reaction_Time) \n\n+ Yeap, that's right. If you have the average human reaction time, it is legimately impossible to dodge Brand W. Even with 0 ping.\n \n Just to put it into perspective; if you had 40 ping (very good ping), you would still need a reaction speed of less than 0.1 second to dodge Brand W. Which incase you didn't know, a reaction speed of 0.1, is so fast, that it's considered a false start in the fucking Olympics.

He's also a mad money maker with his passive and Speltheif's. \n\nTo anyone wondering how they have dodged Brand W on 325 movement speed, it was because the enemy Brand made an error.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-12-28T01:57:44.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People don't play MF and because she's fun? they play her cos she's easy and powerful...\n\nshe has no fun mechanics at all her play style is literally just stand there and shoot at them.\nso people are not playing her for fun's sake.\n\nand your analogy of watering the grass is unsuitable, you try watering every single other blade of grass in a field except one, thats what riot did with the marksman changes and look how that backfired!\nimagine adjusting all the other champs abilities, and masteries and changing items in a way that makes all the other champs better to play but without making lee-sin grow in any way, thats just ridiculous, you cut down the tall grass because you cant make all the others grow up to the same length.\n\nand just like you want illaoi to be nerfed i want lee and vayne to be nerfed, i don't see that difference here? both are op Lee and vayne more so than illaoi even. The general populace only play champs because they are easy or op, so it stands to reason that champs that are played a lot are generally going to be OP. \n\n\nand the point is not to take fun away from those champs its too make them less powerful so less people play them and can try other champs out for a change. nerfing a champ doesn't make them any less fun it just makes them slightly harder to win with.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-12-28T22:12:08.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"MF is OP, her winrate is too high, and her OP-ness is the reason she is being played.

Sure there was some imbalance early on, but now we're almost at a point were each marksman is unique a powerful. **Graves** was the best rework of all time, **Quinn** is extremely unique now and **Corki** is a one of a kind ADC now with half AP damage.

Kog and Graves might be more interesting now, but they still arent picked anymore than before (graves is now picked less than he used to be before the update)","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-12-29T02:59:00.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope finally we can clear this up:\n\n+ Your **Rek'Sai** example isn't indicative of anything. Yes, **Lee Sin** does get more kills and dies less but what you fail to see is that these guys are not being built the same. \n\n **Lee Sin** is being built bruiser, if you look at [this](http://champion.gg/champion/LeeSin), the most popular build for **Lee Sin** has 3 damage items. Where as **Rek'Sai** is being built like a tank with all defensive items, link [here](http://champion.gg/champion/RekSai).\n\n And the champion stats support my claim, **Lee Sin** is getting more kills whereas Rek'Sai has higher than average assists and damage taken, reflecting his tankier build.\n\n This is why doing well is relative, **Rek'Sai** is doing a very good job from a supportive stand-point. He's tanking lots of damage, getting heaps of assists and sometimes giving up his life for the ADC. \n\n Infact I'd say **Rek'Sai** level 3 gank is more impactful than **Lee Sin**, because of **Rek'Sai**'s hard CC. **Lee Sin** is really just impactful with his damage, mobility, and sometimes good ultimates, not tanking or CC. This also explains why** Lee Sin** is picked more, **_because people like getting kills not assists._**\n\nFor this reason winrates are the only way to compare champions, champion kits differ too much to compare stats. _E.g **Teemo** might be winning more than someone else, due to increased vision with his mushrooms._\n\n+ Also, the reason for the marksman update wasn't to change pick rates, as I have said before Riot doesn't balance anything for pick rates, except extreme cases that require a rework (**Ryze**, **Sion**...) Here's the actual reason:\n \n _\"One of the most important goals of these marksman updates is to give each updated champion a unique reason to be brought to a game, and we want each champion to feel different whether playing against, as, or with.\"_\n\n No one should mind, if a majority of players like **Tristana**'s playstyle better than **Ashe**. As long as **Tristana** is being picked only for her playstyle, NOT BECAUSE SHE IS OP. Which I think is safe to say, is the case right now.\n\nTL;DR\nPeople like getting kills, **Tristana** is good at that. Simple. It's OK if some people like champions more than others, as long as that reason is not that they are OP.\n\nYou can't just nerf someone because the community finds them more fun to play than other champions.
