(and out of lane) \r\nand who should i pick against him?\r\n\r\nI dont know what to do, poke doesnt seem to work, because he just passively restores his health quite significantly, and he then can out poke you because his mana also is passively restored.\r\nYou cant go all in on him, his damage, CC and true damage ult just end you. And he&#039;s too tanky to burst down before he lands all his abilities. \r\nSo what should i do?\r\n\r\nObviously dodge his Q if you can (but it isn&#039;t the easiest thing to dodge if he aims it cleverly) and you cant dodge his silence (like literally even if you dash out of range, it still hits you if he cant it while you were in range, which is stupid) if his silence doesn&#039;t hit, its because he didn&#039;t use it right. You&#039;d think that once you avoided his abilities and got up close that you have the advantage, but his vorpal spikes do just as much damage as an AD champions basic attacks, plus he halves your health with his ult.\r\n\r\nSo what do i do and who should i pick?\r\n\r\nMy current main champion pool for mid is:\r\n\r\nAzir \r\nAurelion Sol\r\nKassadin\r\nSyndra\r\nKarthus\r\nVladimir\r\nAnivia\r\nXerath\r\nTwisted Fate\r\nYasuo \r\n\r\n(and even though i hate her i am thinking of learning Le&#039;Blanc because there are too many Ahri&#039;s and Fizz&#039;s around, and she counters them both, and none of my other champs counter either one.)\r\n\r\nAnd my main champion pool for top is:\r\n\r\nShen\r\nPoppy\r\nVladimir \r\nGangplank (although because no one else on the team ever picks a tank, i cant use GP as much as the other 3) \r\n\r\nSo please tell me if any of those champs are good against Cho in mid and in top. \r\nOr can you suggest champions that might have more of a chance against him? (maybe Swain/Morde? idk) \r\nIve been playing since season 2, so I&#039;m swallowing my pride by asking such a beginner question, but he has always given me greif, and its time i ended it.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated. \r\n(provided, &#039;just dodge it&#039; isn&#039;t the only advice you have to give)\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-05-06T02:13:10.586+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's pretty annoying to face him. if you're laning him and can't directly trade with him maybe start boots and take some potions for sustain so that you can last hit and farm minions while being able to dodge his knock up at least until either a jungler gank or you hit your own power spike at either a certain level or with a certain item. Maybe harass him when his knock up is down? Even if countered you can still outplay him. \n\n\nYou could also build items like hexdrinker if you're an AD mid or if you're AP abyssal scepter.  The new hextech item protobelt wouldn't be a bad choice either because it might help you dodge his knock up at some crucial points while granting HP and AP.\n\nThe primary weakness of Cho'gath is that he is like a walking mejai's since he loses his stacks. So dying as Chogath has  more consequences than  what i would with most champions. He doesn't have to necessarily die early. \n\nBesides if all else fails just try to keep yourself relevant without letting cho'gath outright snowball.
