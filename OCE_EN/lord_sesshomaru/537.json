It should be 40%.\r\nThis has happened every time I&#039;ve played him, the first 50 stacks always gives 10%, but after that that it doesn&#039;t seem to add up properly.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-10-14T10:02:58.643+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't state this, but it stacks multiplicatively (to be more \"fair\").","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-10-15T05:56:58.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhh ok thanks for that!\nThe wording should reflect that, to distinguish it from regular CDR.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-10-15T21:55:15.891+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think they have just gotten used to be allowed to word poorly and have the general public realize that and work around their shitty wording in a lot of cases to be quite honest with you.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-10-16T01:42:12.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I think you might be right.\n\nI once talked with a Rioter on a comment on the boards about how Zac's old ult was worded as a 'Knockup' when actually it was a 'knock back' _(which is a completely different result)_\n\nAnd paraphrasing here, the response was along the lines of \n_\"Ehhh oh well, they're close enough.\"_","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BloodyTompon","date":"2017-10-15T00:20:23.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's multiplicative not additive.
