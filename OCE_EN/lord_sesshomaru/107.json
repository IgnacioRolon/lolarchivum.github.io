You have to commit to both spells pretty much from the get go. So if you land them, it&#039;s devastating, and if you miss then it gives your opponent a window to capitalise on your error.\n\nWith her long sleep duration and her short cooldowns, casting her combos incorrectly doesn&#039;t seem to give enough of a window for her enemies to take advantage of as it perhaps should.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-12-06T03:31:48.106+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm not sure what you're trying to say the problem is?

But at the same time saying that the way it was meant to be would be too powerful. Meaning unless they just had no clue _(which is disconcerting)_, they knew the intended version was too powerful from the get go.\n\nPersonally I don't think any champ can be nerfed too much, better to have a bunch of weak champs to build up, than some absolute unstoppable menaces, that you either waste bans on, or just have no fun at all being steamrolled for 40 mins.\n\nLike Azir, riot knew theyd rework him, so instead of leaving him as a massive powerhouse permaban for a few months, they nerfed him into oblivion and sidelined him. Which worked well for everyone. No one got annoyed when playing against him, and it didnt affect Azir mains becasue they were going to play him no matter what. \n\nSoooooo much better than having him be a complete menace for months on end, annoying opponents by being too strong, and annoying Azir players by being banned all the time.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-12-06T12:41:35.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Live testing changes a lot, and so does time for the skill curve to adjust. It's entirely possible what they thought would be a good range for it on release turned out to be too strong after a couple weeks play. Fixing the bug made that range more reliable, but it was strong with the bug, so I imagine they wanted to try and balance out the power shift.\n\nRemember that balance is something that essentially changes over time played on a champion. Someone who has never played Azir before is probably going to feel like he is the weakest champion ever, but in experienced hands he can be strong to the point of overbearing. It is also very dependent on player skill, especially when it comes to champs like Zoe that are mechanically intensive. When a new champion releases it applies to the whole playerbase, and not only is it learning how to play her that is a factor, but also learning how to play against her. The first few weeks of a champions release see a big change in that champions balance for a lot of reasons.\n\nI would have though you of all people would be against nerfing champions into the ground and then building them back up given your love of Azir. It's why they only use it as a last resort tactic, because it really hurts the people who love that champion and are stuck with a disadvantage. If they did that to every champion who got strong in a given patch then it'd be done to every champion, at which point you'd be back at square one, just with longer and less fun games cause everyone does less of their thing overall.\n\nI really don't think Zoe is all that overpowered. I agree that she is a little too strong (or was, only played her once on the new patch so can't comment on how much has changed) but not truly OP, and not nearly as frustrating to play against as something like Katarina.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-12-06T13:12:43.744+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that champions feel and play different depending on how used you are to them. \n\nBut after spending all this time designing a champion, and testing both within riot HQ and on PBE, one would assume that they would have a fairly clear understanding of the champion's potential.\nObviously the sheer numbers in live server release brings up lots of missed bugs and other avenues of misdirection. But you still have a decent idea of how it will react with the game. \n\nE.g. if you've got a fast moving, hard hitting CC particle, that also has a long range, you have a pretty good idea that its not going to be the weakest spell in the game.\n\nI mean don't get me wrong, I'm loving Zoe!  and I personally don't have a problem with the range, its the duration that worries me, and thats what they just buffed..\n\n__________\n\nNah I much prefer taking a champion down a few pegs and thing bringing them back up little by little, than keeping them an absolute monster until you can be bothered dealing with them.\n\nI preferred Azir weak, I hope they nerf him _(and Sol, and Taliyah)_, not only does it add more skill into the game, _(which in turn makes you feel better when you actually accomplish something)_, but it lengthens fights and duels, so its not just: 'whoever can dump their kit out the fastest wins' which is basically the current meta.\n\nAnd nerfs don't really affect people that heavily who main that champ.\nif you use and practice a champ every day, youre always going to be decent with them regardless of how strong they are in the overall meta, _(hell i had a 70% win rate on Azir at his weakest point)_, so nerfs only really affect the people who are like _\"ohhh Azir is strong this month, lets play that!\"_\n\n> just with longer and less fun games cause everyone does less of their thing overall.\n\nI disagree with this, longer games are almost always fun, if a game actually extends out past 40 mins, its usually because is a very even game, and who doesn't like a fair fight? as opposed to being completely curb-stomped in 20 mins by a wall of juggernaut/assasins that you cant do anything against.\n\nand they wouldn't be doing 'less' of their things, they'd be doing more, more time to use abilities and stretch out the fight that little bit longer so you can get another dash or stun in there. It adds more room for outplay and strategy.  It's always more satisfying when your long term plan comes to fruition. Its why lots of people like playing Riven, you get to use pretty much everything in your kit at least twice _(maybe 3 times)_ before the end of the fight. Then you get champs like Xerath who throw out a couple of spells and then go make coffee, and not surprisingly less people play him.\n\nThe current meta is just boring, you point and click and dump as much of your kit on them as possible and see who 1-hits each other first.\n\nI think there needs to be a 15-20% damage reduction across the board, so sustained damage champs live long enough to actually qualify as 'sustained'. Tanks shouldn't die as quick as they do, tanks shouldn't even really do much damage at all _(let alone have as much as Vi or Illaoi)_ and be able to take more hits instead. Assassins should have to use their **entire** kit on a champ in order to 100-0 them. etc. instead of absolutely raping one person and then still have enough combo left to cripple or kill the person standing next to them too.\n\nSo yes, im a fan of nerfing champs into the ground, the problem is that Riot have this annoying habit of building them back up again... -_-\n\n\n____________\n\nI agree, I don't think Zoe qualifies as overpowered, I think she could have less leniency on how much time she has to act on her E, but that about it. She is far from the infuriating play style of Kat. \n\nKat is hard to play you have to give her credit for that, but there is so much hidden power in her kit, _(e.g. not being able to right click on her with AA champs.)_ which isnt an intended function of her kit, but a byproduct of her ability to dodge skillshots. and you cant really nerf it without removing the thing that makes her Kat. which makes her very infuriating.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-12-06T14:02:56.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean I think we'll have to agree to disagree on that one, while I hate flavour of the month champs like Kat that are just cheeeeeeeeeeeese for days removing that much power across the board is not something I'd be too happy about. I enjoy longer games contrary to most people, but when fights drag out too long it's just not as satisfying.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I don't think any champion, no matter how fed, should be able to kill any other champion, no matter how underfed in &lt;1 second and be able to reliably get away. If you're doing that, you should be dying for it unless they're on their own, and that just isn't the case with champs like Kat.\n\nI don't think making everything take longer is the way to go though, but to each their own right? People enjoy different parts of the game. I love support in Overwatch cause I can see the whole picture, while others play Widow cause they like getting picks and so on and so forth.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-12-07T00:07:24.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.\nPerhaps a flat out damage reduction isnt the way, but still, something has to be done about the excess of damage in league atm.\ndying in under 1 second has long since become the norm when facing most champs, _(even Vi a fricken tank/fighter can kill you in under that amount of time.)_.\n\nI think champions like Kat _(and Zed and similar ones)_, should have to choose between a guaranteed kill, or an escape, they shouldn't have both. Ekko is a good example of this, his ult can be either a huge damage nuke which pretty much guarantees the death of his target. But if he uses it to kill the target, he is left in the fight defenceless without a means of escape. _(talking about actual assassin Ekko here, not the frustrating unkillable tank one.)_\n\nwhere champs like Zed and Kat compromise absolutely no damage at all to make their escape _(their escapes don't even cost mana.)_ At least champs like Kass, Ekko, LB, Talon, etc have to choose between extra damage, or escape. Which is how an assassin should be in my mind. \n\nAnd if a champ does have reliable access to escapes such as Riven or Yasuo, then they shouldn't have enough damage to instantly assassinate an opponent.\n\nI agree that everyone is looking for something different in the game, but if you are just wanting a fast-paced game where you stack up kills, then play aram or TT. Otherwise, if you make summoners rift all fast paced and kill-focused, there is no game mode left for those who enjoy the strategy and outplay of longer games.\n\nAs it stands, champs like Ashe who need time in a fight to build up her Q stacks, never last long enough to actually get going, _(unless the enemy has horrible focus)_, and it's not even the assassin who takes her out, all it takes is to be ulted by a Vi or Shyv, and thats Ashe gone instantly. The same for other champs who need time to get the ball rolling in fights, they fall by the wayside in favour of champs like Zed or Kayn who can dump their whole kit on someone in 0.3 seconds and then thats job done.\n\nBut of course this could all just be me...\nI like champs like Azir/Sol/Taliyah and now Zoe, _because_ they require some degree of setup and prior planning. They aren't just _\"I see an opening! I'm going in!\"_ type champs, there is some brainpower needed to succeed. But I seem to be in the very small minority when it comes to this preference.\n\nIt's one of the reasons I really enjoy playing a Tank or Healer in Elder Scrolls online, _(don't get me wrong, I always have a special place in my heart for Telvanni mages)_ but as a healer/tank you're alive long enough to work out a plan of attack and affect the fight for longer.

I was admittedly a little sarcastic but I was unsure if you were exaggerating or misinterpreting and you were not exactly crystal clear so I did the best I could with the information you gave me, which was that Zoe could kill a tank with 3k health + MR + Armour in one combo and that she did 700 damage with one ability/auto (still unclear on which btw).\n\nAs to your points, I agreed that visual clarity could be an issue and should be looked into, it's the kind of ability you need to be able to see. I also pointed out that because it does *up to* double damage and not just double damage, there are significant limiters on the damage she can do. At most her Q is going to do 1.5~x damage on a slept target, and that's only if noone else breaks the sleep first.\n\nIt is long, but it is also not set like say, a Morgana Q or Ashe arrow is. Being delayed it is also *much* weaker against mobility targets, for example Kha'zix who can just jump away before he is slept. It also has all the same counters as any other game changing CC.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2017-12-06T04:19:47.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yasei Doubutsu,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=xLGGigTh,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-12-06T03:48:04.059+0000)\n>\n> The problem is she can one shot tanks or anyone if she lands that stupid fucking bubble.\n> \n> The problem is a ball coming out of nowhere hard to see, thus hard to dodge.\n> \n> That the CC is one of the longest lasting CC in the game, which gives Zoe plenty of time to one shit a 3K HP tank with armor and MR.\n> \n> THATS the problem.
