They won in the end and we went back into queue, and got matched with the exact same team, we laughed about it and it was almost like our two clubs were rivals. we won the second one)\r\n\r\nAnyway, thats all well and good, the problem i have with it is that when you select your club tag, if you put in a name that has already been taken, it notifies you that you cant use that name. However if you put in a name that hasn&#039;t been taken, BAM! thats instantly your new club tag, that you cant change.\r\nIf the system revolves around having a unique name, then its only natural that all the good ones will be taken early on and only the average or clever ones are left, this means that your 1st choice of name (and 2nd 3rd 4th 5th etc etc) are probably taken already, so you will naturally be trying to find a name that isn&#039;t taken that you and your club members like. \r\nThis is very difficult when the first name you put in that isn&#039;t already taken, suddenly becomes your tag without even a warning. \r\n\r\nSo i ask Riot, what are the possibilities of adding a &#039;tag change&#039; feature, and/or more importantly having a &#039;check availability&#039; feature (like when you change your summoner name) when you make your club. \r\n\r\nIt just doesn&#039;t seem awfully fair that you and your friends are stuck with this club tag forever, when you couldn&#039;t even check to see what other names might have been available. \r\n\r\nthank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-06-24T00:03:31.653+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I brought this up a while back, but I'm not sure on the current progress or if it's even something they're working on.
