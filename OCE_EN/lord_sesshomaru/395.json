Plus when you die randomly after leaving a fight and have no idea what killed you, its nice to get a bit of clarity. But you cant do any of those things in its current state.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-05-10T08:26:43.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least it doesn't show you playing Lucian and doing 5% true damage to yourself with an auto attack...
