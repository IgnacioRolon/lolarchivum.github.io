To counter her true damage get  {{item:3110}} {{item:3143}} for the attack speed slow or choose champions like {{champion:20}} {{champion:54}} who both have attack speed slows.Also one thing you may not notice about vayne is that she deals more physical damage than true damage and she actually need a {{item:3035}} to deal with tanks but to a lesser extend. To counter her stealth just get a {{item:2043}} {{item:3362}} . Her tumble isn't a very high range dash and only dashes for like 300 unit which is really not a lot. All the adc you mention that have a dash can dash through walls but vayne's tumble cannot go through walls except some very very thin ones and its not easy to tumble through even the thinnest wall in the game as vayne. She also have terrible laning phase and extremely bad wave clear and she have no aoe spells and all her skills are short ranged which is why she need a short CD dash to make up for her lack of range on her skills and auto attacks. Lucian's dash may have a 14s CD but actually thats a lie because your Q, your W and even your ult will reduce the cooldown of it meaning it is actually on a very short CD just like vayne's Q. Lucian just like Vayne is short range and he have a low CD dash. Do you see the similarities ? One last thing that i want to say is that why not just ban her in ranked if you don't want to deal with her ....\n\nTLDR : Vayne not Op and have counters.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-07-16T05:08:58.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vayne currently has a 51% winrate and its falling HARD! - last week she had a 54.6% winrate.

She is by far, no means broken, in fact il'd prefer versing a vayne due to her short range and weak laning stage giving your team a huge advantage to make plays in the early stages of the game, yes if she wins laning she can be a pest, but against current mid laners like viktor, azir or high burst champions she has no range at all to survive against them unless mechanically good enough to dodge all their abilities.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Preminition","date":"2015-07-16T02:32:00.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every adc plays differently, otherwise it would be boring. Without a doubt vayne has the weakest early game of any adc. short range, 0 AOE abilities meaning slow clear times, and because of her core item build that eventually makes her strong in the mid/late, she has a pretty weak build path until you finish Bork. Vaynes all about making it too mid game unscathed so that she can start too snowball from there while other adc's can put on the pressure very early. \n\nIf your losing lane to a vayne it's probably because of the support she has with her. \n\nAnd just with the dash cd times uve listed. Both graves and lucian can lower the cd of there dashes to less than vaynes (i believe graves is the most mobile adc when it comes down to it).\n\nDraven has the most dmg early and can easily push vayne out of the lane to shut her down early. \n\nOn top of all that vayne relies heavily on auto attacks, unlike champs like lucian. Played a game the other day where they had a nasus and a malphite, both with frozen hearts. Wither + ground slam + frozen heart meant i just got shut down, not really anything i could do about it. Im only in gold, so can't really speak for the higher tiers of players, but currently at this rating, while it does somewhat rely on the enemy comp, it's not that hard to shut down a vayne early and build against her so that she can't just tear through everyone. Exhuasting a vayne means 0 dmg from her for the next 3 seconds.\n\nPS. With runglaive and devourer assassins are definetly starting to come back to the jungle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"vicelore","date":"2015-07-16T01:44:05.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sweet, Gonna start playing Vayne !!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-07-16T02:31:50.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good luck, you'll be fighting 35% of the population to get her first","replies":[]}]}]}
