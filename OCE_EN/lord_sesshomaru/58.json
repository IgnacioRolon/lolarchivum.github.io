(if you're a PC nut, you might not like this)","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Every time I look at the boards there is always at least 1 post about racism and how bad it is and basically ends up as &quot;Riot ban X person he hurt my feelings!&quot; Now Racism is completely unacceptable in my opinion! But what exactly is racism?\r\n\r\nRacism is: The belief that one race is Superior or Inferior to another.\r\n\r\nNow i am pretty sure that **very very very very** few people still _genuinely_ believe that white people are a superior species to black people etc. Thats Nazi level shit right there, and I&#039;m fairly sure that when you&#039;re complaining about &#039;Racism&#039; in league, it isn&#039;t as serious as that. \r\n\r\nThere is a distinct difference between racism and stereotyping. Racism is meant as actual hate, where stereotypes are exaggerated representations of the perception of a group of people (and are largely meant as comical) and are based (like all myths and legends) on a grain of truth. There is a big difference there.\r\n\r\nFor example saying &quot;A Maori stole my TV&quot; is a stereotype (albeit a not very nice one), but its not racism, and heres why: \r\n\r\nIn that statement, you are not inferring that Maori people are superior or inferior to you. You are making an exaggerated perception based on a grain of truth, the grain of truth in this case is that a large portion of theft and crime in parts of NZ are performed by Maori people. Thats the truth (a sad truth, but a truth none the less), its not racist to say that because its statistically the truth. It is due to social situations in the country (and is due in no small part actually to white people) and is not a genetic trait of Maori people obviously. But its the truth, and any stereotype about that is not hate speech nor believing that one race is superior or inferior. \r\n\r\nIt is no different to the stereotype about Aussies or Kiwis, Aussies are known for being Crocodile-Dundee people who live in the desert and spend their time getting drunk and throwing babies to Dingo&#039;s. Obviously thats not how all Aussies are, just like how not all Maori people are impoverished, but there is a lot of drinking that happens in Australia, and some people do live in the outback and wear a leather hat with crocodile teeth (hell I&#039;m a Kiwi and i own a hat with crocodile teeth). Its not Racist, there is a truth in there, and people expand on it for comedic reasons. In NZ we are known for being Sheep shaggers, and walking around in gumboots everywhere. Which also has a grain of truth we are outnumbered by sheep 10 to 1 here and the people who look after the sheep do indeed dress like Fred Dagg and wear gumboots. \r\n\r\nSaying &quot;he&#039;s good at lol he must be asian&quot; isn&#039;t racist. Its a stereotype based on the fact that in Asia there is a lot of pressure from parents for their kids to work hard and excel in their studies, and that way of thinking ends up being transferred into everything they do (even if its playing lol) and you cant argue with it, all the pro teams are Asian, the best players in the world are Asian. Obviously not all Korean people are genus&#039; or Lol wizards, but that is the stereotype we have. its not **hate**, and so isn&#039;t racist. \r\n\r\nSo next time you come complaining to the boards, sit back and have a good solid think about what was actually said. If they truly assaulted you and it was clear that they genuinely thought that they were better than you because you were a different race, and that you were a second class citizen. Then yes feel free to post about it and report them. But if they made a remark in anger that was based on a stereotype, then you have to think to yourself: &quot;a=Are they actually truly racist? Do they actually walk around and feel the need to throw stones at people with darker skin? OR are they just mad cos i ran into a 1v5 and died, and said something non PC in the heat of the moment?&quot;\r\n\r\nRacism should never be tolerated, its abhorrent, but getting your knickers in a twist over some harmless remark is stupid. Have a bit of a thick skin, Report actual genuine Hate, but think about what the definition of &#039;Racism&#039; actually is, there are very few proper racist people around these days. \r\n\r\nFood for thought.","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2016-05-31T23:36:22.554+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Except racism isn't just beleiving your race is superior. \n\n\"Racism is a product of the complex interaction in a given society of a race-based worldview with prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination. Racism can be present in social actions, practices, or political systems (e.g., apartheid) that support the expression of prejudice or aversion in discriminatory practices.\"\n\nYou might feel those stereotypes or jokes are not racist and harmless but you don't get to tell someone what you said isn't offensive. You can have light hearted banter without bringing race into it. And the majority of race related comments I have seen on league are definitely not light hearted banter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-05-31T11:44:46.911+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you.\n\nI recently got chat banned and permanently hextech crafting banned for calling someone on the enemy a certain term which I will not say again, even though me and him were joking around the whole game.\n\nAnd he didn't report me, or even if he did, I got instantly restricted by a robot because it sensed that word. It's not like they needed to check the context or anything, just make a robot do it!\n\nAnyway, my point is I wasn't stereotyping dark skinned people, nor distancing them, nor insulting them, nor been racist. What I don't understand is they don't want to be associated with this word in fear of racism, yet when I use it out of context to a WHITE person as a joke, people go haywire.\n\nI'm actually in disbelief at how butt-hurt a robot can be today. Maybe if the player wasn't joking around, it was serious, he was black, and I was been racist I could accept the punishment, but not this shit.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-05-31T12:20:24.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That really sucks man :/\n\nnot fair at all!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SirArcticWarfare","date":"2016-05-31T12:01:10.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"persay i was black. and i dropped the Bigg N. would i be banned ? since its a word Thrown around more than a 4 year old in a gorilla enclosure ?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-05-31T12:19:59.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I cant say if you'd be banned or not, but i believe you shouldn't be banned.
