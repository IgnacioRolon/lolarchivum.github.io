JOKES! UNDO!&quot;_\n\nIt&#039;s his bad play if he dives you while you have a contingency plan to deal with him.\nWhy should he be able to to so easily waste your cooldowns when he was the one who made the bad play?\n\nAlso its not like you have a choice either, if you have 1 hp and he is diving you, you don&#039;t have the luxury of not using your spells.\nBecause if you don&#039;t, you WILL die, its a win/win for him no matter what you do.\nEither he gets a kill and escapes tower with W, or he stops his Q with W and you get a huge cool down penalty on your spells, without affecting him at all.\n\nAnd why is this exclusive to Lee? Other champs with multiple dashes cant stop their dash _(Fizz cant use his Q while his E is in effect, LB cant use her Ult while her W is in animation, Talon cant use his Q while mid-jump over a wall, even Riven cant stop her shield dash with a Q)_. Why should the physics of the game be any different for Lee?\n\nIf you&#039;ve used a spell, you should have to be committed to it. \nImagine if TF or Kench could just cancel their ult whenever they used it in a bad spot?\nor if Caitlin could stop her ult from firing if she saw someone walk in front of it?\nIt&#039;s just not right, so why does Lee get that option?\nLike every other champ, he should have to assess the situation and then act, and he has to suffer the consequences of that action _(wether its a nice kill, or a nasty piece of CC under the turret)_.\n\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-04-19T13:36:12.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only way to outplay a Lee Sin is for him to be outplayed by his own bad-ness.

As much as I hate champions like Yasuo or Xin for being really annoying, Lee Sin takes the cake.\n\nHe's a champion that if even a little bit ahead has the tankiness to survive any smart fight, and the damage to solo carry it. \n\nHe has the means for assassination, engage/disengage, utility fighting, tank fighting and zone fighting.\n\nHe has the mobility to screw over most mages or caster ADCs completely and the damage/sustain/resistance to screw over every other squishy (the targets that would ideally be able to outplay him since they would be his desired targets).\n\nHe out assassins even those assassins that build glass cannon.\n\nHis ult which is a LONG knockup and displacement is also AoE and does insane damage on top of his already damage heavy kit.\n\nAll of his spells have utility on top of the damage heavy kit.\n\nNot to mention that the toxic tryhard Lee Sin's seem to be pretty much the most toxic people in the game, because they are a god and you are beneath them if they are winning even a little bit (regardless of whose team you are on) and if they are losing then they are still a god but you are just so bad at the game that you've dragged them down.\n\nOh and the fact that Lee Sin gets a legendary skin that says \"hmph, too easy\" when he gets a kill.

I'll try and argue against you (or for you, I myself am not quite sure yet were I stand while writing this lol), but you make a fair point that other champions can't use other abilities while in dash.\n\nFirst of all, as someone with 90 000 points on lee, I can tell you this is incredibly hard to do, and even the best lee sin mains say that it's near impossible unless you have a stable ping and a lot of experience. Ok, maybe I exaggerated, it's not that hard, but what is hard is trying to place a ward mid air AND jump to it, which sorta leads me onto my next point.\n\nThis is one of those mechanics which defines lee sin, and makes him so fun to play. One of the most famous and trickiest lee mechanics is too use your q to dash to a champion, but mid-air ward hop behind another champion and kick them. The removal of this would still technically make these kind of plays possible, but they would be a lot slower and a hell of a lot easier to make, which detracts from lee sin as a champion. So in response to your original question, yes, he does need this mechanic otherwise it minimalises the already small amount of options and plays he can make in teamfights.\n\nHowever, I do agree with you that if lee sin can cancel his dash with an ability, so should other champions. There is nothing in his kit or ability descriptions which specifically states that his Q can be cancelled or that his W cancels other abilities, so if this is a mechanic for lee, so it should be for other champions as well.\n\nI think Riot should just nerf Lee. Sometimes I'm playing him and I suddenly do an obscene amount of damage, and I can't help but think how pissed off the guy who I just slaughtered must be. The one thing Riot definetly should not do is change his kit. I'm sorry, but you can't help but deny that a lot of players consider him the most fun champion in the game, so changing his kit would be one of the worst decisions Riot could make.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-20T02:21:49.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can I just say, that it is very refreshing seeng someone talk objectively about their champion.\nIt makes for great discussion!\n\nYou make an interesting point that it defines a lot of Lee's Plays.\nWhile it is too strong when it comes to the situation I mentioned, it might well be essential to do some of the neat insec plays that he is known for. Which could pose a problem if it was removed.\n\nMy compromise would be that you can still place wards while jumping _(there are very few abilities (if any?) that you cant place wards during.)_\nAnd that way, you can Q to the target, place a ward while in mid air, finish your Q, and as your Q finishes and does the damage, you can jump back to the ward.\n\nThen the clarity would be better. When Lee flies through the Air, you're supposed to know which target he is flying to _(shown by the blue circle thing)_, but if he randomly changes direction while in mid air and ults someone else, then it isn't very clear for the players playing against him. And that is ultimately what Riot is trying to avoid.\nIts like when you see Zac slingshotting himself, as soon as you see it, you can place your Cait trap on his landing zone, and outplay him. Itd be hardly fair if Zac could just cancel his dash if he sees he might be in trouble when he lands. He should have had to make that decision before he jumped.\nIt might rob him of one or two plays, but i think that once Lee's Q is started, he should have to finish it. Like all other champions.\n\nIt is my opinion like you though, that things should be standardised, so if Lee can change direction, then so should other champions.\nHowever while its not tooo bad on Lee, the same might not be true of others, imagine a Fizz Q'ing while mid hop.... \nSo if we make all champions able to change direction, i think it could lead to some huge balance problems.\nWhich means we either need to break the rule and let lee change direction, or make it so he has to follow the rules as well.\n\nI also agree with you that his kit in general shouldn't be changed, people do find it fun, and they love imitating plays made buy the pros. Taking that away just for the sake of a few number tweaks would be a tragedy.\n\nI think that nerfing a few numbers would be the best approach. Give his 2nd Q and R less of a AD scaling, so that he has to decide between tankiness OR damage, he cant have both.\n\nHe is so fun, and that is partly the problem, if a champion is so popular, you have to deal with their shit again and again every game, and most people lose patience when this 3000+ HP tank comes flying towards you and half healths your entire team with his ult. So for the sake of the sanity of the player base, he does need to be taken down a peg somehow.\n\nBut i definitely agree, Riot current way of balancing champs is just to re-work them and re-work them until they are balanced, and I think changing Lee's Kit too much, would be a terrible mistake. Many players like yourself might not like the 'new' Lee, and that would be terrible for someone who loves him so much. _(I will have to face this when they re-work Aurelion Sol D':)_\n\n_________\n\non a different note, I would like your opinion on this:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0Nrz4fekIU\n\nBard clearly flashes at the exact right time to get away, the damage was already dealt to him, but Lee teleports to him again.\nWhat are your thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2017-04-20T12:42:03.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll admit I saw this like 5 hours ago, and wanted to make a detailed reply but saw Xayah had been released and just had to play her :/\n\n> Can I just say, that it is very refreshing seeng someone talk objectively about their champion.

So, I always try and talk about my mains as honestly as I can without being biest.\n\n> My compromise would be that you can still place wards while jumping\n\nThis would definetly be my solution to the situation, that way we can still pull off the play I referred too, but can't do the obnoxious one were we make you waste your flash (it's still funny as heck for us though lol)\n\n> However while its not tooo bad on Lee, the same might not be true of others, imagine a Fizz Q'ing while mid hop....\n\nYeah, this is probably why standardising it on some other champions would just be... eugh\n\nI mean could you imagine if Fizz could proc all of his Ult + Q + E + Thunderlords damage at the same time? I can feel my brain cells committing suicide just by thinking about it.\n\n> I think that nerfing a few numbers would be the best approach. Give his 2nd Q and R less of a AD scaling, so that he has to decide between tankiness OR damage, he cant have both.\n\nYeah, the numbers behind his Q are ridiculous, but I have to disagree with you on his ult. It just got gutted earlier this year, and I feel like people often mistake Lee's ult as doing a lot of damage, when it's really doing a lot of damage when combined with thunderlords, as the ult part of most combos/insecs with lee is when he procs thunderlords.\n\nFor example, the most common combo for insec is too hit your sonic wave on a target, dash to them, ward hop behind them, and kick. Your kick is usually your third attack, and when thunderlords procs, and at times it can look like a stupid amount of damage, when in reality it's technically two abilities proccing at the same time.\n\nIn relation to his tankless, I feel like this is not just a problem with Lee, but with all bruisers. A simple solution to this would be too nerf items like black cleaver, titanic hydra, dead mans plate etc. Heck, they could even nerf his jg item and I would still think it's not too bad an idea (the only problem with that being that it may affect other champions who build that item).\n\n> But i definitely agree, Riot current way of balancing champs is just to re-work them and re-work them until they are balanced, and I think changing Lee's Kit too much, would be a terrible mistake.

His 2nd q animation has clearly activated, and you can hear the sound effect. Thats just some Riot spaghetti code.\n\ntldr: Lee is not in a healthy position imo, and as a champion who is supposed to \"fall off\" in the late game, he is still too strong.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-21T07:24:24.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like we agree on everything here except Lee's Ult.\n\nI also agree that items like Black Cleaver should be nerfed, it offers way too many useful resources, ways too early in the game.\n\nI will stand my ground a little on Lee's ult though.\n\nIll use my main as an example.\nAzir's wall and Lee's Kick are similar in many ways. \nBoth are used for either insec engages, or instant disengages. Both are capable of knocking back multiple targets.\n_(the man difference of course is that Azir's wall remains as terrain.)_\nBut essentially the two are used nearly identically for the majority of people.\n\nAzir's wall has a base damage of 300, an AP scaling of 60% and a 100 sec cooldown, at max rank. It's also a skill shot.\nLee's Kick has a base damage of 450, an AD scaling of 200% and a 60 sec cooldown, at max rank. It's also targetable. _(and does even more damage to secondary targets)_\n\nAzir is a glass cannon DPS mage. Whose only purpose in life is to do as much damage for as long as possible.\nwhile Lee is a tanky disruptive fighter with hordes of utility. Whose purpose is to do literally everything and anything.\n\nI see no reason why Lee's Kick should do more damage more regularly, than Azir's wall. _(the wall which is probably too strong already)_\nIve seen tank Lee's without thunderlords, half health ADC's that were hit by the flying target.\n\nHowever in saying all this, a Q nerf might well be enough to put him back in line, and the ult could be left as it is!\nIm not a Lee player so I don't have as good of a feel for him as someone like you would.\n\nBut in my opinion, Lee's ult is used too regularly as an execute or for kill steals, which is blatantly wrong for an ability that is clearly supposed to be more about utility _(and is basically a death sentance for insec targets anyway)_. While you wouldn't dare use something like Azir's ult as an execute, because the utility is far too valuable.\n\nI think that if you could even consider using a utility ult for an execute, its clearly doing too much damage or has too short of a cooldown.\n\nThats just my opinion though of course!\n\nYea I agree that bard should have gotten away, i have brought this to the attention of Riot for a long time now, and it still hasn't been fixed. Despite killing a lot of people fairly regularly.\n\nIn short, Lee is a great champ, with so much potential for fun, which in my opinion is ruined by how many of them there are due to the stigma about him having such a large impact on the game without much fall off.\nI think it would be beneficial for true Lee mains, as well as the majority of people who play against him.
