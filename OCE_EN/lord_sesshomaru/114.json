The inbuilt replay function is great for that. While playing flawlessly may not have been a guaranteed win, using the things you did wrong and improving them will aid you in future games. You cannot improve your teammates, so don't even try. Focus on yourself and yourself only.\n\nI could be in Challenger if I desired, but I have a notorious 'quitter complex' and I give up at the slightest thing. Even if I don't afk, someone dying or feeding does it for me and I stop trying.\n\nAnother thing is to stop playing after two losses. Stop. Just go play normals and relax. Play the champ that beat you and learn how they work. I play so many normals because of the reason above. I like to have fun (which gets me banned 9/10) and thus I spend a majority of my time in normals, but it's good. If you lose 3 ranked games, win 6 normals and then go back to ranked.\n\nAs for you demanding a tank, don't. Allow people to play whatever they desire. I can't play tanks to save my life and if I'm forced to play one, then I'm going to suck. I'm an aggressive player. I cannot play defensively. Tanks don't win games. There's no point having a tank if they cannot actually tank. I like to compare it to having a healer in an MMO that just swaps to damage and nukes down bosses instead of healing.","replies":[{"poster":"DiannaAgron","date":"2017-06-15T10:24:47.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"are you s3?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-06-14T04:07:47.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the advice man!\n\nI appreciate the no troll too xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2017-06-12T07:21:09.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes yes, welcome to the dark side.\n\nJoin me in the rage posts, sink to my level.\n\nBut no seriously, for someone who is usually like \"its not your teams fault its you\" on my posts, i expect better from you than to be this hypocritical.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-06-12T09:36:07.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hardly a rage post, more self-pity than anything else.\n\nWhile I agree that you should never flame your team.\nIm not naive enough to think that it's _never_ their fault, or that it's never yours.\nIt's a team game, which means 5 people need to work together, thats a lot of room for error.\n\nA LOT of team complaints are down to players not willing to blame themselves for bad calls.\nBut inevitably there are some games where you did everything in your power and it wasn't enough. \n\nIm certainly not saying all games are like that, but these last 5 of mine were, _(and as you know, I'm not one who is quick to blame others.)_\nIve had plenty of games this season where the loss has been mostly my fault. \n\nAm I a hypocrite?

You see tankless teams all the time in the pros. But watching those matches I've learnt one thing. If you want to win with a tankless comp you need to either stomp early and snowball to a win or execute a flawless macro rotation game around objectives.
