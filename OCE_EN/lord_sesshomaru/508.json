But the whole reason for keeping them out was that Xayah and Rakan had no other available skins.\n\nI don&#039;t see what has changed?\n\nYea they got SSG skins. which unless I&#039;m mistaken, are also unavailable?\n\nI can see both sides here, Valentines skins are seen as legacy, so for the players who already have them, its nice to have a little bit of exclusivity _(who doesn&#039;t like to feel special? Especially when its your favourite champ). _ And they were marketed as part of a skin line that is now known for being legacy content.\n\nHowever: Unless you have secret brand-spanking new skins for them ready to release next patch, you&#039;ll be essentially reverting a champion _(technically two champions)_ back to only having their release skin available?  So any new players, will be in the exact same situation as players were **2 whole years ago**. _(just with the added bonus of seeing other people have skins, but just being unable to get them yourself)._\n\nTwo champs with nothing but release skins available, two years after they debuted.  \nIsn&#039;t that very much a step in the wrong direction?\n\n\nIt&#039;s just my opinion of course, but I think allowing players to have a selection of skins for a champ _(as opposed to just one)_, is more important than making a few existing players feel special \nabout their purchases.\n\nIf we have to retire skins _(which I must admit i&#039;m not really a fan of to begin with)_, maybe Lux or Yi or someone with skins to spare might be more palatable?","replies":[]}
