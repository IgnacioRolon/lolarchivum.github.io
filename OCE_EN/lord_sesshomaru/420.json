(please help)","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just went to play a ranked game on my main account, after 4 min of waiting i thought \"nah never mind\" and clicked the x button on the waiting for game thing, just after i pressed it, i got a warning saying something like \"you cannot exit search while a game is found\" or something like that, then after delaying a few seconds it gave me the usual Accept/decline thing so i clicked accept, but it wouldn't show me how many other people have accepted, then when the time ran out it stayed on the waiting for other players window for ages and i couldn't do anything not even click the quit client button then finally it went away, and i clicked the find ranked game button again and got a message saying \"You will not be allowed to join the queue because you are currently assigned to an existing game\" so i clicked ok and waited and nothing happened so i tried again and got the same message, so i waited maybe like 15 seconds and nothing so i clicked the quit client button and just after i clicked it it put me into champion select and then quit, so now i have lost LP and have a penalty.\r\n\r\ni know that you wont take the penalty away you have made that perfectly clear in other posts, so i won't ask. I'm not sure if you can restore LP or not, but if you can and this scenario fits the criteria for that then that would be great if you could. but what i will ask is that you please look at the system, and find a way to make it that if you click the leave search button before or after a game is found it quits you from the search no matter what, and if a game is found it automatically declines you, so that no one else has to suffer the same fate. :)\r\nand until that can happen i would advise people to either commit 100% to playing the game no matter how long the wait and not click the stop search button or just not play at all, to avoid this. but you have to be pretty unlucky for it to happen just at the same time.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Chapter","date":"2015-02-25T08:18:13.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1 for awareness.
