When he gobbles me in a fight going south.\r\n\r\nIm not 100% sure way this change was made, but it seems contrary to the play style of the champ.\r\nHe's supposed to be about pulling people out of the fire.  And in my humble opinion really removes a lot of his relevance and play making ability.\r\n\r\nIf anything I'd nerf his fighting potential, he does a lot of damage for someone who doesn't build much damage, (And when he does build damage in top lane, he still lives too long).  He was intended as a support, not a juggernaut, why remove his support capability to balance his place in the game?\r\n\r\nFrom the looks of the description in the patch notes, he was changed almost exclusively because of the pros and how they play.  Yes they are in the spotlight, but they are also a very small percentage of the player base.  Should we really make such drastic changes to a champion and their role on the way a handful of players perform?","replies":[{"poster":"CAPTAINKILLER","date":"2019-06-09T13:21:13.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot fix your fking game, why is he one shooting every top laner even he is a tank","replies":[]}]}
