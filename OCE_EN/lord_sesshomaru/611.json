How exactly are they calculated?","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a lot of conflicting happening in the new TFT.\nFor example Crystal prevents your champions taking more than X amount of damage.  However Predator executes champions below 25% HP.  I've noticed the game chooses to favour predator in this matchup, executing Crystal champions regardless of their trait. \n\nOr if you make an Assassin a Berserker using Black cleaver _(their leap passives are contradictory)_.\n\nDesert _(reduces all enemy champs' armour by 90%)_ and warden _(wardens have 400%)_ seem to be rather conflicting too.\nTake this example:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Q27euYy\n\nThis dude built full warden with a lvl 3 Braum with 2 thornmails.  So I prioritised maxing the desert trait to counter that.  Yet clearly shown here, Braum's armour does not seem to be reduced by 90% _(I'm no mathematician, but I find it hard to believe that his non-reduced armour stat is 8800)_.\n\nHowever, when I tried a similar Braum strategy; 4 wardens + 1 thornmail (250% armour) vs 2 desert (50% armour reduction).  My Braum's armour is indeed reduced from over 400 to 206.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/DuiT0H0\n\nSo if someone could explain this inconsistency, and tell me how the traits are calculated _(specifically the conflicting/countering ones)_ I'd be very appreciative.\n\nA lot of success in TFT comes down to understanding what's going on in the battles _(and strategising around that knowledge)_.  And I don't understand this.","replies":[{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-11-14T18:19:53.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Execution conditions bypass crystal (e.g pure dmg or thinking everybody's going to be truthful but then reality hits) but that doesn't make predator king, I've tried pred teams 4-7 matches in a row once and got countered enough to start trying to learn even more (lovely, not sarcasm). Dunno if your berserker assassin made it to the back then GREAT back row clearing or if new trait replaces the previous then that'd be more balanced and not so op (because safe back row) too. You can keep an assassin on the front row if enemies are up against them too (so neat, not sarcasm). Yeah I don't really read champ stats much unless they really matter, can't help from there on, I just learn rates by heart off hp bars and items instead of memorizing numbers. You shoulda tried magic aoes or magic dps vs mass armor (mass statik shiv n etc). Beta still had a bunch of stuff unaddressed too like Tristana shojins not stacking or guinsoos blade-master-gunslinger (mentioning it for when there's full gunslinger trait on) Graves not becoming The Flash. Don't forget Braum ult? o.-","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-11-16T05:16:05.512+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Predator for the most-part seems to be an early-mid game powerhouse that falls off in favour of other classes in late game.\nBut I'm not a fan of conflicting passives like Crystal predator (as an execute is still 'damage').\n\nAs for the Warden, yes magic teams would be good, and I did already have a powerhouse Azir, however the braum also had a Dragon Claw, and it was too late in the game to swap out my team,  However a 90% armour reduction should well fall within the bounds of a 'counter'.

Have you tried making Skarner The Flash yet lol, I haven't seen him turn into a beyblade yet, why'd so many kids' animes turn weird, like game/anime expos on...eh (not sure about rules, seen the game pop up the rules agreement thing 2-3 times now in the last 5 months but 1-2 from assholes making me restart the game with black screen freeze) too much happy time. The item drop rate looks rigged/cheated too sometimes, not really sure since it's supposed to be random I think (e.g 3 spatulas 1 match or 3-4 chainmails 1 round and 1 time a bunch of spatulas in 1 round lol, 1 other person  mentioned getting it and even his/her friend too). I really hope it's random and not situational drops, if it is random it just must be like the land drop rate situation in Magic The Gathering years ago being bad even with suggested ratio unless that got rigged/cheated too (e.g 8-11 land cards in a row in 3-4 matches in 2 days)\n\nme too, do you ever see enemies with mini buffs that aren't visible please? e.g regen, atk speed, hp amount or even lifesteal, I only saw 1 other forum mentioning it like 3-4 months ago or ai blocking you from hindering enemies you want to hinder? Have you learned the champion drop rate for shop yet please, I think they fixed it because I tried going purist for a specific team combo (instead of trait) once or I just got lucky with nobody else picking them. lol I'd probably be Shippo if I was from Inuyasha or Shippo's dad, unless he was evil??? Didn't/Never really saw him though, just know that he died saving him. Those fox demon kids made me question fox demons though lol xD https://img.sharetv.com/shows/episodes/standard/746980.jpg.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
