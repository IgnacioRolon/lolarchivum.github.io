These types of tanks are useful precisely because they are a damage threat whilst being hard to kill. Other tanks, like braum, or nautilus or alistar etc are useful because they are hard to kill and repeatedly cc people during a fight. Add to that the fact their only gap closers are movespeed boosts (apart from shyv ult) which makes them very susceptible to getting kited, and you can hardly say they have no tradeoffs. If someone like braum had comparible damage there would be no reason to ever play those 3.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-01-16T23:50:51.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's fair because they are easy to kite. As long as you have a half competent support, he should be able to get these guys off you, provided they aren't super fed.\n\nThe real problem is Zed, Rengar, LeBlanc and Talon. As a support main those are the hardest to peel. Garen is just a hook and focus, and Shyvanna's only dash has a huge wind-up time and can be interrupted. \n\nMundo is OP ATM, but back in the day it was so easy to kite him. He tends to leave lane ahead or fed right now, so he needs a bit more teamwork to deal with him usually.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-01-17T00:43:32.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Telecasterdude,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=0lwt53EY,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-01-16T23:50:51.921+0000)\n>\n> As long as you have a half competent, he should, provided they aren't.\n> \n\n\nTheres your problem ^\n\nplus in what world is Mundo easy to kite?? its not like he has a +10000000 move speed ult or a Q that basically snares you. every few seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-01-17T00:51:52.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For those of us not willing to just hyperbole, it's a fairly easy to dodge skillshot, and an ult that is still fairly easy to kite out unless your totally immobile in the first place, and the immobility is more the problem then anything if that's the case.\n\nYou can't complain about inability to kite if you go immobile champs in solo Q.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-01-17T02:27:37.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Firstly. Most ADC's are fairly Immobile, along with a huge chunk of the mages as well, so theres a shitload of champs that shouldn't be used in solo Q according to you.\n\nSecondly. Mundo has 345 base movement speed, most ADC's have 325, so Mundo already starts 20 ahead of them (which means even with boots he will always be 20 ahead, unless he buys speed boots in which case it will be even more), His Q has a 3 second cooldown with CDR, and slows them by 40%, that reduces their move speed to 195 for 2 seconds, meanwhile his own movement speed is increased to 466 for 12 seconds. Thats a 141 faster ms than the adc for 1 second and then 271 difference for 2 seconds and that continues for 12 seconds. \n\nNow let us allow for dashes,\nWith his ult, Mundo will cover 5592 units over the duration\nCorki (as an example) will cover, 3900\nBut Corki has a 600 unit dash, it takes approximately 0.25 seconds to complete, which brings his total distance covered to 4419 units.\nwhich means Mundo still catches up to him way before the duration ends. (and this is without even using his Q) \n\nNow what about Kiting,\nlets use Ashe for this example because she is known as the kiting queen.\nsay our Ashe has a 1.00 AS meaning she releases 1 arrow every second. and her arrows slow the target for 2 seconds (decaying over the duration) She slows Mundo by 50% on every attack except her first which slows by 25%, but by the time the next arrow hits the slow has decreased to 25% (13% on the first arrow) \nin order to simplify the maths we will say that half of the 1 second, Mundo is slowed by 50% and half he is slowed by 25% (this simplification doesn't make any difference to the final result, but it makes the maths much easier to see) \nso the 5592 units he would cover must be broken up into halves, one half is slowed by 50% and the other half is slowed by 25% \n2798 is half of 5592 and 2798 slowed by 50% is 1398, and 2798 slowed by 25% is 2097 which means his total distance covered is now 3495 units, however we need to account for her first attack slowing by half as much, which brings Mundo's units covered to a total of 3673. But Ashe cant shoot an arrow and run at the same time, she needs to stand still for the first half of her attack animation (the windup) which means she needs to stand still for 0.5 seconds per arrow, which means she is running half the time and standing still half the time, which means over the 12 seconds her units travelled is halved from 3900 to 1950.\nwhich means Mundo STILL catches up to her wayyy before the duration ends.\n(and again this is without landing even a single mundo Q)\n\nSo in other words:\n'fairly easy to kite' my ass!","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-01-17T02:32:38.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep let's use corki as an example but make him brain dead and not go over a wall.\n\nAnd ashe as an example and not have her use her ult.\n\nAnd lets assume all of them are 1v1 against this mundo cause sense.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-01-17T03:14:47.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There are no walls in the middle of a lane. say he's pushed between the first bot red turret and the first blue one, what wall is he supposed to go over?\n\nif ults were always up what a wonderful world we would live in, in any case her ult would stun him for 1 second at that close range, which would remove 466 units from his 3673 bringing it to 3207 which means he will STILL catch her.
