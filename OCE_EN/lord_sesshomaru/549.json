Id probably pay _them_.\n\n_________\n\nNow I&#039;m no lawyer, and I&#039;m not sure what all the laws around intellectual property are.  But personally, I think when something becomes an Icon in the public sphere, there should be a little leeway in where it can and can&#039;t be used.\n\nThings like Darth Vader, Superman, Elvis Presley, etc. are known by almost everyone on the planet, they are no longer objects to be sold, they are part of culture as humanity. So you shouldn&#039;t have to post 50c to Disney every time you put Vader&#039;s face on a shirt.\n\nImagine if Clint Eastwood sicked his lawyers on any company that had a cowboy with a cigar and a poncho. There would be no characters left! Least of all Graves and McCree.\n\nThe man has become an Icon, that literally shaped the way the world views the wild west. \nHow can you own that?\n\nBut just as importantly, even if you do own something, and youre not going to be making any money off it anyway, _(Edgar Davids was not about to start up a moba about his face and glasses)_ why should you try and stop someone else from making something cool and tipping their hat to you in the process.\n\nIdk, im no laywer, but it just seems stuck up to me.\nHe's sitting at home rolling in his millions, sees Lucian and is like \n_\"Right! that mildy resembles me! lets get some extra spending money!\"_ as he rubs his hands together in glee.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-08-12T08:55:02.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I actually cracked up a bit, Riot losing money?

A company with 96 million active monthly players, that releases multiple skins every few months, as well as the heaps they make off of hextech crafting chests and other bundles, is the least profitable gaming company? You do realise a lot of players end up spending $300+ just on hextech crafting alone to get exclusive gemstone skins? Every time they release a legendary skin that's $20 AUD in RP PER PERSON who buys one. Bundles are usually around $35 in RP to buy PER PERSON who purchases them. Let's also not forget all the merchandise they also make heaps off of. Every time a new figurine is in stock that's a few extra million they make from players worldwide. You seem to forget that 96 million is a lot of people, and I know not every person likes to spend money on League stuff. But still if even 1 in every 10 League players spent money on League that's still 9.6 million people spending around $27.5 average. Do the math, that's 264 MILLION DOLLARS EVERY MONTH.\n\nSo unless you have some kind of evidence to support your statement I suggest you stop riding the reds and accept the obvious here.","replies":[{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2017-08-29T00:53:42.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps my information was a bit old, but that's no reason to get hostile towards me.\nI just said that they were one of the least profitable, not that they WEREN'T profitable.\n\nDoing a quick search on google:\nRiot from 2013- $624 million to 2017-  $20 billion\nBlizzard 2016- $4 billion to 2017- $1.75 billion (quarterly)\nValve seems to be at a steady $3 - 3.5 billion over the past few years.\n\nSo yes, Rito has shot up from the ground and so came the consequences of being a bigger company >_<","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-08-29T02:53:01.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly why you should do some research before saying such ridiculous things","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-08-13T23:52:11.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Im sure there gonna go bankrupt nowðŸ¤”","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LetsTwitch","date":"2017-08-12T13:25:41.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But...
