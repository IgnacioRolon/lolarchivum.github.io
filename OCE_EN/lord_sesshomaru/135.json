I might be the ADC, but ill be roaming at lvl 1!&quot;\r\n\r\nFor me it is {{champion:136}}  into {{champion:157}}.\r\nYasuo&#039;s Sweeping blade, is a longer range than the inner orbit of your stars, so if you try using the stars to last hit, he can dash straight onto you without even touching the stars. When he is on you (and you cant attack him whatsoever), due to his movement speed and stickiness there is physically no way of getting him off except flashing or using ultimate, you cant even doubletap Q (even though his release page says you can). All you can do is walk to your tower, hoping that you have enough MS to eventually outrun him. This means that to farm you need to use your W which drains your mana so quickly and pushes your lane like no ones business, which leaves you open to ganks and with no mana.\r\nYour Q is slow and the particle is huge, and the wind wall blocks it easily. \r\nIf you know he is about to ult you, and you ult him back (just as soon as his tornado hits you) his knock up lasts long enough that once your ult has finished knocking him back, he still has time to press R and ult you.\r\nSo literally all i can do is stay alive until lvl 3 (or lvl 6 if i want to be properly effective) and just roam for the rest of the laning phase, sacrificing mid turret.\r\n\r\nIm not saying Aurelion Sol is weak and I&#039;m not saying Yasuo is strong, I&#039;m just saying its hell to play that lane, its not like playing against your counter where its hard but if you play smart you&#039;ll be okay, there is legit nothing you can do. You either don&#039;t farm, or are completely at his mercy.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for this circumstance, Aurelion Sol is my favourite champion, so i play him a lot, and Yasuo has a 30% pick rate, which means this lane happens A LOT :(\r\n\r\nanyway, what is your most hellish lane?\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-07-22T00:41:18.705+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:53}} \n\nI am high plat now and I still can't dodge his grabs.

Doesn't matter if you E her, her slow is more effectively and the damage/burst output isn't contestable unless they are somehow really really bad at cs. Once she has her ult, it's over, I have to sit under turret.\n\nI don't care about {{champion:80}} , as much as he's a counter later in the game, he has to get a little bit of feed before he can combo you straight up, and you can at least equally punish him if he all-ins early, {{champion:10}}  there's no real punishment, if you go her, she slows and runs, if she goes you, you E and she still smacks you for most of your health in the duration of her slow.\n\nI guess it's the same with any fire and forget/burst mage though, no skill shots or the ability to stun/snare you into those skillshots ( {{champion:13}} ) are basically counters for {{champion:133}}, a few exceptions, but yeah.","replies":[]},{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-07-22T03:13:04.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:1}} into {{champion:134}} \n\nThe worst experience ever.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-07-23T01:30:12.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds painful, her range must make it hell for you.","replies":[{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-07-23T14:42:09.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=qFeaTyRM,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-07-23T01:30:12.260+0000)\n>\n> That sounds painful, her range must make it hell for you.\n\nSyndra has higher damage and longer range.
