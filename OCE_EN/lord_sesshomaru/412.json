But now he has a Stone mage (whose magic is probably the most similar to his out of all the other champs (seeing how sand and stone are essentially the same thing)) from his own country trying to kill him. AND is now disliked by one of the coolest champs of ionia as a result. \r\n\r\n\r\nPoor Azir :(\r\n\r\nRiot please help him out by giving him a big old nerf for his birthday (or just any other day) to get some of these wannabe pro fanboy copycats off his back!\r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Cola","date":"2016-04-30T16:16:40.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't understand the point of this, you're obviously an azir player but you want him to be nerfed just so others don't play him?
