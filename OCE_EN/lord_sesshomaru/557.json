I never actually caught the reason behind this, so if someone could let me know, id appreciate it. ^^\n\nI really don&#039;t understand though, because so many champs are desperately in need of a VU, but not necessarily a full rework.\n\n\n________\n\nLets take Veigar for example _(he&#039;s in my mind because I&#039;ve been playing him recently)_.\nHe's hideous, but he doesn&#039;t need a re-work _(maybe some balance changes.. \nbut not a rework.)_\n\nHis model is actually horrible, I genuinely salute the dedication of anyone who plays him without a skin....\nHis voice is just as bad. I know it&#039;s supposed to be a whiny high-pitched Yordle voice, to add humour to the fact that he is the most dangerous sorcerer in the world, but it&#039;s just so ear-splittingly screechy thats it&#039;s just straight up annoying. \n\nNot to mention his vastly outdated particles _(like seriously what does he actually use as magic? His Autos are like black/blue/green with a yellow trail, his Q is a light purple, his W is a dark blue and dark purple, his E is black, green, and pink? and his R is light blue. None of it makes any sense, especially seeming he&#039;s supposed to be using &#039;dark magic&#039;)_\nand because he is so jumbled, it makes his theme weak.\n\nAll of this makes Veigar just unpleasant to play. \n\nGeninuley you&#039;re only ever going play Veigar because of his damage.\nNo one wakes up in the morning thinking _&quot;Oh I cant wait to play a little... wizard? who... pretends.. oh! no no **is** evil... I think?..&quot;_\nInstead they wake up thinking _&quot;Can&#039;t wait to shred some noobs as a badass wind-wielding samurai warrior!&quot;_\n\n________\n\nRiot has put so much effort into giving champions distinct themes like Sol and Ivern, it&#039;s painful to see these old champs whose only theme is that they are basically time-capsules into what the game used to be.\n\nLike many other old champs (Udyr, Rumble etc.) his legendary _(Final Boss)_ skin has pretty much become his base skin, because unlike the actual champion, it has a theme and a story that people can understand and see while playing it.\n\nThis post isn&#039;t about Veigar though, he is just one example.\nRumble, Corki, Udyr, Blitz, Jax, Kennen, Morde etc etc.\nAll are champs that don&#039;t really need a rework, but just look and feel so bad to play without their good skins _(and some of them don&#039;t even have any)_. \n\nWhat is going to happen to them? is Riot going to purposely rework them just to give them a VU? _(which seems horrible to force a rework down their throats for that reason alone)_ Or are they just going to be left as eyesores for years and years until they _have_ to do something about them.\n\nAfter seeing how slick Karthus and twitch are after their VU&#039;s, I don&#039;t understand why they scrapped the whole VU thing, when it&#039;s just as _(probably more)_ important than all these mini-reworks going on.\n\nWhat are everyone&#039;s thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2017-08-05T15:14:16.377+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reasoning was the most of the champs that need VU also need Gameplay updates, and they are easier to do together rather than doing a VU and a year or two later building a Gameplay update off of that.\n\nBasically doing a full VGU provides more impact and can be done more efficiently than giving one champion a Gameplay update and another a VU.  Which means that so long as there are champions that need VGU's it makes more sense to do the big offenders who hit both categories rather than the smaller fries who only hit the VU requirement but could probably use a Gameplay update too.\n\nRiot is more heavily limited by the Art side than the Gameplay design side due to the nature of Art taking longer, being harder to coordinate, and not being finish-able until after the gameplay side is done.  This means that they can afford to do more gameplay update than VU or VGUs.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-05T22:15:51.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, thanks!\nI thought it might be something along those lines.\n\nBut it still leaves champs like Veigar up in the air.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-08-06T01:58:26.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you read Veigar's lore? I don't want Riot to touch him because they butcher lore and I love his lore. I also don't want another Lux where his voice lines go from good to questionable. Veigar only needs a visual improvement. Pretty sure he still has pizza feet.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-06T11:39:46.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I've read his lore.\nI do actually really like the character!\n\nThe general principle of his lore good:\nThings went south, trapped and isolated, driven crazy etc, and now the world suffers for it. its pretty cool.\n\nBut they could so easily re-write it with the same story but with the current standards of writing, _(not just 1 paragraph for a lore)_.\n\nand they need to hone his essence, like: does he have like a bat-cave in Bandle city? Or does he roam the earth bringing destruction and giggles in his wake?\n\nHe uses dark cosmic magic, but dark magic looks like Zed's shit, and Cosmic magic looks like Sol's shit, and Veigar's magic looks like neither, so that needs to be clarified and updated.\n\nI like his voice lines, but cant stand his voice!\n\nAlso yea, Riot butchers old lores... Thresh uses to be badass, and now I don't even know what he is...","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-08-06T03:37:51.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i wanna get the chance to build 2 ap items with full tank and still be able to oneshot squisies by pressing r late game ðŸ˜Ž\n\nRiot Plz stop reworking every damn champion that isnt a meta abused boring spammed everygame pos.the people that play them actually enjoy playing them as they are.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-08-05T15:56:32.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So many champs that have had visual updates ... i rember league in 2011.... it was very different.","replies":[]}]}
