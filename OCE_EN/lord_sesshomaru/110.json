The video is shown in slow motion for easy analysis.\n\nIn the video, I am keeping as much distance as I can from him (due to his tendency of suddenly jumping on you). I am already missing farm _(and have been for a while)_, and when I do go for what little farm I can get from the &quot;safe distance&quot;, I am using the fully extended stars (they have 100 more range than my Autos) so i am at absolute maximum range here, any safer and I am missing farm completely. \n\nBut even at maximum range, Fizz can hit his ult with ease, use his E to close the gap _(and it still hits me!)_, and then... well he&#039;s inside my stars with half his combo left, and theres nothing i can do, even under my turret.\n\nI just want to farm, at maximum range, while using mana to do so.\nBut the way i currently play, i cant even do that. \n\n__________\n\nSo what should I be doing?\nHow can I farm, while not being at this much risk of being 100-0 in allied territory? \n\nI know Fizz had the level advantage, but to be completely honest, my ult doesn&#039;t really help much in this situation anyway, the delay between cast and impact on Voice of Light, is longer than the delay between Fizz landing from his E, and then using Q. And Its near impossible to predict exactly where his Q will deposit him AND time it correctly, so you cant aim there either. So while he does have the level advantage, it wouldn&#039;t make as big of a difference as you think, even if we were both lvl 6. \n\n**Also:** when the fish struck me, it put Comet of Legend on cooldown, _(something that only damage is supposed to do)_, and the fish does no damage until the shark erupts. So i don&#039;t understand why Comet of Legend was put on cooldown. \n\nSo if someone could assist me, and let me know what I was doing wrong, and how I should be playing the situation, that would be so much appreciated ^^\n_(also if someone could explain why Comet of Legend was put on cooldown when the fish hit me, that would be very insightful.)_\n\nThanks heaps :)\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-12-13T22:41:56.443+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"unless you have zhonyas fizz landing his ult is pretty much a death sentence","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-12-13T20:55:39.706+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Biggest thing to note, _Being at a longer range is actually bad_.\n\nFizz's new shark actually increases in damage and size at range, so the further you are, if the shark is spot on, the harder it is to dodge, though this isn't optimal for Aurelion, this is just a general thing.\n\nAs for this example, you move straight backward from his ult, instead of diagonally or sideways from the skillshot, it is actually a really long skillshot now (the shark you are tagged with is the medium range) so dodge to the sides to make sure the ult doesn't hit you.\n\nWhen he throws the shark, use your Q, if he gap closes effectively it won't matter (in other words if the enemy fizz knows what he is doing) but a bad fizz (this fizz included) will actually be stunned by The Q, as it will get to popping range before he finished gap closing.\n\nOtherwise your basically dead in lane in most scenarios, and your best chance is a good jungler gank.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-12-13T18:58:54.558+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you suspect his ult, You should be able to flash it, that way he misses out on so much DMG, retract your stars, and try and kite him under tower and stun him.\n\nIf this wasn't blind- \nTry running Exhaust or Clense.\n\nExhaust means he does 50% less dmg, and his armor - MR is also reduced.\nCleanse, means even if you get hit by a shark, you should be able to cleanse it and run away.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-13T20:35:27.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the advice!\nBoth our flashes were down, so unfortunately that wasn't an option this time.
