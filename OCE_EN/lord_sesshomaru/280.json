I have also had so many games where I farm champions and get an A. Pretty sure a kill gives gold equivalent to roughly 14 minions. Lets say we made your kills 0 and your cs 300. You would likely get an S for that game even though its the same gold earned overall and you arguably helped your team much less.\n\nRiot has said they wanted to weigh it on stuff like cs or objectives/wards way heavier than kills because they don't want people playing team deathmatch and last hitting kills for an S. I can understand their reasoning but frankly it shouldn't be this bad. They need to make kills worth at least a bit more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-07T00:20:54.911+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Small volume of games limited mostly to mains of the champion means that the top x% of scores you need to beat/match to get the S are gonna be pretty dang high.\n\nI think it soft resets with the season though, so maybe give it another sus in the first week or so of S8?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-01-07T03:11:40.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed the top scores will be high, especially on champs like Sol who is only played by mains.\nBut I find it hard to believe that even die-hard 1-trick Sol mains in this current meta don't average scores like 13/0/17. and if they do, Sol needs to be nerfed into the ground!\n\nIn my opinion of course, the system should mildly take into account the champions on the enemy team.\nFor example a Nasus who goes 5/0/7 against a Nautilus, won't have played as well as a Nasus who gets the same score against a Teemo.\n\nBut it'll be interesting to see what season 8 brings :P\nI hope a change of meta for a start xD","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-07T03:23:59.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Remember though than an S grade isn't the average by a long shot. B~ is the average grade, and remember that with bell curves the number of S grades is going to be a very small percentage, where Bs (or is it C? not sure) has the most, then A has exponentially less and so on.\n\nObviously enemy team comp is a consideration, but it complicates things way more for something that is already essentially recognised in whether you win or lose. Can you imagine trying to balance mastery grades for every champion against every other champion? For a system that doesn't impact gameplay or game health at all, that's a huge and probably impossibly difficult investment.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Psylock1234","date":"2018-01-07T10:26:38.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lmao guess the areliuoun sol average kda is too high","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-07T09:43:55.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean CS is and always will be the main metric because it's based on you doing well the whole game, and it's implied that you have to farm well and not have to leave lane to have done well \"all game\"","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-01-07T09:45:26.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sucks to be a roaming champ <_<","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-07T10:01:19.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah the thing with roaming is that it's almost always technically not worth it.\n\nLet's say you roam and it takes 1.5 minutes, and you miss 3 waves (slightly longer then a general roam, but it's easier to do the math this way)\n\nThose 3 waves of CS are worth ~363 Gold at 6 minutes and increase in value as time goes on.\n\nAssuming you have been constantly killing your laner (AKA winning lane for S territory), you can also generally assume that this will give you a low gold kill, and give you tower damage, and give you the ability to drag the jungler for a potential extra kill... all while not missing that farm.\n\nGoing to bot lane, you might get 2 kills, you might get nothing for that minute and a half spent.\n\nIt's utterly selfish, but it is the technical on paper \"best play\" to ignore your teammates.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-07T07:04:04.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"System is busted, some champions are so easy to S on, while others are near impossible.\n\nCS should not matter so much, CS does not win games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2018-01-07T05:22:13.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah some of the grades don't make sense. Going deathless is not easy picking up 13 kills and 17 assists along the way is pretty incredible. I think the most insulting thing there is that not only did you not get an S you didn't even get an A+ like really. Out of interest how long was the game and what was your objective damage like, in my experience those things can play a huge deal. \n\nPersonally though I think cs is currently overvalued in the system. I had a Kha'zix get an s- yesterday with the score 10/4/5 but with 289 cs. He was nigh useless for the entire  game because he was either afk farming the jungle or pushing all the way down top lane and getting collapsed on (because I refused to do it knowing that was exactly what would happen). He got 5 of his kills in the last 4 minutes. Yet I have seen Kha'zix's face-roll a team on their way to an easy win and not get an S. Knowing its on a grading scale makes this specific example even more confusing.\n\nEdit: Also hard luck Sessh, that feeling of \"Wait that wasn't an S, what\" is pretty shit\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Evelynnie","date":"2018-01-06T22:40:39.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CS is a very large contributor.
