I'm talking about \"nerfs\"\n\nlike to the champion that you cant duel because warlords and 1 lifsteal item overheals any sustained damage you might give him. \n\nNerfing Tank Yasuo is like nerfing full AP Alistar.

Mortal reminder shuts that healing down hard. Also CC. Exhaust works too. Range, just force him to wind wall then force him to waste it or make him chase. Move around and dont get hit by his nado which is simple as fuck. \n\nThere are millions of ways to fight him. \n\nThing is you need to not feed the fuck out of him first. Focus gank him, even if you are bot and his mid, you go up and force him out of lane even at 3.  If his top and you are mid, go gank him. He doesn't do well when pressured early.\n\nThe only time i ever see him as a problem is at the 30 min mark when you let him farm all day and get kills. Otherwise his a useless champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-09-09T13:42:41.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Moral reminder is great... but not if you happen to play AP (which no one does these days, but i still play AP)\n\nYou know a champ is unbalanced when your go to strategy of fighting them is _\"Dude you need to 3v1 him early!\"_\n\nYou try playing Aurelion Sol into any half decent Yasuo... good fucking luck.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TwoHeadedFreak","date":"2016-09-08T10:20:51.773+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not much of a nerf on his ult - he gets to 100% crit so early, it will have very little effect","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2016-09-08T16:34:18.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i long for the days where he has to build 3 crit items to max it out\n\n\nEDIT: or better yet consider this, no crit multiplier unless his ult is in effect","replies":[]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2016-09-08T12:13:24.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tank Yasuo: {{item:3047}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3022}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3026}} \n\nThe only actual nerf to Tank Yasuo this patch also hurt Glass Cannon Yasuo because Tank Yasuo built 50% (100% with passive) crit chance anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-09-08T10:26:46.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At the same time as Zed. It doesn't matter if versing them ruins the fun of the game because they have overloaded kits, they're 'popular' LCS champs and'll never be touched with a decent nerf. Yasuo needs a complete kit change for him to be healthy. An ability that blocks all projectile son a 12s cd? Not to mention it's an entire lane wide? That should be his ult tbh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-08T01:44:20.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I heard they're considering some nerfs for 6.18 the worlds patch by weakening his armour pen so that it only works with his crits.
