How come Olaf&#039;s ultimate &#039;Ragnarok&#039; has a Japanese character on it? Historically the Vikings never set foot in Japan, the events of Ragnarok have nothing to do with Japan or its culture, Olaf himself has nothing to do with Iona or Japan. Secondly the character in question means &#039;Power&#039; but the events of Ragnarok have nothing to do with power, its essentially the end of the world as we know it where the gods and fallen warriors of ages past are killed by monsters. Now i know how well thought out champs are, we can see from the insight riot gives us after a new champ comes out. so there must be a valid reason, i just want to know what it is. I cant believe that someone at riot was just like: &quot;hey lets put a Japanese character on his ult pic&quot; and no one questioned it.\r\n\r\n2. How come turret shots deal no damage to you if the turret itself dies while the bullet is mid flight?\r\nby that logic, if i kill lux while her Q is mid flight it shouldn&#039;t hurt me, but it does... So why?\r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-03-05T02:52:25.050+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"At Riot Games we don't give a fuck about logic.\n\nWe just do it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-03-05T04:35:16.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"who's to say the character isnt chinese. The base of japanese was stolen from china afterall\n\nAnd the \"Power\" logic, is it gives OLAF power, immunity and damage is considered power","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-03-05T09:26:57.942+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The character is the same in both languages, so you can call it whatever language you want, it literally doesn't matter, the character looks identical, i am just more familiar with Japan than with China so i used Japanese instead of Chinese to describe it.\n\nAnd it was hardly 'Stolen' Japan was settled by the Chinese early in its history who brought with them their language and way of life and it evolved from there. Thats like saying the Americans 'stole' the english language, no, America was settled by many nations, predominately those from English speaking countries. English itself is a language comprised of 'stolen' words, the word Berserk comes from the Norse word Berserker (From which Olaf is also named) words like 'Die' 'Egg' 'Birth' also have Viking origin, even the word Wednesday comes from the god Odin. So Japanese is as much 'stolen' from China as english is 'stolen' from the Vikings.\n\nHe also loses Armour and Magic resist though, which could be seen as 'Weakness' Although it does fit with the Berserker theme (a warrior who went into a trance and jumped into battle with no regard for defence) I do understand the reasoning for Power (all ults are powerful)\n\nbut my query was less to do with the meaning of the Character, and more to do with why it was in Japanese, which is of absolutely no relation to Vikings whatsoever. I would have though a character from the Viking Runic alphabet would be more appropriate, i just wanted to know RIOT's reasoning behind it. Its like using an Egyptian hieroglyph on Zed's ult, it just doesn't make sense.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-03-05T09:58:13.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it actually means force in Chinese, its similar but not the same.
