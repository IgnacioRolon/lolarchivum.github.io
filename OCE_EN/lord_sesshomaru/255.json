She has weaknesses to assassins, but sleepy trouble bubble is too much of a crutch for newer zoe players.\n\nShe is fun though, and I think people who complain about the q damage don't understand that the issue lies in her e. If she lands a full windup q, you should expect to be chunked (similar to old nidalee spears), but the e makes it a little too easy to land.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-12-02T01:47:45.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The E isn't as reliable as you think, and it's also her only defensive tool, so if she uses her E and misses, you can freely engage on her. She also has the same weakness as Aurelion, once you're inside her range she's screwed. Even if she hit's the E if it's pre 6 she's not gonna get anything too spectacular out of it without help, and if it's post 6 that window she's trying to land the Q leavers her vulnerable (the ult is longer than you think, you can't just dive in with it cause you're so squishy you can very easily die in that short duration).\n\nIf there was something I would nerf about her it'd honestly be her mana costs. The Q is so free early that there's no reason not to use it almost every time it's off CD. Increasing the mana cost would make Zoe's have to manage their resources better, choose when to poke well rather than just poking whatever they can you know?\n\nShe struggles against CC tanks and assassins, she's kinda the opposite of Morgana in that respect. \n\nAll that said though, I've been playing her in support. Not that I haven't been building damage but I'm still using gold on things like SS and not getting nearly as many balloons (I'm not gonna steal cattys or melees from my ADC if they need em).","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-12-02T07:21:51.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh I've been playing her mid, and she just feels too oppressive in non-assassin matchups. Like what is a ryze supposed to do? How is a tailyah supposed to play aggro and zone you, even if she's fed? How is casseo supposed to get her damage off?\n\nand how does a non-assassin jungler gank you? As udyr or skarner or trundle or volibear, it's just horrible since if you want any chance of killing her, you generally will be burning your flash to get over that e.\n\nYeah sure she sucks vs assassins, it's really polarising, but her e is very difficult to deal with for mages and tanks. She certainly doesn't need a nerf vs assassins, but she's too good against mages, and once she's worked out I feel she's going to need a nerf.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-12-02T08:30:18.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Champs like Taliyah, I agree, she's a counter, dunno if I'd go so far as to say hard counter, I mean as Taliyah to do well you have to have real good positioning, and good positioning can mitigate a lot of Zoe's E power but certainly not an easy matchup. \n\nSomeone like Ryze, I've never really played so I don't really know, I would say his strength against Zoe would just be pushing her hard and getting in her face. Not so much a try to poke her out situation and more like a Rene or Darius kinda deal where if they get close you punish em hard. Zoe is hella squish and very weak at close range, so I'd say that's the way around it.\n\nFor junglers, I've trashed champions like Sej/Rek, but that's in support where I have laner assistance. I agree that most tank junglers are gonna struggle to gank Zoe, but at the same time she doesn't have enough damage to really kill them. Once you've used your E Q you don't really have anymore to offer, so a tank jungle can just walk right back out, so really not the worst tradeoff if they can give their laner some space. She's hard to gank for sure, but I don't feel she's really a huge threat to junglers in mid lane either.\n\nLike I said though, I'm a supp main and I haven't played her all that much in mid (really only a couple times) so I don't have direct experience. I feel she'll definitely see some small nerfs as the skill gap catches up (so next patch), but I don't think it will be (or should be) anything too drastic. Maybe mana or CDs more than damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-12-02T11:58:55.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah mana costs, cdr not as desperate, but I feel her e needs more on the delay for the sleep or make it a bit shorter in duration.\n\nThe duration is questionable because tbh I had alot of moments where I landed the e, thought I missed, after a moment, noticed I had cc'd someone and then still had time to setup a max range paddlestar, whereas I feel this needs to be a combo you intentionally land, rather than something you can pull off by accident, i.e. q first then e then q, rather than e, not notice, then q q.\n\n I know this is here to help smooth out the skill slope but i feel a polished champion should be intentional, and I feel Zoe needs to have these weaknesses and difficulties to make her more skill expressive and for the playerbase to eventually feel proud for mastering her kit.\n\nPlaying her (she's a far cry from my usual champions, and I kinda suck), I felt like where I succeeded was more a case of her strength and the crutches that have been given to aid her as a new champion, rather than my own achievement and growth. I can't play her yet, but I'd rather that be quite obvious, so that it can clearly be seen if and when I manage to get the hang of her complex kit.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-12-02T13:01:25.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely takes a while to get used to her kit. I found that once I got used to playing her, her weaknesses became pretty clear. I mean I'm of the belief that the fastest way to learn to play against a champion is to play them so that's really no surprise. \n\nIt's still hard to tell though even having played her quite a bit how much of my success is from Zoe's strength and how much is the enemies ignorance.\n\nSome games it's really obvious the enemy team has no idea, they get so scared cause they got hit by a Q that they back off and set up another long ranger instead of staying close and getting the free kill on me when I'm low health. Or they'll hang around next to the upper walls in bot despite me having used them to sleep them many times. Those are definitely cases of the enemy not realising what she does, more than her being strong.\n\nIn teamfights the sleep is really strong if you hit someone, it's basically a guaranteed kill if your team is on top of it and aren't horribly behind, but Zoe isn't the only one with an ability like that, a lot of assassins (mids in particular) have abilities or combos that have the same result. That's a positioning one.\n\nAll that said though, I pretty much agree with you to varying degrees. Q mana cost I think would be the most effective nerf, maybe an E duration nerf if that's not enough. Nothing huge, just something to, as you say, make it intentional. The fact that you can see if someone gets hit by the E even in fog of war should be plenty if you're paying attention. Biggest concern with dropping the E duration is that it'd remove a lot of her early game power. Without your ult it's a lot harder to set up those pokes.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
