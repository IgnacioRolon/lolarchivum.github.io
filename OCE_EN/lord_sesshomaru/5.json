(TPA Ezreal already has hair colour close to the suggested colour of this skin's hair) so please post your opinions as well to see if you agree with me or if i am alone in my beliefs.\r\n\r\nAttached (hopefully if i can work these new boards) is a comparison of the old hair on the bottom of the picture and the alternative i have done on photoshop on the top of the picture.\r\n\r\nWhile i understand from Riots perspective that this isn't a money making venture for them, it does up the value of the skin in general and increase \r\nin game visual quality.","replies":[{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2014-11-26T00:02:31.206+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"the golden yellow definitely looks better ;p","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2014-11-26T00:10:30.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks I'm glad I'm not the only who thinks so :P","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2014-11-26T10:44:04.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"T0dE0jxZ8O","date":"2014-11-26T00:49:53.260+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"New golden hair is WAAAAYYY better RIOT plz update it!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2014-11-30T04:22:59.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im glad you think so, i rely hope they do.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"P1 GTR","date":"2014-11-26T07:11:11.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the bottom one","replies":[]},{"poster":"BfM DevOuR","date":"2014-11-26T06:01:01.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Prefer the old, no one likes a fkn ginger kid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Major Armstrong","date":"2014-11-26T04:38:18.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could be, I have no knowledge of such things.
