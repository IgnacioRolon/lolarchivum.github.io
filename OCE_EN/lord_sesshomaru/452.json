Thats a very specific Voli situation, if you put voli and WW together at low HP fighting, WW would win.\nHecarim can move faster in short bursts, like rammus, but WW can move faster for a much much more constant time, and his speed is still close. So WW is moving faster than hec in total. Skarner and WW have an even amount of CC its true, but a fear is more devastating than a slow, and his is AoE.\n\nSo i have told no lies.\n\nThe thing is, he has ALL of that.\n\nI actually play WW, so I'm not anti-him\nhe just has too much.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-08-09T06:30:07.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Aatrox life steals on every 3rd attack and even then thats assuming he isnt using it for damage (which is where his main damage comes from so you are often using it), so WW actually life steals more.\n\nI don't see your argument here, aatrox can ALWAYS lifesteal where WW has to be below 50% health, you just repeated what I said.\n\n> Ivern can smite what? 2? camps every coupe of minutes, otherwise he has to wait for aaaages. \n\nHe can smite 2 camps then instantly go gank a lane, he has the earliest gank time in the game.\n\n>Thats a very specific Voli situation, if you put voli and WW together at low HP fighting, WW would win.\n\nBecause a passive that triggers every 2 minutes is \"very specific\"","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-09T08:46:04.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I don't see your argument here, aatrox can ALWAYS lifesteal where WW has to be below 50% health, you just repeated what I said.\n\nMy argument is that Aatrox _can_  heal, but only on every **3rd** auto attack _(at best, seeming it is often off, so it is actually less than that)_. \nSo if his health is decreasing at a constant rate from 100-0, Aatrox is lifestealing for **30%** of the time, so he is isn't 'always' lifestealing.\n\nMeanwhile Warwick heals on every auto attack but only when under 50% HP.\nSo, if his health is decreasing at a constant rate from 100-0, Warwick is lifestealing for 50% of the time. _Not to mention that Warwick also can heal for a large chunk of damage with his Q at any time._\n\nSo Warwick is lifestealing for 20% more of the duration that he is alive, than Aatrox is.\n_And that is excluding the fact that Aatrox might not have his W on, and that WW can heal with his Q as well._\n\nIm not the best at explaining things _(I often over complicate my point, sorry)_, so I've made a quick diagram showing what I mean.\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/2e78cb0665062ae66ac9181085dca93b.jpg\n\nAnd if we choose to include lifesteal from Warwick's ult.. well, then he wins buy a long shot.\n\n> He can smite 2 camps then instantly go gank a lane, he has the earliest gank time in the game.\n\nAs for Ivern, we arent discussing the earliness of ganks, we are discussing clear times, and we are discussing the champions, not necessarily spells _(remember that smite is 'optional', it isn't actually part of the champion)_.\nand without outside interference, as just a champion Warwick can clear a camp much faster than Ivern.\n\n> Because a passive that triggers every 2 minutes is \"very specific\"\n\nWhat I was referring to as specific, was Volibear happening to have his passive, his passive procing, and him running away avoiding death only due to the healing factor, and the same situation applying to Warwick, but Warwick dying due to not being healed. Which you cant deny is a 'specific' situation.\nHowever when we refer to Warwick's survivability, 'running away' isn't usually what we are referring to. And I have no doubt that a full HP Warwick attacking you, is a lot harder to kill than a full health Volibear attacking you. That is what I meant by 'harder to kill'.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Monkey Max","date":"2017-08-08T09:37:08.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah he's good and easy as hell, I play him (or Yi) when I'm tilted for an easy game.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]}
