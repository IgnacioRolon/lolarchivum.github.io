But if you read the tooltip for the Oathsworrn buff _(black spear icon in the buffs/debuffs area)_ it says that the Oathsworn **ONLY** knocks up the first target hit.\r\n\r\n_________\r\n\r\nThis is a huge difference, especially from the Oathsworn&#039;s perspective, _(seeming that they don&#039;t have access to the correct Fate&#039;s Call tooltip.) _\r\nThe support could read the buff tooltip and understand that they only knock up the first target hit. While Kalista knows that they knock up everyone _(unless Kalista read the wrong tooltip as well)._\r\n\r\nThat could potentially cause a major communication error when fighting, Kalista press R with the intention to knockup the whole team, but the support chooses to abort instead, because the don&#039;t want to be thrown into a 1v5 just to knock up 1 person. Then Kalista is suddenly left facing a whole team, alone.\r\n\r\nIt also calls the CC itself two very different things, the Oathsworn buff calls it a Knockup, while Fate&#039;s call calls it a knock back, _(which are two completely different things) _\r\n\r\nAnd unlike champions like Yasuo/Zed/Vayne/Lucian who are in every game, and every player knows inside out. Kalista is hardly seen, and a lot of people dont know what she can do _(most of the supports in lane with me, don&#039;t even know that they can last hit minions for me)_ so it is indeed likely that people could get confused and think the wrong things. \r\n\r\nIn any case, wether it causes a mis-communication or not, there shouldn&#039;t be conflicting information of any kind, anywhere in any tooltip. \r\n\r\nCan we please see a change here :) for clarity&#039;s sake.\r\n\r\n{{champion:429}} {{item:3599}}","replies":[]}
