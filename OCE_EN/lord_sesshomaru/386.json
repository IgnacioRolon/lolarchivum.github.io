Much like how Nasus&#039; was updated when Azir was released.\r\n\r\nSo if you don&#039;t do it now, you may find it very hard to find cause in the future.\r\n\r\nKassadin is one of the few assassins I truly love. Unlike many others, his play style functions.. well.. how you&#039;d expect an assassin&#039;s would! He goes ham on one person, deletes them, and then gets the fuck out, and is less useful for a while afterwards. He doesn&#039;t jump in, mash his AoE, then turn into a fighter and duel the survivors, like many of the others do.  Unfortunately for such an awesome play style, playing him feels a bit like a stuck record sometimes:\r\n\r\n&quot;On my way.&quot;\r\n&quot;You are null and Void.&quot;\r\n&quot;Your magic is powerless against me.&quot;\r\n&quot;On my way.&quot;\r\n&quot;You are null and Void.&quot;\r\n&quot;Your magic is powerless against me.&quot;\r\n\r\nImo, he would definitely benefit from a new VO _(hopefully with Adam Harrington still, as his voice matches the character so well. and it would be nice especially after Riot outright insulted him and his work in a comment when Ryze was reworked)_.","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2018-03-04T23:38:02.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most likely his not.
