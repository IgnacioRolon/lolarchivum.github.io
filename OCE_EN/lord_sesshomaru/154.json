(serious discussion)","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"_(**Tl;DR** at the bottom, don&#039;t worry, I&#039;ve learned my lesson xD)_\n\n____\n\nThis is an issue that has cropped up over the last year and a half, and gets progressively more common.\nRather than balancing champions now, Riot just reworks them into a completely different spot, and hopes they hit the mark.\n\nThe whole point of &#039;balancing&#039; a champion is that you can tilt their power in one way or the other, but the distinction is that the changes are always _reversible_, the champion remains the same champion, and when the meta shifts, some of the removed power can be added back or vice versa.\n\nBut as it stands now, if a champion isn&#039;t performing well, or isnt interesting enough, rather than tweak numbers, they just scrap them and try again, to some extent.\n\nNow, this is understandable in the case of champions like Poppy and Yorick, Sion and Warwick etc. Because these are not &#039;balance&#039; changes. Those champions were changed because they had been around since the dawn of time, they visually belonged to a game that almost doesn&#039;t exist anymore, and their presence dragged the quality of the game as a whole down a notch, because their quality was substantially lacking.\n\nBut:\nAatrox\nAkali\nAlistar\nAmumu\nAnivia\nAshe\nBrand\nCaitlin\nCassiopeia\nCho&#039;Gath\nCoki\nDarius\nFizz\nGaren\nGraves\nKatarina\nKog&#039;Maw\nLeBlanc\nMalzahar\nMaokai\nMordekaiser\nQuinn\nRammus (upcoming)\nRengar\nSejuani\nShaco\nShyvana\nSkarner\nSona\nTalon\nVeigar\nVel&#039;Koz\nVladimir\nXerath\nZac\nZed\nZiggs\nZyra\n\nWere not all _essential_ updates.\nAdmittedly, some changes like LeBlanc, Ryze, and Talon, were undoubtably a step forward, from champions that was notoriously hard to balance, and I have no problem with champions like them receiving an update _(after serious consideration forom Riot and the Community)._ Some updates like Graves and Caitlin, while not _essential_ did a good job at creating a larger variety of champions to fit different niches, and the interest factor of the game is better off with the updates than without them.\nBut other changes like Brand _(which 100% was not needed, and 100% made things worse)_ and Fizz are just nothing more than vein attempts to draw attention to champions to increase public interest.\n\nThe first batch of &#039;balance&#039; updates (The Juggernauts) was new and exiting, it had everyone hyped, it was the first thing of its kind, no one knew what to expect, and everyone likes new and shiny things. There were a few Darius and co. players who were unnerved about their favourite champions being changed, _(after all some of them had paid money for those champions, and now the thing they paid for, was being changed to something different)._ But no one really saw this as a problem. After all, it&#039;s not like it happened every day! Updating champions was a very rare occurrence.\n\nBut then it happened again, the Marksmen had their turn in the limelight, this time it was a much larger update, and some of the changes completely turned the playstyles of the champions on their heads. But again, everyone was so blown away with the new and wildly exciting new abilities each of the ADC&#039;s now had. (in my opinion, the Marksmen update was the only class update that was actually desperately needed for game health)\n\nBut after you&#039;ve updated this many champions, it becomes a slippery slope. Once the line has been crossed, and purchased content can be changed like this, it becomes easier to do it again and again. And thats exactly what happened, updates became more and more regular, and less and less necessary. They stopped being Graves level updates that took an existing champion that was no different to others like Lucian, and wrought a new exiting angle from it, and started just slapping fun quirky &#039;extras&#039; on existing champions _(that weren&#039;t even in a bad spot)_, for no real reason. Brand, Vel&#039;Koz, Shaco, Zed etc were all victims of this. \nEventually, updates started coming out that weren&#039;t even attached to a Class update, it was just out of the blue, BAM! all of a sudden, Shyvana, Cho&#039;Gath, Aatrox are different. No warning, little context. There they were. Suddenly no champion was safe.\n\n________\n\nNow that is all fine, old champions need a little &#039;spice&#039; sometimes, I&#039;m not disputing that.\nBut coming back to my previous point, now the balance changes to champions have moved from _reversible_ to _irreversible_. Now that Brand HAS AoE explosions, when the meta shifts again and Brand is too strong, you can&#039;t just take them away again, like you could with number tweaks.\n\nWe have seen this already with Kog&#039;Maw, his spur-of-the-moment, quirky update became a little too difficult to balance. Riot is left with no choice but to take it away again. And now Kog is a shell of a champion, he isn&#039;t quite the same as he _used_ to be, and is merely a shadow of what he _can_ be, and no one really knows what he is supposed to do anymore.\nHe will inevitably get another update in future that will take him in yet another direction, and further confuse Kog mains.\n\n**My point, and the whole point of this post.**\n\nIs asking: Is this what we want for our game?\nDo we really want champions to be juggled, &#039;renewed&#039; and &#039;reverted&#039; just for balance sake? Some of these updates, like Sejuani&#039;s passive, are not built for longevity, there will come a time in the meta where 1000 armour just isn&#039;t acceptable, and she will need to be partly changed or reverted again.\nMalzahar is experiencing this atm, he has already had several mini-updates, constantly changing how his minions work, constantly not quite getting it right.\n\nPersonally, I like the idea that once a champion is released, for the most part, that is them! You can purchase them, learn them, play them. All safe in the knowledge that if you come back next year, that same champion will be waiting.\nI dont like the idea that one day, all the champions I love could be completely different. What if I no longer like those champs? Hundreds of thousands of mastery points become meaningless, purchased skins stop being used..\n\nObviously, champions that are real problems, and can&#039;t be balanced through any other means _(Like LeBlanc and Ryze)_ have to be updated in order to keep the game healthy, but Updating someone should be a last resort!. Changing a champion around every now and then, purely to rotate interest in them, or becasue they weren&#039;t as popular as you&#039;d hope. Isnt something that I can stand behind.\n\nAurelion Sol for example, wasn&#039;t even out a year before Riot announced that he hadn&#039;t &#039;hit the mark&#039; they were expecting for the long anticipated release of Ao Shin, and had decided to update him at their nearest convenience, _(he hasn&#039;t even lived through one full season yet, give the poor guy a chance!)_\n\nIt is a game that is alive and constantly evolving it&#039;s true, and thats one of the great things about the game! But there does need to be some form of consistency, and I personally think that the champions people identify with and love, should remain a rock! By all means change the Jungle and the items and the towers and the dragons. But don&#039;t change champions to fit an item, change the Item to fit the champion. Don&#039;t update champions to work better in the jungle, update the jungle to better accomodate the champions.\n\nIn my opinion: You don&#039;t change Batman and give him a bow and arrow, just because Archery is &#039;the popular thing&#039; atm, and you want to keep Batman&#039;s popularity high. You leave Batman being Batman, just like you leave Green Arrow being Green Arrow. One day Arrow is popular, and Batman less so. Later on, Batman is the hot thing and Green Arrow&#039;s popularity takes a dive. The same should be true of champions, If Aatrox isn&#039;t the hottest thing on the block, don&#039;t force him to be different, let Cait and Jhin have their moment in the sun, maybe next year Aatrox becomes the new hip thing.\n________\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis is 100% my own view, I have no idea how many people share it or oppose it.\nIm not a Rioter, I don&#039;t have access to information that sheds light on how these updates have affected the game, or how well received they are.\nThis is just my own feelings and observations.\n\nI would love to know what you guys think about tweaking vs updating. _(props to anyone who actually read this btw)_, Rioters welcome too of course!\n_______\n-\n______\n**TL;DR:** \nUpdating a champion _(complete Sion-level reworks excluded)_ has slowly just become another way of &#039;balancing&#039; them, with some updates clearly just being flashy publicity stunts. This means that any champion can be updated _(and/or reverted as shown by the case of Kog&#039;Maw)_ at any time, just for the sake of current balance, and popularity. \n\nI personally think champions should be a rock. They remain roughly the same for their life, only being updated as a complete last resort. I, just like everyone else, think that updates are new and fun, but recently Riot is going update-happy just because it&#039;s popular and gets the blood pumping for players in the heat of the moment, and I fear for the long-term implications this may have, both for balance and for the level stability that we as humans like to have. \n_&quot;Don&#039;t fix what ain&#039;t broke&quot;_ in other words.\n\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-05-09T23:27:59.585+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"tl;dr.

Darius is no more or less of an axe wielding manic than before. Its these kind of updates, purely for balance or popularity reasons that I have issue with.\n\nTalon, LB, Ryze, Graves, all had meaning. and like you said, solidified who that champ was supposed to be and they were great!\nBut Brand's had no meaning, Amumu's has no meaning, they were just publicity stunts.\nThats what I don't like :(","replies":[{"poster":"Ceness","date":"2017-05-11T05:37:10.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not too sure on this but I think that the reason for the Darius and Vlad ones (and Fizz to an extent, even though he is an assassin) was to give them more sustained damage rather than burst. Especially on Vlad's old E when you would just stack it walking to lane and then one hit the opponent if they were a squishy because of the stacks. Not too sure about the Darius passive change but it did slightly change the playstyle, and then made it a lot easier to go on Guillotining sprees (which are fun).\nThey did also eventually make his ult a lot less forgiving after they made it too forgiving, which is nice at the moment, not so nice when you were way out of the range and it still hit you.\n\nI guess they're also trying to get them in line with what they perceive the consumers to want. If you wanna go back to the Batman analogies think 60's Adam West's campy Batman when compared to modern day interpretations. They have changed Batman, they've brought him in line with what the consumers want from him, not all changes are good (e.g. BatNipples), and not everyone likes the changes but you at least have to try.\n\nIn terms of tweaking versus updating, I'm pretty on the fence. Occasionally I look at a champ they're updating and think that this is the absolute worst thing they could have done, but then I remember I'm not a game designer and they probably know (at least I hope) what they're doing. When they changed Quinn I was so annoyed just because she was one of the very first champions I played, but now I think it's an OK change, not the best, probably made her a lot healthier for the game too. I still prefer the old Quinn but the new one isn't as bad as I thought it would be. A lot of those small changes may seem pretty bad but you get used to them (except for the fact they've absolutely gutted Shyv on anything but SR, and even then you're only good when you're ahead in drags). Anyway, I got sidetracked there, tweaking in a way just hides the problem and if something changes it just comes right back, now if they get the update right it should theoretically go away and in many cases it has but it's the ones where it doesn't that stands out to the community.\n    last paragraph tl;dr: Meh","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-11T06:17:48.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can give sustained damage without updating them, buff their tankiness a bit, nerf the damage per ability, and give them less cooldowns on the abilities. At least worth giving a shot before scrapping them and redoing it.\n\n> easier to go on Guillotining sprees (which are fun).\n\nThats a matter of perspective.. I can think of 5 people in that situation that find it the polar-opposite of fun!\n1 fun VS 5 not-funs.. I consider that somewhat unsuccessful in my books. :S\n\nThat's fair with what you say about Batman, but those were largely aesthetic changes, he still uses baterangs, the batmobile and grappling guns. It was more of a Karthus level re-work (visual), than a Caitlin one (functional).\n\nand definitely the game needs to change with the times, don't get me wrong! \nBut you don't go around burning and erasing all the old tapes of Adam West, and replacing them with Christian Bale and Ben Affleck. Because there are people who grew up with that and identify more with that than the more modern ones.\nTheres room for both. \n\nBut I'm not a game designer either (as much as I wish I was), so I cant really say what the right move is.\n\nIt's true that tweaking champs does just temporarily hide the problems, and than in theory, a 'good' update should never have to be tweaked. But Riot forcibly changes the meta at least once (Often twice) a year, so then once the meta is changed, even the updated champs need tweaking and we are back at square 1 again.\n\nBut yea, I suppose its just a perspective thing, i guess it matters how attached you are to a champion. If you constantly move between champs, its not really a problem. But if you live and breathe a select few, updates can be a nightmare.","replies":[{"poster":"Ceness","date":"2017-05-11T07:47:33.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as the Batman thing goes, I'm not very knowledgeable on the subject, but I don't believe that you can just throw an Adam West styled Batman in a current movie and give him a brand spanking new CGI suit and equipment, he would just be out of place because of the time difference. Back when that Batman came out the target audience was for a kinda corny superhero, but that has changed to a much more dark, gritty atmosphere and as such he had to change with it. Unfortunately you sometimes just have to go with the flow as you might belong to a minority who prefers that kinda stuff over the new, which now has no big market.\nIt's like early film techniques, you go back and watch some of those now and it just looks super cringey, not even the nostalgia can hide that fact. If you tried incorporating some of those into a modern movie there would be some people who would enjoy it, but the majority would not. (Just so you know I'm not talking about Batman here, just fyi, I was meaning kinda older things where every line it would cut to the next character speaking and just show their face, just kinda awkward, sorry I can't find any examples here. Just think of student films and the like where it is actually a close-up everytime). Or for a possibly better example compare the old Star Trek shaking scenes with similar ones in movies and TV shows today, not that that's a very good one, or perhaps try fight scenes.\nWhat that overly long passage was trying to say is that sometimes things are products of the times, they may still be good, but eventually they may need to be phased out or greatly updated.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2017-05-10T04:22:05.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually was wondering why Riot was throwing out reworks when it wasn't even Mid/Pre-Season.
