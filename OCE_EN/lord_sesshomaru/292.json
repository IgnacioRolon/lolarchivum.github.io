To name a few I remember, Aether Wing Kayle up, Malphite up, and Kalista down. They're basically going through and equalising them all so that the human champs are all roughly the same size, monster champs that are supposed ot be big like malp/cho  are bigger etc etc (all within the balance confines they have of course as model size affects how big they can make the hitboxes)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wasuwo","date":"2015-11-25T05:46:28.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"noticed it as well, same thing with udyr","replies":[]}]}
