Really?.. I don&#039;t think you have even listened at all to what people say about Zed. \r\nZed **SHOULD** be able to 100% - 0% you, all assassins should, it&#039;s their job. I don&#039;t think many people dispute that... \r\nWhat we complain about is why while he is doing that, he has enough AoE to debilitate the 2 people around you who are trying to help you, and then gets away scott free afterwards.\r\n\r\nWhy do any assassins have AoE to begin with? Their job is to jump in, kill their target, and jump out. How does that require excess amounts of AoE?\r\nThey&#039;re &#039;assassins&#039; they assassinate people, they make picks before fights begin, or sneak past the font line during fights to take out the backline, they shouldn&#039;t be such a threat to the team as a whole during fights. THATS the kind of thing pope find frustrating, not that they 100-0 you.\r\n\r\nYou wouldn&#039;t expect Ezio to run into a building swinging a giant battle axe around, screaming his head off. You&#039;d expect him to sneakily scale the walls, drop down behind the target, stab him in the back, then disappear into the night. \r\n\r\nYou wouldn&#039;t expect Agent 47 to drive a hummer down the street duel wielding AK-47&#039;s to kill his target. You expect him to sneak around with a silenced pistol subtly taking out guards.\r\n\r\nSo why does Kat suddenly appear in the middle of a team throwing knives literally everywhere with no aiming at all\r\nWhy does Zed throw shuriken in all directions damaging everyone in sight, while he and all his shadows are lethal to go near becasue they are swirling with Shadow Slash stuff.\r\n\r\nWhy should league assassins not represent any of what we consider &#039;assassin&#039; play styles.\r\n\r\nThats what we find annoying with Zed, not the fact he can kill you...","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-02-09T01:22:24.667+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree in part. I mean assassins do have to have some value in teamfights, and I'd argue that whilst it's frustrating when Katarina is fed, she does need to look for an opportunity to use her ult, or just get cc'd down (the upfront damage of a fed katarina, makes this decision rather negligible though).\n\nPersonally I think Assassins should have a better distinction of 'assassin' than fighter. Some assassin abilities give a very 'assassin' esque feel, whereas others feel kind of generic fighter or mage type. Also I feel the isolated mechanic is a very good mechanics for assassins, and whilst it is Kha'zix's unique mechanic, I feel an assassin item with a similar bonus for picking off enemies when they decide to wander around alone would help improve the 'uniqueness' of assassins.\n\nAssassins players should have to think like assassins. Patient. careful, cunning, looking to isolate their target from the herd, thinking how to get in and get out, and not looking for a clean honest fight, but more either a jumpscare or luring you into a trap or appearing behind you at a moment that couldn't be worse for you, and assuring your death.\n\nCurrently alot of assassins are roam, look for picks, try to snowball, and then devolve into a more mobile version of a fighter or mage. When you see where a Zed positions in both high and low elo teamfights, he's rarely off to the side, out of vision, no, rather he just stands in the middle line just behind the tanks like a typical mage.\n\nI feel the best way to see if an assassin is truly an assassin is where they position when teamfights happen. Are they trying to get the element of surprise? make a pick? are they trying to sneak behind and look for a target or two whilst the tanks aren't paying attention? If the answer is no, then that's not an assassin.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-02-09T04:10:18.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I couldn't agree more.\n\nKha feels like an assassin, he stalks the jungle looking for prey, he doesn't hop-skip-and-jump into the middle of a fight, spam his AoE then just ignite the one with lowest HP like Fizz does.\n\nTalon is the same, he stalks around looking to surprise people, yes he has AoE but it's more for the purpose of stacking his passive than anything else, it doesn't half health you like Fizz or Kats AoE\n\nI think that if an assassin catches you out, unless you're a tank, there should be very little you can do! However if an assassin junps on you while your allies are next to you, I think there should be very little the assassin can do.\n\nAs it is now, Zed and Fizz etc aren't punished at all for jumping on a group. How is that assassin behaviour?\n\nThere needs to be a bigger distinction between assassins and fighters.\nAssassins should in theory be 100% useless in a prolonged battle, but deadly lethal in short skirmishes.... tell that to Yasuo!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-09T06:11:28.085+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Whatever you're problems with balance, you seem to have very much misinterpreted what was said in that post.\n\n> And we definitely shouldn't talk about what frustrates us about champions, becasue thats just vague and annoying for you?\n\nVague as in unhelpful, not vague as in annoying... Saying you don't like to verse Zoe is as meaningless to a balance as saying you like cake. Sure they can guess from that it's probably you like the sponginess of that chocolate cake you just ate, but it could just as easily be the icing, or the chocolate flavour, or the all around experience, so it doesn't really help them make a cake you like at all.\n\nThey're talking about a general population, as in a bunch of random people complaining about Zoe. The people that put thought into exactly why are by far the minority in that group.\n\n>All of the above impact your perception of a champion, but not all of them are indicative of a problem.\n\nI hate Blitz, doesn't mean he's OP. I hate supporting Ezreals, doesn't mean he's bad to support. The point was perception is a very narrow metric to base balance on. They have to take more than just how a small portion of the populace *feels* about a champion.\n\n> [The] response to the perception that “Zed is frustrating” should not just be to nerf him.\n\nWould you actually want this? They nerf Zed, Yas and Zoe because some people find them frustrating, great. But I find Azir frustrating to verse, and I'm sure I'm not alone, should we nerf him too? Should we nerf Cassio? Should we nerf Janna?\n\n> what’s an issue in Brazil in low MMR might not be an issue in Vietnam\n\nShould we balance by region and destroy the international Esports scene? Should NA just be the priority because that's the central region? Or maybe KR because it's considered to be the best?\n\n___\n\n\nYou can't please everyone, it's simply impossible. So the obvious solution is to please as many people over as wide a demographic as possible right. Remember that places like boards or reddit attract those players that have a problem with something. \n\nPeople rarely come to post along the lines of \"I really like the way you balanced Malphite this patch great job guys\", because what's the point.

I haven't seen any posts that are just:\n\"Hi, I don't like hecarim, goodbye.\" \n\n--------------------------\n\nOf course you don't just nerf champs because of a few people saying they don't like them. But usually it's not just a few people is it. Yasuo/Zed/Zoe are permabanned in many elos, and you always hear people complaining about them in the games they are in.\n\nNow I'm fine with Azir or Janna or Cass being nerfed if that's what the population want, but I think you'll find that the numbers of people who want Yasuo nerfed are vastly superior to the number of people who want Cass nerfed.\n\n--------------------------\n\nPersonally I couldn't care less about Esports, all that does is fill my games with players thinking they can be pros just by being sheep and playing Olaf mid or Ezreal jungle or whatever. However I am a minority in the opinion so therefore I'm not a person who should be highly listened to when it comes to that genre.\n\nNo I don't think that we should balance by region, however I think NA and EU should have a bigger sway over balance than smaller servers such as OCE.\nAnd I'd like to see Riots stats on how the different Elo's of each server compare, because I doubt that NA bronze will have huge problems with Yasuo and EU bronze will have no problem at all.\n\n\n---------------------\n\n\nNo you can't please everyone, so, why don't we put more emphasis on where the majority of people are (bronze/silver/gold) and less on the extreme low and extreme high elos.","replies":[{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2018-02-09T08:44:45.346+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"because most low elo balance problems are fixed by getting gud while high elo blaance problems are where the real over powered picks are","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-02-09T11:07:44.124+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"You're working on the assumption that low elo is bad and high elo is good.

Balancing globally doesn't work anyway. 90% of players are gold and below, yet if you balance globally, they have just as much sway over the balance as plat+ which has under 10% of the population.\n\nThey balance 'globally' in relation to the segregation of ranks, not the segregation of players. And global balance causes issues like we discussed before with Trynd and Yi where they steamroll low elo and don't get played at all in high elo.
