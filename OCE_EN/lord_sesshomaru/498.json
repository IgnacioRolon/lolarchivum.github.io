However with the removal of flask and the stupid &#039;only 1 type of potion&#039; rule you cant do that anymore as 3 charges of the corruption flask isn&#039;t enough sustain, and the passive damage of the corruption flask just pressures you to play aggressive, which a lot of people (like me when i play kha) don&#039;t like to do so early on its the same if you are playing against a massive counter, you don&#039;t want to go all in with nothing but a flask, please give us that sustain option please, that because you only have potions it weakens your duelling potential but gives you that play safe option.\r\n\r\nKha\r\nGP\r\nSinged\r\nare just some of many champs deeply affected by this\r\n\r\nkha and GP cant just play safe and farm anymore and singed loses wayyy too much of his sustain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njust remove the only 1 type of potions rule, by all means have a only 1 type of flask rule but please let us have potions again.\r\nits hard enough without mana ones but now we have to go without health ones too :/","replies":[]}
