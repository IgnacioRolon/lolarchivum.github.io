They all just seem longer than they did last season.\r\n\r\n\r\nis it just me? or is it because everyone is dealing more damage quicker? or is there another reason?","replies":[{"poster":"LostMind","date":"2015-12-28T10:35:02.662+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Burst damage is in a really highpoint in LoL right now.\nI've been saying it for ages, but landing CC wins teamfights, now it's even more true.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-12-28T10:59:46.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably Thunderlords and new items, a lot of new items have damage attached also Thunderlords is op atm so you get hit by one stun then the normal damage plus all the preseason damage things","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-27T12:14:12.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">is it because of all the bs masteries and new damage/crit items or something?\nis everyone just doing more damage which makes the CC feel like it lasts longer or something?\n\nThere are several reasons that come into this and i will list them in order of how relevant they are to why this has happened.\n\nMastery: Thunderlords, this is just annoying, and when 2/3 hit you in a row, your health bar is gone.\nLess tanks, they made tank AD items stronger, and people are still too retarded to actually get hybrid tank/ad items on AD champs.\nHybrid tank items are lacking in terms of armor, and AD items make itemizing straight AD extremely easy, leading to death by about 2-3 autos, which is about how long you last in a leona ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WhiteKimchi","date":"2015-12-27T11:09:27.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thunderlords x5","replies":[]}]}
