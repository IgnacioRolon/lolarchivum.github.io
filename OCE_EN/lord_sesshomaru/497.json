Which means if the enemy jungler beats her to it at 2:05 mins _(which is a 50/50 chance they do, and a 90% chance they are stronger than her early game, and can just fight her off if she does get there first anyway.)_ Her next mark will _only_ spawn on the next scuttle crab.\r\n\r\n**In simple terms:** If the enemy jungler prioritises always getting scuttle _(which even a braindead vegetable will do, considering its importance both as a mark and an objective)_. Her marks will _never_ spawn on any other creatures.  \r\n\r\nMeaning all the enemy jungler ever has to do is get that first scuttle crab. and it makes her mark timer effectively 150 seconds. So changing it to 40 seconds from 50 does virtually nothing, because it&#039;s going to be at 150 anyway _(more than 3 times longer what you changed it to)_.\r\n\r\nSo if kindred doesn&#039;t manage to get the first scuttle, she cant get a shot at her next mark until past the 4 minute mark. And even then, all the enemy has to do is get there before her again, to prolong her marks by another 150 seconds. Now for a champion based entirely around said marks, as you can imagine, it kinda sets her back more than a little bit.\r\n\r\nThe only way to break the scuttle crab cycle is to get a mark from a champion instead. But the whole point of having jungle marks for her to chase in early game, is because her early game ganks are cringeworthy at the best of times, and she can&#039;t get those lane marks without the laner basically spoon-feeding them to her, because they have to provide both the CC and damage she lacks.\r\n\r\n_[And lets not forget that it takes pretty much 30 seconds to recall and return to the river too. Which means even if you do get the first scuttle crab and get your 40 sec timer. Every time you get a mark and have to recall _(becasue you&#039;ve had Yi on your tail all the way through his jungle, and only escaped by the skin of your teeth)_, by the time you have regained your HP and are back in the jungle again, your next mark is up and you have to go on another little suicide mission. It doesnt allow any time for farming at all.]_\r\n\r\nIf she doesn&#039;t get her marks, everything suffers. Her dueling, her wave-clear, her gank potential. EVERYTHING.\r\nI&#039;m sorry but 150 second mark spawn times _(where the enemy knows exactly where it will spawn too)_ just wont cut it.\r\n\r\nLike come on, its your job to know this shit.\r\n_____________________\r\n\r\nYou **need** to rework/revert that champion. \r\nHer update was terrible. Absolutely awful.\r\n\r\nI love that champ so much, everything about them is so cool. And I genuinely feel like smashing my head into a wall every time I play her.\r\n\r\nIts so frustrating. Grrrrrrrr!\r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-shisa}}","replies":[]}
