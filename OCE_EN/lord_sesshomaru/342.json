Also, Valor is an animal and is still blocked by the ability (come on Rito).\n\nAs for Maokai's Saplings, the ability states nothing in regards to plants and, while they could be considered in the same category as animals in the sense they are living beings, they're still not animals. And as for Janna's wind elemental, there's not much clarity on how exactly Riot defines them. Are they a form of magical animal or are they non-biological altogether?\n\nThat said, what about abilities that use body parts of champions (specifically, champions which are defined as animals in one way or another), such as Tahm Kench's Tongue Lash?\n\nAnd if we were to include plants would that mean all of Zyra's abilities would be immune to wind walls and spell shields?\n\nThere is little consistency with this ability description amongst the rest of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-12-21T09:55:05.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are right about Azir they are animals, although they are technically necromancy summonings, (so at least 'used' to be animals) so I'm not sure if that affects the process.\n\nTrue about Maokai, although the saplings are indeed blocked by the wall during flight, and seeming they are neither animal (because they are plants) or projectile (because they are living beings) there must be is something missing in the description that prevents flying non-projectile plants from passing through the wall.\n\nTrue about Janna, information is lacking, but seeming it is a self propelled organism it cant be a 'projectile' yet it is blocked by the wall that blocks 'projectiles' so therefore something must be amiss.\n\nAs for body parts, as long as it is still connected to the original e.g.  Blitz pull, Tahm Q, Thresh Hook. it technically isn't a projectile so therefore they should pass through the wall, but they don't. which confuses me.\n\nAs for Zyra's plants, Her spitting plants couldnt spit through the wall because plant matter or not the bolts are still non-living non-connected projectiles. However her snaring Roots should indeed pass through the wall because they are living organisms and are not only self propelled but travel along the ground so therefore they cant be classed as projectile under any means, and so therefore shouldn't be blocked.\n\nYou raise some good points!","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-12-21T10:09:42.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> You are right about Azir they are animals, although they are technically necromancy summonings, (so at least 'used' to be animals) so I'm not sure if that affects the process.\n\nStill animals though, just dead (or, rather, undead).","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-12-21T11:45:42.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True this is!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-22T04:20:43.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and are any of those summoner spells?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-12-22T08:17:20.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The description gives the reason that Poros are animals, not that they are summoner spells, as to why they ignore spell shields and wind walls.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-22T09:18:38.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my justification.
