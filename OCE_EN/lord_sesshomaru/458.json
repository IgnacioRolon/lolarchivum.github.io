So i failed to click on it to read this _vital_ piece of information (which is not advertised anywhere else, in any way) \r\n\r\nso there goes 3 long stressful hours of my life cursing myself for every single death, wasted... all i want is mastery 7 tokens for Azir, but he&#039;s so popular atm that the S scores are so damn high, (even my 11/1/20 game at 13 mins only got me an A or A-) and now i find out that even if i did get an S, i wouldn&#039;t even get any tokens for it. \r\n\r\nThats my stupid mistake (yea I&#039;m dumb i know), anyway I&#039;m posting a warning here (where people can actually see it) so that no one else wastes their time. \r\n\r\nTo RIOT: If you don&#039;t think that rotating game modes test your &#039;champion mastery&#039; skill enough, then don&#039;t have any mastery-related rewards (like TT and ARAM), and if you do think you should earn mastery points, then it should have ALL mastery related rewards. You cant give some and not others, wheres the logic in that.\r\n\r\nOh well, back to the dreadful 50 minute each 5v5 slog with a damn Zed in every game... \r\n\r\nthe things we do for our fave champions... :&#039;(","replies":[{"poster":"Neuzz","date":"2016-07-11T15:28:56.571+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its disappointing for ppl like me, who play only arams and speecial modes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-06-03T12:03:52.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Rotating modes shouldn't give the tokens, in my opinion. Given the nature of featured game modes, it can be significantly easier to earn higher ranks meaning that the skill required to earn them is effectively \"reduced\", so why should they grant access to mastery ranks that are *supposed* to indicate a higher level of skill as \"opposed to\" (I can't think of anything better to put here, honestly) mastery ranks that can be earned by anyone and everyone?\n\nLevels 1-5 of the mastery system were never there to indicate skill, rather they're there to indicate that a player has played X champions across several dozen (or so) matches. Levels 6+, however, have a skill component to them and, as such, should *rightfully* be treated differently in situations that would make it \"too easy\" to earn them.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-03T18:54:02.333+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your points are fair but, playing a champion in any game mode well still requires knowledge and skill with that champion, because each game mode has pros and cons, the pro of aram is yes you do get lots of kills, but the con is you also get lots more deaths, and deaths found more than kills in champion mastery. \n\nYou could be very good at Syndra for example, and you could be really good at keeping your distance from everyone and poking them down before you go in, but when you play TT Hexakill, you need to play in a cramped environment which tests your skill with that champion in a different way. \n\nPoro king tests your Siege \n\nHexakill tests your Awareness (having to keep track of all 12 champions when they're all right next to you) and your ability to get kills.\n\n- Ascension tests your Roam and teamwork (if you usually play a champ like Azir/Heim you may be very good at holding one position and sieging, but this game will force you out of that strategy and forcibly test you in constant mobility and map awareness)\n\n- One for all tests your in depth knowledge of a champion, you have to be aware of what everyone is building and know how that will change the way that champion plays, and how to best co-ordinate your own play to best augment that, (for example if you're all going Xin, instead of going 5 AD Xin's, you will have to adjust your gameplay and build him tank or AP) which means you have to know everything about your champ and how they will react to this. \n\n- Doombots tests strategy, i don't know of anyone who won doombots 5 just by running in, team fighting, and then pushing, like you do in normal 5's. It was all about grouping when you needed to and separating when you need to, about the whole team quickly running in, assassinating 1 bot and then running out. You had to decide wether to abandon defence and go on a split pushing crusade, or wether to turtle up and capitalise on any mistakes. \n\n- Black market brawlers tests your objective focus, are you going to win by focusing on getting kills and stocking up on the shark-rat things? Are you going to value siege over kills and make sure to arm your tower destroying minions, do you value map control/awareness, buying the vision critters and keeping a tight hold of dragon, baron, herald, crab, and watching for ganks? \n\n- Urf just straight out tests your awareness, reaction times, and performance under pressure. \n\nSo while not the same as 5v5, all the game modes are a lot more than just 'fun on a stick' they all test certain skills (some of which are rarely tested in 5's) and they test it in a 'trial by fire' fashion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-06-03T13:27:40.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"yeah you can't get them in aram , you dont get any mastery points gained in that mode,period. the legend of the poroking is an aram based mode.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-03T18:25:28.730+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rotating game modes (including the poro king) still ive you mastery points and chests, even if its on the aram map, just not the 6/7 tokens.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-06-03T11:07:19.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"its only summoners rift that you can get lvl 6 and 7 tokens....... did u not know this lol","replies":[]}]}
