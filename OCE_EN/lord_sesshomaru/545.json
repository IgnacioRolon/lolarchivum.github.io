OR maybe... \njust maybe, its because you gave his kit _literally_ EVERYTHING.\n\n________\n\nYou look at the champions that are popular here, and its easy to see the theme:\nYasuo\nKayn\nLee\nRiven\nRakan\nZed\nFizz\nKha\nVayne\netc.\n\nIt&#039;s the champs that just have more than everyone else, DPS/burst/escapes/engages/CC/Utility most of them have it all.\nand then you look at the ones that are unpopular:\nNunu\nKarthus\nSol\nLissandra\nDr Mundo\nMordekaiser\nXerath\nEtc.\n\nbehold the champs that just have less. \nThey have a lot of what they do have, but they just have less variety of mechanics in their kit.\nWhy play Karthus and have access to good sustained damage and a slow, when you can play Yasuo and have both sustained and burst damage, coupled with ranged CC, massive utility, and all the mobility in the world.\nIt&#039;s not rocket science. _&quot;Do I want 2 lollies, or 20?&quot;_\n\nIm not saying the unpopular champs aren&#039;t good, quite the opposite, Id argue that champs with access to less stuff, but specialise in those things, are a much healthier approach to the game than a cage-fight between two titans like Riven and Lee.\n\nBut please don&#039;t pretend like you don&#039;t know why champions are popular. Find me one game _(or movie, or anything)_ where the &#039;Cool Loner Samurai Master with a dark past&#039; is the least liked character. and find me one game where the bloated ugly as heck void monster is the most adored addition to the roster.\n\nBefore a champ even debuts, even I have pretty good idea wether they will be popular or not, so I damn well hope you do.\n\n_________________\n\n> but the only thing we don&rsquo;t want to do is make a champion who ends up being unpopular\n\n\n\nBy very definition, not every champ can be popular. and thats okay!\nEveryone is different, and so if a group really likes one thing, it&#039;s pretty much a certainty that someone else, somewhere, is going to happen to like the opposite.\n\nSo saying _&quot;We never want any champ to be unpopular!&quot;_ is a massive middle finger to those people, it basically says _&quot;If you don&#039;t like Yasuo, you don&#039;t deserve to have a champ you do like!&quot;_\n\n&#039;Unpopular&#039; means not many play them, but &#039;not many&#039; is NOT &#039;no one&#039;.\nSo when you have that attitude of _&quot;If they are unpopular, somethings wrong! better change them.&quot;_ it screws over the people who do infact really like that champ, and are they any less deserving of a champ they enjoy, just because there happens to be not many of them?\n\nWhy is there the need to make unpopular champs popular?\nThe popular crowd already has Yasuo and Lee and Vayne etc, why is there the need to also force Karthus _(for a hypothetical example)_ away from the current players and into a sphere that is already crowded with popular champs. Why not keep some champs like Karthus and Sol for the crowd that happens to not like the play style that makes champions popular?\n\nThere are enough champions for everyone, and if in order to please everyone, some champs have to be less popular, then so be it, theres still a hundred other champs for people to choose from. Just accept that not all champs can be Elvis, but that doesnt mean they are any more or less important than Yasuo or Lee.\n\n_______________\n\nLets take Nunu for example. \nVery few people play Nunu, so lets rework him; change his kit, take everything he was and make it more appealing to the masses.\n\nNow the people who used to like Nunu, don&#039;t have access to the Nunu they like anymore, and the people who already had access to Yasuo, now have access to 56 popular champs instead of 55, except they wont even play Nunu, because they already play Yasuo. So all you&#039;ve done is take a champ away from those who enjoyed him for what he was, and given him to a crowd who doesn&#039;t really care because they already have what they want.\n\nSome people just don&#039;t like the formula/playstyle that usually makes champs popular.\nSo you&#039;re just giving options to those who already have lots of them, and taking options away from those who have few.\n\nSome people even like the unpopular champs purely because they are unpopular, maybe they don&#039;t like mirror lanes, or like the thrill of doing something different that people aren&#039;t used to. Why take that away from them by trying to make all champions as popular as possible.\n\n________________\n\n#TL;DR:\nIt&#039;s bloody obvious why some champs are more popular than others. Don&#039;t pretend it&#039;s some massive surprise that Lee Sin who has _everything_ is mysteriously more popular than Nunu who pretty much just has a slow.\nAnd it&#039;s perfectly fine to have unpopular champs, because not everyone likes the formula or playstyles that usually makes champs popular. So by having unpopular champs, there are more options for everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2017-11-19T06:43:49.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With all fairness, Azir belongs on that list as well.\n\nEDIT: You also forgot Camille and Fiora.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-11-19T08:08:13.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They were just examples to show my point, I wasn't going to list every champ.\nlots of other champs can be attributed to either list.\n\nThere are of course exceptions like Azir, who does have an awful lot in his kit but still manages to be unpopular. But I think that his unpopularity is attributed to how difficult he is relative to the reward you get from playing him.\n\nAzir no doubt has a higher potential impact on the game than a Fizz, but not by a huge amount.  The difference between the two is that even as an Azir main since day 1, I still can't utilise him to 100% of his potential, meanwhile pretty much anyone can play Fizz well while blindfolded. So naturally people go for the option that gives them the best reward possible for the most minimal effort.\n\nThe reverse is also true, there are champs that should in theory be unpopular, but find themselves on the other end of the scale like Miss Fortune.\n\nNo rule is absolute, especially in a game like league where there are countless variables, but as a general theme you can see why most popular champs are popular. \n\n**Generally its to do with strength and how easy it is to access that strength.**\nEven If you have nothing interesting in your kit, but can 1-hit people, then you become popular like Tryndamere. Meanwhile you can have a lot of stuff in your kit, but not have clearly visible strength, like Ivern, and instantly drop to the bottom of the pile.","replies":[]}]}]}
