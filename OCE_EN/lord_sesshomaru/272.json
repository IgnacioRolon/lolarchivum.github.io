Immediately afterwards the XP bar maxed out, and the free little legends at the end of the pass are gone _(the arrow to go forward is greyed out)_.  Missions are still up. \r\n\r\nDid I just happen to get enough points for the emote a split second before the pass ended.  _(I was not aware of any Riot posts signalling its impending end?)_ Or is something else happening here?  And why can't I scroll forward to see the prizes that haven't been claimed yet?\r\n\r\nAnyone wiser than I, please let me know what's happening.\r\nI'm less worried about the prizes themselves (the maps were what I was after), but I'm more concerned about why they were suddenly cut out. without _(to my eyes)_ any warning.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-12-31T10:03:01.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll pass this one on though it's already been posted a lot on NA. It's either yet another client bug to add to the long list of preseason drama, or there's been a lack of communication regarding the pass.\n\nI'm leaning towards bug, simply because they said: \"This one will stay up for the entire length of the Rise of the Elements set.\" and we haven't heard anything about the next set yet.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-12-31T13:12:17.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh ok thanks!\n\nYeah maybe itâ€™s a bug then.  \nPreseason is always drama haha","replies":[]}]}]}
