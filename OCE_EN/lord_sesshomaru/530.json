But when i saw the skin on skin spotlights on youtube i was impressed at how well the skin is made and how it fits so well with the eternum theme and then i saw the splash art which is almost if not as good as the nocturne one, \r\nseeming this new skin is not a legendary one i did expect it to de-value the Eternum theme and be just a cheapy version of noc's skin\r\nbut i was very wrong and the similarities between the two (while still maintaing the important differences) are really great, plus their map crossing ultimates both chill the blood a little when activated which is a cool theme to keep within the skin range.\r\nSo congratulations! you have fully restored my faith in quality sequels thank you :)\r\nand i am very keen for rek'sai now and i wasn't as much before i saw the skin so good work on selling it.\r\n\r\n(TLDR congrats on making two cool eternum skins)","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2014-12-09T07:55:57.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't wait till they remake Lollipoppy's theme on someone else","replies":[]},{"poster":"Area2609","date":"2014-12-08T16:12:37.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*clap clap clap :D","replies":[]}]}
