So this post is more of a discussion bringing him back to reality, and Dispelling some of the myths around him.\n\n**Myth 1: Aurelion Sol, created all the stars.**\nAurelion Sol is &#039;the star forger&#039;, but he didn&#039;t create all stars, as shown in Bard&#039;s cinematic where bard creates 3 new stars in a matter of seconds, And it is probable that the stars of the celestial aspects associated with Mt. Targon (The pantheon constellation etc etc) were not of his design either.\nHowever Aurelion Sol likely created the first star, shown by his a line in his lore: &quot;it was he who birthed light into the universe.&quot; (but this seems contradictory as he was born in the first breath of creation, and it would be near impossible for the big bang (or similar cosmic first breath) to occur without the release of light energy.)\n\n**Myth 2: Aurelion Sol is pretty much God.**\nAurelion Sol is powerful, but he isn&#039;t God nor omipotent. He views himself as a sort of God, but that does not make him one, he is stated to have equals in his lore, other celestial creatures that may or may not be identical to him. Showing that its entirely possible that he is one of a species instead of a singular entity (but his line &quot;there simply are no other dragons like me&quot; suggests that if this is the case, that dragons are not the only form they can take) but this fact is then reputed by his quote \"celestial dragons live and die by our own beautiful rules\" this suggests that he is in-fact part of a species and not a one-off entity. he is not all powerful either, he can be controlled by &#039;lesser&#039; beings. He also fought creatures that tore at the fabric of the universe, and clashes with other celestials similar to him, this implies (especially the latter) that he can be killed, if he was invulnerable then there would be no point &#039;clashing&#039; with other similar celestials because neither side would benefit.\n\n**Myth 3: Aurelion Sol is the oldest life-form.**\nHe is ancient to be sure, but its unlikely that he is the oldest, it states in his lore that there are other creatures he has known since the dawn of time, and if he has known them since the&#039;dawn of time,&#039; its likely that they entered the universe at the same time or before him.\nAlso we must consider Bard, Bard is by no means tied to runeterra or to this universe for that matter, almost nothing is known abut bard and because he is an interdimentional entity its highly possible that he pre-dates this universe and its creation. Also Kindred must be looked at, they are the physical incarnation of death, and while they make an appearance on runeterra it never states that they are exclusive to its surface, they could well be the embodiment of death for the entire universe (or all universes) its possible (even probable) that runeterra was the site of them splitting into two, but its also possible that the entity they were also pre-dates this universe (because as long as there is life, there must also be death, and kindred literally IS death.) Other interdimentional champions such as Nocturne and Fiddlesticks can be looked at (any interdimentional champion has the potential to pre-date Aurelion Sol) however both Nocture and Fiddlestick&#039;s lore is outdated and no longer canon (in other words we have no idea what they are or where they came from) and lastly but not least we cant forget the Void, another dimension shrouded in mystery that has untold life forms, some of which may easily be older and more powerful than Aurelion Sol. So Aurelion Sol may not even be the oldest champion, let alone the oldest life form.\n\n**Myth 4: Aurelion Sol is the most powerful champion.**\nThis is of course debatable on both sides, He is certainly powerful but other factors exist aside from power, Kindred for example is Death itself, and death comes to all things in the end, (except perhaps to kindred itself, as mentioned in their lore) so it is a certainty that in the end, even Aurelion Sol will fall to Kindred eventually (if not to someone else beforehand) even if it is at the end of time. Bard is another contender for most powerful, as aforementioned, almost nothing is known about Bard, but one line from his lore &quot;Bard steers all existence&quot; implies that he is far closer to being all-powerful than Aurelion Sol, (if not already being omnipotent) but apart from that one liner, Bard&#039;s power can only be speculated at, we know nothing of the limits or restrictions of his power, people think him weak because of his role as support, when its highly likely that he is one of if not the most powerful champion. \nother special case champions are Xerath, Azir, Renekton and Nasus, all are demi-gods but unlike the mortal incarnations of the Targon celestials (pantheon, Leona, Diana) they are immortal, and they do command the power of the sun (a star) inside them. Now more simple minded arguments would argue that &quot;Aurelion Sol made the stars, so one single star is no danger to him&quot; a simple analogy reveals the flaws in this statement: A single man can create 1000 blades in his life, but it only takes a slip with a single one to end the creator of all of them. This is further supported by Runeterra&#039;s star being one of the first created by Aurelion Sol and thus likely more powerful than others. (his lore also makes no mention of his ability to destroy stars, only his power to create them, otherwise he probably would have set about destroying the stars of the pantheon constellation etc) However his quotes to Azir, Renekton, and Nasus show that Aurelion Sol isn&#039;t afraid of the Ascension process, (however this may be a case of underestimating his opponent) and we do not know the limits of the power possessed by the 4 Ascended (it is never mentioned or even hinted at) also there is no reference that the Ascended can even be killed at all. When Xerath obtained his power, no attempt was made by Nasus or Renekton to try to Kill him (even though they were both ascended as well and it was a 2v1) they straight away tried to seal him away, this hints that it may indeed be possible that the Ascended cannot be killed and they know it, even by other beings powered by the Sun. The only mention of an Ascended ending is Azir&#039;s Taunt to Xerath: &quot;Xerath, its time your spark went out.&quot; If we are to take this literally, it must mean that Azir is (or believes himself to be) stronger not only than Xerath, but also stronger than Nasus and Renekton combined, which has the possibility of being true because Azir is the leader of the Ascended, but is unlikely for balance reasons. The most likely situation is that this taunt is exactly that, just a taunt, nothing more. Which brings us back to the possibility of the Ascended being un-killable (except at the end of the universe) if this is the case, then all 4 Ascended stand a chance (however small) at taking down Aurelion Sol (who has no implication of being un-killable) This chance would be similar to the analogy from Grimm&#039;s Fairytales of a little bird sharpening its beak on a mountain of diamond. It is also possible however that the Ascended can be Killed, in which case, Nasus, Renekton (and Probably Azir) wouldn&#039;t have much of a chance. Xerath however is a different story, it is a law of physics that energy can not be created or destroyed, (Xerath&#039;s energy was not created at his birth, it was taken from the power of the sun) and Xerath is a being of pure energy, so even after firing countless stars at Xerath, he may remain untouched, and even if Xerath&#039;s power barely scratches Aurelion Sol we can produce another analogy: An un-killable invulnerable man armed only with a feather, will inevitably and eventually overcome the largest army on earth armed to the teeth. \nSo we can conclude that Aurelion Sol has the possibility of being the most powerful champion, but it is far from being a certainty, and i (as an impartial observer) would think that Bard is more likely to be the most powerful champion, aided in no small way that he is the only aforementioned champ that has the possibility of escaping the end of the universe. \n\nMuch of what i have said relies on implications and informed speculation, but it serves to show people that Aurelion Sol is just another champ, the same as everyone else, and bring the expectations of him back down to reality.\n\nThis post is in no way &#039;anti-Aurelion Sol&#039; it just broadens a few minds to other champions, and dispels the single minded views of &quot;HOLY SHIT! HE MAKES STARS HE MUST BE GOD.&quot;\n\nIf you made it to the end of this post, i congratulate you! you&#039;re a true seeker of lore and truth. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2016-03-14T06:01:28.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you do understand what a myth is right?\nalso tl;dr","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-03-14T06:18:38.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, to re-phrase your comment:\n\"Do you understand what your own post is about? when i obviously do...

If he lives up to anything the hype proves him to be he'll be some form of dragon... and I _love_ dragons! I think it would be fun to play a champion who isn't a type of humanoid. It does feel like most of the champions are.
