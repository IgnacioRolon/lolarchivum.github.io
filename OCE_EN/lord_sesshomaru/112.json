For those of you who aren&#039;t bronze/silver, I will fill you in: \r\nEver since the world&#039;s finals, there has been a minimum of 2 Lee&#039;s in every game, it is legitimately a plague.\r\nand its beyond the point of a joke what this champion can do.\r\nThere are so many issues with him that I could point out, the fact that he has the 3rd highest movement speed in the game, AS WELL AS having such in-fight mobility for example. But I&#039;m not going to list them all. What I&#039;m going to talk about today is his damage. \r\n\r\n\r\n____________\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you think of Lee&#039;s ultimate, what comes to mind?\r\nFor myself, what comes to mind is Lee Sin ward hopping behind a champion and kicking them back int this waiting team, or kicking them forward into their own team creating a opportunity to engage or disrupt.\r\n\r\nNow think of an ultimate ability that&#039;s only purpose is just pure, straight damage! One that has no tactical purpose, and all you use it for is to pummel the enemy&#039;s health bar. The ability that comes to mind for me is Lux&#039;s Final Spark. When you think raw damage, that spell is pretty high up on the list.\r\nOf course, Lee is a fighter who often gets tank-like HP and resistances _(just look at his items in the picture)_ so he can survive long enough to make such interesting plays. While Lux is a squishy mid laner who needs damage just to keep herself alive _(you can see how she has built pretty much all damage items)_\r\n\r\n__________\r\n\r\n**So i ask you: How is it necessary that despite Lee&#039;s ultimate being a playmaking tool, and Lux&#039;s being a damage tool, that Lee sin&#039;s ultimate still does so much more damage?**\r\n\r\nBoth champions are full build _(or half an item off in Lux&#039;s case)_, Lee Sin has 2 full tank items, while Lux&#039;s least offensive item is Athenes. \r\nI was full build both times _(As Kalista)_ I was half HP when hit, not even by Lee&#039;s ult, but by someone else he had kicked and i was dead.\r\n\r\nHis Q dash also does way too much damage for an ability that cant be dodged, blocked, or evaded. \r\n\r\n**Lee Sin should be either an Assassin or a Tank, but certainly not both!**","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-11-10T03:46:39.075+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to Riot games balance, where I'm seriously considering if the majority of Riot employees are gold 5 or higher","replies":[]},{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-11-10T03:30:35.336+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zed, Yasuo, and Lee Sin will never be touched by Rito.","replies":[{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2016-11-10T05:50:24.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Third Reich,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=ZA9aAOTj,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-11-10T03:30:35.336+0000)\n>\n> Zed, Yasuo, and Lee Sin will never be touched by Rito.\n\nAll of those champions have been touched by rito\n\nAlso yeah shesho the reason it does so much is because they added damage to kicking people into other people. it was a huge buff and seriously unnecessary.\nAs a lee player I loved it but he definitely didnt need a damage buff.\nAlthough this scenario is a bit biased, I do agree.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I am Ben","date":"2016-11-10T03:29:06.221+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed on all points.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-11-10T01:20:30.115+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I've been playing shit ton of lee recently, and I have to agree with you that his ult is just straight up broken.

Lee Sin is a very high skill cap champion. The vast majority of people trying to play Lee Sin are definitely not at the level to deal 1000 damage with their ultimate. Here's why:\nThe Lee Sin provided in your screenshot is a good Lee Sin Player. Chances are he kicked multiple enemies and you were one of them who got hit, taking more damage. This is because Dragon's Rage deals an additional 12/15/18% of your bonus health as physical damage if it hits multiple targets.\nLee Sin falls off really hard towards the late game, at around the 25 minute mark is when he begins to fall off. He may be strong, but at this point the enemy team is getting stronger by building up items, thus becoming stronger and tankier. Lee isn't strong enough to kill these opponents, nor is he able to sustain the high amounts of damage.\nThere are two types of Lee Sin players; those who build a couple of damage items at first then go full tank, or Lee Sins who take full damage. Full damage builders have a significantly high chance of losing games that last longer than 30 minutes, he is simply not strong enough to kill enemies who can easily be protected by supports, exhausts, etc, and he will without a doubt get blown up within 2 seconds. Semi-tank Lee Sins are designed to be able to deal sufficient damage throughout the game, and be tanky enough to soak in damage during teamfights. \nIf you think about it, Lee Sins who build full-tank are completely useless. They have no proper use in fights, his ''playmaking'' abilities and W as a shield is easily beaten by top-tier tanks. He would be complete garbage if he was just a tank.\n\nLee Sin can also get countered very easily. He is prone to CC, his insecs can be easily countered by flashes/dashes, he falls off late game, and plays very poorly when behind. As for his Q which so many bronze players complain about, it can be stopped by a correctly-timed CC, and can be easily dodged if you actually bother to sidestep, which is something that is only existent in Platinum OCE+.\n\nLastly, the preseason patches are an indirect nerf to Lee Sin. He struggles to clear Raptors and Krugs, as he is a single-spell based jungler and has slow clear in comparison to other junglers. He is now forced to take Thunderlords as his keystone mastery, making him squishier and other junglers have now overtaken him.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-11-10T15:45:02.111+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">If you think about it, Lee Sins who build full-tank are completely useless.\n\nThis is how most challenger players have been playing lee for ages, so most challenger players are useless.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2016-11-10T09:01:29.833+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"they should've gone through with his rework in i think it was preseason 4 or something.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2016-11-11T09:15:56.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=ZA9aAOTj,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-11-09T21:23:43.730+0000)\n\n> The same is true for Zed, riot even admitted that Zed has constantly pushed other assassins like Talon way out of the spotlight.\n\n\nFeels bad as I am a Talon main {{champion:91}}  :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"AetherPhoenix","date":"2016-11-11T09:10:46.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you get hit by someone else he kicked, it deals a % of their max hp to you as well as the normal damage.
