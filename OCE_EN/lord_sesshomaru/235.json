He shouldn&#039;t be expected to _(as a tank let us not forget)_ be 9/1 at 20 minutes.\n\nThat shouldn&#039;t be the average score of any champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-10-15T22:07:32.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've always grown up learning that C is average. Even if you scaled it up to B being average (since you are adding an S Tier), A is still not average, but quite a bit above average.

Which seems unlikely.\n\nIts more likely that B is the absolute average score, but even then if A is only slightly above average (with 9/1) that means that his B score is still an incredibly good score.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-10-16T00:49:49.725+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The scores are graded on a bell curve to the best of my knowledge. The bell curve means that instead of it being \"get above x score to get an S\" it's, \"be in the top x% to get an S\". 2% was thrown around a while ago but I can't speak to it'as accuracy, nor if that 2% was supposedly for all S grades or only S+.\n\nFor reference this is what a bell curve looks like:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/QXH5ro2.jpg\n\nIf we assume B is the 0 standard deviation (aka the average) then that means B is always going to be the most common score, since there is always a fixed percentage of Bs, As, etc. So to get any given grade you have to be in the top or bottom % defined by Riot (ofc we don't know what those percentages are). If we assume A covers the top....let's say 20%, and S- is the top 10% then that means your friendos score landed between the top 10 and 20%, which is still well above the average.\n\nIn a bell curve like this the average will always be 50% since it's a median average, we just don't know what grade lands where on the curve.\n\nIf anyone lives in Queensland they ought to know all about bell curves since it's how the OP (school grading) system works (which btw is the dumbest thing ever).","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-10-16T01:34:06.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I understand that system, I'm pretty sure thats how they would grade it too.\n_(and yea its a dumb system, it screws people over if you happen to get a class full of intelligent people)_\n\nBut it doesn't change the fact that Garen is getting wicked good scores and they aren't counting for much.\n\nI 100% guarantee you that you get 9/1/2 with farm like that on Azir at 20 mins, and thats an S+ in the bag. \nAnd thats coming from a champ who is supposed to get kills _(Garen is not exactly supposed to be a DPS kills champ remember)_","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-10-16T07:50:39.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah but Garen can also be one of those snowbally tanks that gets too tanky to kill and too damagey to escape, which unfortunately means that his high scores are really high, while his low scores probably aren't all that low (being low skill cap). That being the case all the just good scores are pushed way down in ranks, and only the truly phenomenal scores will get the coveted S+ ranks.\n\nIt sucks sometimes, but I see the logic in using a bell curve. It rewards the best of the best (without discriminating by bronze-challenger rank) and makes it difficult for just casual players of a champion to get random S+ ranks. They mean more this way.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-10-16T00:31:25.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure where you are getting this from.\n\nF - Fail\nE - 51-60%\nD - 61-70%\nC - 71-80%\nB - 81-90%\nA - 91-100%\n\nC isn't nearly as bad as just passing in most places, this is the grading system.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-10-16T01:38:01.252+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Not sure where you are getting this from.\n\n4 years of having to work the university system.\nSome courses you couldn't even get into without getting A's, \nso D's and E's were most certainly out of the question.\n\n\"C's get degrees\" is the saying.\n\nNot \"E's get degrees\"... because they don't, because E is a fail, at least at that level.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talontless ","date":"2017-10-16T06:08:47.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Goddamn, those are my marking guidelines at high school","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-10-16T01:36:02.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At my University, C is 55% (C- is 50%), with A+ being 90% and D- being 35% (and E is <35%).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"kaeota","date":"2017-10-17T14:47:10.366+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not shown:\nWards - placement and removal; I've found basic warding and counter warding will almost guarantee an S so long as I'm playing half decently. \nGold and backing timing - is another big issue in the formula; if he hung in lane until he could outright his boots and an item, he lost his S right there.\nDamage done and taken - also known as fight participation; participating in kills is great, but if you're always late to the fight you're not much good.\n\nAlso, 121 CS is actually trash at nearly 23 minutes; bear in mind an S is meant to be an amazing game, CS wise I'd say only Vayne was even in the running. Also, tanks are generally rewarded more for assists than kills (from what I've seen - I don't have the actual formula) so he may have gained less towards an S than if he went 2/1/9.\n\nI'd also point out that, as others have said, A is above average - probably in around the 80th percentile, if not slightly higher. I would say that he did perform around an A, based on the score and your praise - I assume he had a great game, he's probably done better, but it was great. He did not perform (according to stats) like he was an amazing Garen who completely outclassed his opponent, and did massive amounts for his team (he'd have both more CS and assists if he did). None of this is to detract from him, I'm simply stating.\n\nI do agree with the underlying argument you're making here though, if I understand correctly, just not with your specifics. \nI think that we (well, riot) need to be watching where their system places the S benchmark, especially as it's tied to the loot crates. Players want a rewarding experience, more over we want a continually rewarding experience. I shouldn't be getting an S every other game (like I used to when the system was new), but likewise, I should be able to get at least one a week (I consider myself a \"barely silver\" player, though my ranking is normally mid - high silver; to put this in perspective) - especially on champions that I 'main'. To this ends, I think the system should also account for skill of the player; maybe half half, if my game is 3* better than my normal, but only an A - A+ by the entire player base average, I should get an S- - S in my humble opinion; and I think this would rectify your issue as well, as your friend would then have likely scored ~S-.\n\nLong post, but I hope that A) I helped you understand the system a little more (it's terribly documented, like everything LoL related) and B) put some valid thought-food into the general mix. \n\nPeace!","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-10-17T23:14:57.209+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That game was 22-23 mins long?","replies":[{"poster":"kaeota","date":"2017-10-18T02:52:06.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"53 was a typo, meant to type 23 - thanks for the catch.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"jadelink","date":"2017-10-23T08:22:51.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're also competing against those who can CS, where 120 at 20 mins would be regarded as tragic on a good splitpush top like Garen.
