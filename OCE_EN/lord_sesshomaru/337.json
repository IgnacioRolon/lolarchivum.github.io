You should have more than 300 cs at 30 minutes and you should get a S / S+.

If you had of had 430ish cs you probs would of gotten an S. Also pink wards seem to help the score a fair bit (destroying and placing) plus not many ADCs buy them so the system will favor you a bit more if you do.\n\nThe system just sucks ass in general tbh the only way I get S or S+ is by playing like a bitch, powerfarming & spamming pinks in places they wont even last long (just placing a pink without your old one dying probs doesn't count it toward your score)","replies":[{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-10-26T00:32:55.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As said by many others on the site, the system compares you and how well you played that champion in that role compared to others in your region.\n\nVery simply, you didn't perform as well as the top players dide on that champion in your role.","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2016-10-26T02:45:57.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know it compares you to others based on kda, cs, objectives, wards etc. The thing is it weighs cs and warding much more than anything else when taking into consideration the score you will get. I have had games where I just went top with teleport farmed to 300cs in 30 minutes and never participated in helping my team where I have gotten S. I also have had games with a shit score 8+ deaths and not much farm but I've placed a ridiculous amount of pinks and gotten S that way. I have had games where I go 15/0/10 or something and get objectives and win the fights for my team but because my cs is garbo I get an A+.\n\nI mean I can see why they make the system the way it is otherwise people would be all \"OMG [REDACTED] YOU STOLE MY KILL\" and you would have people all trying to last hit the tower when it falls etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-10-26T02:57:23.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But anyways who really cares about grades?
