Im above 50/50 win rate and still aren&#039;t going anywhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Sarge","date":"2016-05-13T00:16:58.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're wrong.\n\nThanks for posting though.\n\nBye.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Socon","date":"2016-05-12T02:18:32.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The more games you play with a 0-50% win rate, the less LP you will earn for winning. You need to improve your play to at least a 55% to start climbing. If you're winning something like 70-90% of your games you will start to get a lot of LP from wins, until you start losing again and you stabilize at that rank.

If you are winning 50% of your games then it means you are where you are meant to be, and will stay there. To climb you need a positive win rate, and to fall you need a negative one. \n\nOf course there are exceptions, until you've played a decent number of ranked games it's a bit inaccurate since an early win or loss streak will skew your win rate. But generally speaking if you have a 50% win rate then your true mmr matches where you are, and you ought to be losing/gaining about the same amount of LP.\n\nThe only way you'd be climbing with 50/50 would be if your mmr was way higher than your tier, and that would even out pretty quick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jonius7","date":"2016-05-11T05:58:39.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LP gain is dependent on your MMR compared to the MMR of players in your division. If you're gaining less LP than you're losing, there's not much you can do except continue to win more games to increase your MMR. Or you could try dodging tricks...?\n\nAlso climbing can be easier/take less games this season because of the promo helper. I could have been stuck failing several promos without it.","replies":[]}]}
