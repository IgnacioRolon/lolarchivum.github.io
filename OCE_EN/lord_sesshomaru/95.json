I cant hear you! you&#039;re not plat....&quot;_ type way.\r\n\r\n**One argument is:** No, a low elo player has nothing to offer a high elo one, because if they knew how to do it, they&#039;d be able to do it themselves.\r\nWhich has some merits to it.\r\n\r\n**The other argument is:** Yes, There is more to ranking up than just knowledge, a player needs good reaction time, awareness, on-the-spot decision making, champion mechanics, time and will to actually play ranked, and just some good old fashioned luck. So it is possible to be knowledgable about the game, but still be in low elo for any number of reasons. \r\nThis side of the argument too, has merit.\r\n\r\nI personally believe in the second argument, and my point would be Stephen Hawking, he knows a lot more than many other scientists, but is incapable of performing even a single experiment. Does that make him a bad scientist? Or make his knowledge any less credible?\r\n\r\nBut equally, an argument for the other side would be a sports coach, can you be taught something by someone who hasn&#039;t actually been in your shoes and played the sport at your level?\r\n\r\n__________________\r\n\r\nSo, what does everyone think about this matter.\r\n\r\nHigh elo players, pretend you have a problem and a Bronze player has offered you what seems to be a decent solution. Do you accept their advice? If yes. why? If no, why not?\r\n\r\nLower elo players, is your intelligence any less because of the colour of your league profile? Why should a high elo player listen to you? Or why shouldn&#039;t they?\r\n\r\nLeague has a very strong &#039;caste system&#039; mentality, many high elo see low elo players as lesser human beings. While many low elo players revere pro players as gods. Lets break into this mentality a little and examine it.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-11-03T01:07:26.205+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only time that is true is for Bronze people. MIght sound bad, but imo, you can have terrible mechanics but as long as you put some thought into you gameplay, champion choices and tactics, you will easily get out of Bronze.\n\nAbove Bronze you get your variances. People with great knowledge and poor mechanics and vice versa, but only with both can you get to high Diamond and above.\n\nI'm sure there are Silver players with more knowledge than a Plat player but have terrible mechanics and find it hard to 1v9 carry. There are certainly people who 1 trick pony lane bullies and have little game knowledge except for their champion and smash lane = smash game and probably climb all the way to Plat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-11-03T05:27:36.351+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes people aren't high ranks because they have toasters and/or potato net.\n\nSometimes higher ranked players can win games, but have no idea how to adapt an item build to a specific situation.\n\nIt goes both ways.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Outis","date":"2017-11-03T00:42:17.172+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's not quite as simple as yes/no. there's plenty of people in bronze/silver that have higher game knowledge than the average player that they play with or against. but i dont think you can claim that they have the same knowledge as higher ranked players until they do play with and against people of that rank on a regular basis. these people, however, probably have the capacity and would be able to gain this knowledge and probably deserve to be in that elo where they can gain it, rather than being \"stuck\" somewhere where there isn't really much to learn and improve on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-11-02T23:09:33.855+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"My short answer would be yes but no. \n\nHigher ranked players are more likely to have better game knowledge but it's not a 100% thing. I think we've all played with someone who is above rank in us in norms and thought how the hell are you that rank. \n\nAt the same time I see plenty of people at my elo (Bronze 2) make absolutely terrible decisions. Like farming the jungle after an ace instead of taking baron. If you try and point that out they'll tell you your wrong and they know better. \n\nI guess it also depends what you mean by high elo. The people who I've interacted with who are plat and diamond seem to be perfectly pleasant as long as your willing to listen to them. The ones I find obnoxious are the ones in gold who think they know everything because there gold. \n\nPlus some of the game knowledge you gain at lower elos is straight up wrong. Over time you learn to do things in bronze and silver that straight up won't work in gold+. So in a way some of your knowledge is not relevant to someone who's playing higher elo. \n\nRank doesn't necessarily determine a players game knowledge but it tends to be a decent indicator. You'll get outliers, people in bronze who pay a lot of attention when given the opportunity to learn but don't have the mechanics or time to climb. And people who are gold + who got there via mechanics alone and no knowledge (or boosting). But over time these people would still likely filter out. The people who are boosted will fall and the people who have a good game knowledge in bronze will manage to grind there way out. \n\nTLDR: Rank isn't everything and you shouldn't dismiss or automatically assume someone is right because of it. But it tends to be a pretty decent indicator most of the time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-11-03T06:40:35.085+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"if your rank mattered the game wouldn't be balanced by silvers http://garnetgaming.net/data/avatars/s/1/1015.jpg?1470704015","replies":[]},{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2017-11-03T12:14:36.113+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think game knowledge = to rank. Examples of this are coaches and casters. Rivingtonthe3rd is Gold V and yet he demonstrates high game knowledge when he commentates. Another big example is Skt's coach: Kkoma. Kkoma is acknowledged by the community to be the best league of legends coach in the world.  But yet, Kkoma is hard stuck Diamond IV/V in his games. I think what separates coaches and casters, who have much better game knowledge than challenger lcs players  is their high mechanics and quick judgement ingame","replies":[]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-11-03T09:13:58.202+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also consider that some of the OPL pros are coached by Platinums etc. Even Kkoma is only platinum in Korea (he might have let it decay a little). A lot of OCE challengers have excellent mechanics but poor understanding of the game. However this is masked in soloqueue. Especially because their opponents have the same issues.\n\nGame Knowledge is only one component of your rank. There's many other factors like mechanics (this includes computer components and posture), mentality (this emcompasses mood and motivation), luck, intent (whether you want to troll, one trick, or actually practice meta, etc).\n\n**Can someone of lower ranking, provide helpful game advice to someone of higher ranking?** Of course they can, if the higher ranked person does not already know this something about the game. And you can bet that this can be true in OCE, because we don't have any world class players. There's plenty of gaps in game knowledge amongst OCE players. For example, Chiefs have had a problem for many years now, that they lack patience in critical situations in the game. A proper coach/analyst would have spotted this and had them work on it in an efficient manner. Just one example.\n\nThe moments or areas where a lower rated player would be able to give a higher rated player advice would be rather thin however. It would be in very niche situations, for example perhaps in a certain champion matchup, or meta shift theory, or in situations where the average high mmr player does not know about. it's all relative to what you are calling high and low.  In general, in most situations the lower rated player would offer nothing new to the higher rated player.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-11-03T08:24:07.177+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm currently in Silver but have at least Gold+ in game knowledge, as I've been playing for 4 years I know quite a lot about the game. What's keeping me in silver however is my champion mechanics. I main Darius, not the most mechanical of champions, so naturally when I play someone like zed I find myself all over the fucking place and I look like a retard. Sure, I might of made the smart decision of not engaging a fight at the wrong time, but as soon as I engage at the right time my mechanics kick in and boom I'm dead. Just look at someone like, I don't know, maybe, SKT's COACH? KKoma is in PLAT, BUT HE'S COACHING THE BEST LEAGUE TEAM IN THE WORLD??? That's because he knows a shit ton about the game, he's smart, but when you look on YouTube the only highlight of him I've seen is him getting a quadra with KAYLE, he sits there and right clicks away, no mechanical skill at all.\n\nSo yes, the second argument is right.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bushyman477","date":"2017-11-03T06:08:09.804+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think so; I'm a silver player. Well, I hate ranked so I don't try climbing, but thats what i've been given twice after provs. I feel I have a great understanding of the game. My macros are good. I'm just an average player. I don't like grinding champs, I don't play flavour of the month champs, sometimes I know diving/staying on low health but I stay anyway cause whatever, and to top it off, im a console player, my accuracy with a keyboard and mouse is very average (i sometimes struggle clicking on the small krugs ffs...). But all in all, I feel if I got better and playing pc games and i developed a want to climb I think I could atleast get gold if not platinum. \n\nSo yes.
