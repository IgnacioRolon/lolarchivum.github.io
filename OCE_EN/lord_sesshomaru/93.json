I would avoid spending too much time in Tokyo, its an amazing place, and I'm sure theres tons to do if you live there! But if you're just visiting for a short time and don't have the local knowledge of where all the best spots are, it just becomes another big city. But if you do like pokemon definitely pay a visit to Akihabara in Tokyo, its Okatu central and when I was there, we saw people flooding the street with their nintendos getting in range for a wifi giveaway event. Plus theres all year round cosplay and anime stores galore. ^^","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Willy Donka","date":"2018-08-01T06:36:00.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It feels half-assed, everyone gave so many good option that weren't a shitty anubis looking piece of trash, and they went and made it as shitty as possible.\n\nAnd they did this on my fucking birthday, I just hate this so much, Dark star, star guardian, battlecast and arcade are all wide open. Why didn't they choose a good skin line for his first skin :(","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-08-02T02:02:38.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dark Star, Arcade and Star Guardian seem to be trending towards set releases (i.e a group of the skins released at once), so he's not necessarily out for those themes just it'll most likely be tied to an event of some sort. \n\nBattlecast has been somewhat redefined over the years and for a champ like Sol would likely be legendary tier thus incurring a much longer development time, though it seems unlikely he'd end up with both since they're thematically similar.\n\nYou also have to remember personal taste is a factor. Generally speaking I'm not a fan of any of the Mecha or Battlecast skins, and I much prefer the fantasy or magic based themes, but I'm not going to hold that against Mecha Sol. Everything I've seen of it tells me it's a well made skin, even if it personally doesn't appeal to me.\n\nIn fact I actually *really* don't like Zoe's release skin, which you tout as being amazing and epic. Personal preference plays a huge role here.","replies":[{"poster":"Willy Donka","date":"2018-08-02T06:45:28.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dark star has been moving more towards single skin releases, Dark star cho'gath might count for that? but dark star jarvan didn't come with anyone else. Arcade usually gets released towards September, so there is a chance for a battle boss or arcade skin for Sol.\n\nCyber pop Zoe isn't \"Amazing\" It's just better than what we were handed with ashen lord, fire skins have been overused imo, but cyber pop zoe was new, and has more potential than Ashen. I'm also slated more towards fantasy and magic. But the only tech skins I enjoy are Battlecast and project. Mecha is very boring, with the exception of Sion and Kha'zix. Those skins were done amazingly.\n\nMost people on the feedback thread have said that they're disappointed with mecha sol, due to it being quite underwhelming for 2 years without a skin. I'm trying to like the skin, but every time I see the colors on the skin, and the head shape I just remember why I hate it so much.\n\nBut we will see if riot fixes everything wrong with the skin, i'll hold off on getting more pissed at riot until after it's released.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-08-02T13:00:08.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dark Star Cho'Gath was a special case since it was made as a Make a Wish wish. Jarvan was a bit of an anomaly certainly, I don't know if he was just late on development when the others came out but far enough they still released or if that trend will continue. Dark Star is probably also too close to his base theme to release as a first skin for him.\n\nI'd be pretty keen for a Battle Boss skin myself, but Elderwood would definitely be a huge appeal.\n\nI really like Ashen Lord, though I do agree that there are a lot of fire skins, and some are certainly better than others. As cool as Ashen Lord is I think Infernal might have been a better choice.\n\nI think the biggest thing is the timing. If it hadn't been so long since he'd had a skin, or had it not been his first skin (aside from release) then I don't think anyone would have really had any issues, but people have been hyping themselves up and resonating with fan concepts that anything short of a Legendary tier skin or one in an absolute favourite line would probably have been a disappointment.\n\nI agree that perhaps it wasn't the best choice, but I hardly feel it's the worst either. I doubt colour will get more than tweaked given it has chromas, but the head shape is something they'd usually be open to if enough people dislike it (you have to remember that the people who give feedback are *generally* a very small percentage of players).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-08-02T11:28:54.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that with skins a large amount of it is personal taste, like anything visual.\nRegardless of that though, some are just designed better, and with more thought.\n\nDark Star Jarvan for example, visually its great, it looks cool. But thematically, its a brain fart. How they thought the dark star theme was perfect for him will always baffle me. So that simple mismatch turned a good skin into a wtf skin.\nSomeone in the skin team decided that Dark Star Jarvan was more fitting than Dark Star Kench/Cho/Sol/Kayn/Vel'Koz etc. which really makes me doubt their processes.\n\nMeanwhile, Little Devil Teemo isn't that pretty/well-designed, it just looks like teemo in a devil onsie tbh, it's got some neat sounds but thats about it. But it is the PERFECT skin for teemo thematically, it becomes really popular and people enjoy using it.\n\n_____________________________\n\nI am just grateful that Sol is actually getting a new skin, so I feel I don't have the right to judge it too harshly.\n\nIn saying that though, the skin does feel a little 'token'\n_\"Ohhh crap everyone is getting mad at us cos we havent made a skin for this one champ no one gives a f*ck about, uhhh, uhhhhh, lets just pick a well liked skin line, slap some spikes and tech on it, that'll satisfy them!\"_\n\nThere are so many more skin lines that would be more appropriate to Sol's theme/personality.\nElderwood or Deep Sea for example would really suit his theme, turning him into a mysterious forest spirit, or a gargantuan sea serpent would still both fit his personality.\n\nEven a silly skin would suit him as a playful contrast to his arrogance, a pool party skin _(imagine sol in speedos)_, or some other kind of emasculating skin to make his attitude appear comical. Maybe a Christmas one where he has Poros for stars.\n\nI can understand people not wanting a silly skin as his first one though. But tbh, considering his-holier-than thou attitude and incredible sass, I don't think he fits in too well to a group skin line either.\n\nWith his attitude, its hard to imagine him teaming up with other Mechas, or serving Viktor's glorious evolution in battlecast.\nHe doesn't fit the profile for Bloodmoon, PROJECT: or Star Guardian, and doesn't have the attitude to team up with any even if he did fit the profile.\n\nDark Star and Final Boss are really the only big group skins I can see him working with.\n\nSo in my opinion he would suit a solo skin. Make an skin thats a nod to Ao Shin, or some other new theme that you can tailor to fit his theme and personality. Rather than force fitting the champ to the skin line.\n\n\n________________________\n\nThe Mecha Sol skin is well made, thats for sure. \nJust not well thought out. Imo.\nTBH the little Sol that follows cosmic lulu around is a better Sol skin than the mecha, just because its both adorable, and humiliating for him xD\n\nNot that I'm mad tho, any Sol skin is better than none. So I'm happy.\nAlthough.... I would trade it all for this skin:\n\nhttps://goo.gl/images/V4wNzL\n\nThat is a perfect skin in every sense of the word! The fact that Riot has clearly seen this concept and done nothing, rustles my jimmies. Especially when they release half hearted skins like Dark Star Jarvan, when they profess to only making a skin when it 100% suits that champ.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-08-01T07:03:05.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oooh Arcade Sol sounds cool.
