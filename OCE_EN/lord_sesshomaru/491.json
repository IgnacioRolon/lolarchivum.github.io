Whew!\nIm so glad he&#039;s having a better time outplaying the one class that it is his sole purpose to utterly destroy.  He was having a real hard time with all their dashes and untargetability before.\n\n> This helps Zed control minion waves\n\nAlongside his last-hitting minion-executing passive and optional maneless AoE push you mean? Or maybe it&#039;s to accompany the fact than when doing badly in lane, he can sit back and farm safely with Shuriken?\n\n> This helps Zed ... split push\n\nI thought he was an assassin? whose job, is to... youknow...hunt down and kill people.\nThere are whole classes specifically built around split pushing, and those classes do not include &#039;assassin&#039;.\n\nWhy not let assassins do their thing, and split pushers do theirs? They really couldn&#039;t be more opposite...\nOne&#039;s entire purpose is to go where the kills are, the other is to go where they aren&#039;t...\nIt seems counter intuitive to make a champion who excels at both.\n\nI dont see Yorick jumping on peoples faces 100-0 them, then disappearing back into the night to AFk split push.\nNor do I see Kassadin or LeBlanc getting patched to help their split pushing potential.\nSo why is Zed able to do both roles?\n\nIt should be fine if a _single target assassin_ has a slightly harder time clearing minions, _(aren&#039;t they supposed to be getting gold from kills anyway)_.\n\n> and find more windows to use his abilities more aggressively.\n\nYes, because he uses them so defensively right now...\n\nIve felt so safe seeing him charge _(defensively of course)_ under my tower to 100-0 me, \nIll have to keep an eye out for his new offensive plays. I don&#039;t wanna be caught off guard!\n\n\n_________\n\nLike for real Riot?\n\nIm sorry he isn&#039;t picked as much as you want in Pro-play, I really am. \nBut we honestly don&#039;t need this down here in the real world where 90% of players aren&#039;t Faker.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-08-23T04:54:05.484+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"a rare painting of the riot balance team discussing \"needed\" changes\n\nhttp://vintageprintable.swivelchairmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Animal-Animal-acting-human-Monkey-feast1.jpg\n","replies":[{"poster":"The Hanshmear","date":"2017-08-23T06:32:12.885+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look!

I don't think his wave clear is contested by anyone.\n- He essentially has no resource. Energy hardly counts because it's infinite. Imagine if Anivia, Ziggs, Malz, or any other caster and an energy bar.\n- He does the most burst damage out of any assassin. I dare you to correct me on this. Mid lane is my city. \n- He has no risk verse reward. His shadows make him one of the safest assassins to play. He can get in, 100/0 an ADC, and then get out before you blink.\n- Despite being an assassin, he is an amazing split-pusher due to his kit. Unlike Singed or Tryn, he can get away or kill someone 1v2.\n\nZed has never been a weak assassin. Never. He's the Lee Sin of mid lane. Zed and Yasuo do not need buffs, Riot! Their kits are bullshit enough without damage tweaks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-08-23T03:36:26.517+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"HAHAHAHAHAHAHA RIOT YOU'VE REALLY OUTDONE YOURSELVES THIS TIME","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-08-23T03:01:21.222+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"meanwhile what happened to the janna nerfs? where did they go?","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-08-23T05:04:16.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"here at riot games if one particular champion is strong with an item, we just nerf the item.\n\n{{item:3070}} {{item:3504}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-23T05:09:41.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless of course, _multiple_ champions are strong with that item. {{item:3147}}","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-08-23T05:10:53.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah i mean who gives a shit about supports being strong right? those damn supports being to op and having to much gold is an outrage.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-23T05:59:29.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pfffftt it's their own fault! if they aren't good enough to get kills, then they don't deserve any gold.

His combo is hard to land to maximise the damage needed to 100-0 someone.\n\nSure once he's fed he can do that with ease but thats the point of assassins, they snowball hard.\n\nIf you watch a Zed get fed in lane, he's outplaying and outpositioning the enemy nearly the whole time, a bad Zed won't get fed and even to some extent an OK Zed won't faceroll every squishy.\n\nHe's cancer in low elo because his lane opponent is bad and his high skillcap allows for him to outplay at every turn, couple that with him being an assassin and bam you've got an obnoxious champ in low elo.\n\nThe problem isnt his kit or his scaling or even the items he builds, it's the players he verses.\n\n\nAs soon as you get past low gold and under, Zed becomes a much less obnoxious and prevalent champ because you have to still outplay the enemy in order to snowball as hard as say Fizz, who has a safe laning phase and equal 100-0 capability but most importantly, doesn't have to commit when he hits R.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-23T09:07:41.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that Zed isn't a mash the keyboard champ, certainly the outplay of switching shadows to dodge abilities requires a lot of skill and quick reflexes. But maximising his damage combo really isn't that hard.\n\nYou either engage with W or R, and then immediately use the other. Instantly press E upon landing, which guarantees that at least 1 _(but probably all 3)_ spins will land. You then put your cursor on the enemy _(or slightly in front, depending on their movement)_, all shurikens aim at the cursor so its essentially the same as firing just 1, then just press Q, they are already slowed from your 3 spins and at point blank range, so missing isn't really an option, so now all you do is walk up, auto attack them once, procing your passive and duskblade, then press R again and disappear into the night. \n\nThe only thing that actually requires any skill at all is landing his Q, and seeming that most champs in the game have a skillshot of some form, it's not really that big of an ask.\n\nEven Xerath's combo is harder to land.\n\n__________\n\nIn my opinion Zed just has too much going for him, for example there is no reason for him not to have mana. _(literally the only reason he doesnt have mana is because 'other ninjas use energy' which isnt much of a balance excuse tbh)_ also there is no reason for his passive to work on minions. Assassins shouldn't be great farmers, their whole point is killing champions to get strong, they shouldn't be able to farm just as well _(or better even)_ than champs who don't have the same kill potential as them.\n\nMy problem with Zed and other assassins isn't that they 1-hit squishies, thats their whole purpose, they should pretty much always be able to do that! It's all the extra stuff they shouldn't be able to do.\nTwitch shouldn't have assassin burst as well as ADC sustained damage. Zed shouldn't have ranged poke as well as balls-to-the-wall engage. Fizz shouldn't have that much utility and AoE for the sheer amount of damage he does.\n\nAssassins should be like LB, they go in, melt 1 **(ONE)** champion's face off, then get the fuck out and are pointless afterwards for good chunk of time.\n\nMy beef with assassins in general is that League should be like pokemon.\nFire (assassin) is good against grass (sustained damage), grass is good against water, water _(tanky)_ is good against fire. Its all a cycle.\n\nBut it isn't like that... Assassins delete squishies, but also do enough damage to seriously cripple a lot of tanky champs.\n\nAn assassin can do a lot more to win against a tank, than an ADC can do to win against an assassin.\nThat shouldn't be the case.\n\n____________\n\nIt's true that Zed is only a monster in low elo. The problem is; that low elo is comprised of 90% of players.\nSo Zed is more of a problem than not.\n\nBut I agree, as bad as Zed is, nothing compares to Fizz....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LetsTwitch","date":"2017-08-23T08:13:43.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Janna nerfs dissapeared because the core of the problem was the items on buffing champs like Lulu, Karma, Janna are all pretty strong.\n\nRemember how lulu was so strong at the start of the season right up until her nerf?\n\nThen it was karma, who has the same sort of playstyle.
