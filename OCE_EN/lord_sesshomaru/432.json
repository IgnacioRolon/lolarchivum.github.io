All the pick rates for the champions are very different (much lower) from what they were before the change.\n\nAzir and Sol for example had around a 1.6% pick rate, and now they are 0.4% and 0.7%. While champions like Lee and Thresh who were wayyy upwards of 20% last week (before the change), are now around 6%.\nThe win/ban rates seem to be similar to before, its just the pick rates that have changed. Which confuses me...\n\nObviously Lee and Thresh didn&#039;t drop 14%+ popularity within a week, so its clear that lolking must have changed the way they calculate pick-rates (or something). But i now don&#039;t understand what the pick rates mean, or how they relate to what they were beforehand. \n\nI know this may be a dumb question...\n\nBut if someone could explain whats going on, or help me understand it, that would \nbe so helpful xD\n\nthanks haha","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-12-12T23:29:59.014+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it possible it reset with the ranked season?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-13T01:41:22.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought that as well, but if that was the case, the ban-rates would have changed as well.","replies":[]}]}]}
