It did this after I finished a ARAm about 39 minutes ago. But me and my friend both relogged twice (i exited non main and logged into main x 2) but we even though we could NOT see each other on friends lists or etc, he could invite me using a manual name invite to game. We could not talk to anyone during que screen, we could chat IN the game though. But once we won (which was weird because it was a normal and we had to pick champs etc based on what team champs were and their summoner abilities). It seems that the server is intact, but the chat from the NON in game client is not available. IN chat game is working though.
