Your job isn't to kill him 1v1 or sit there expecting to be invincible, its to be tanky enough that you can get your cc/peel off without instantly dying so that your teammates can kill the yi (which will be basically instantly if he is caught with any kind of cc and cant kill your teams damage champs first). If youre playing a tank and getting melted by the yi without someone else killing him first its because you're either out of position or your teams already died and you've lost the fight anyway","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-12-11T08:49:03.260+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Randuin's attack speed slow doesn't apply during Yi's ultimate, however Frozen hearts Aura attack speed slow does. But if he has an {{item:3031}} Randuins might be good with it.\n\nIf he is : {{item:3153}} {{item:1300}} {{item:3931}} {{item:3124}}  and 2 of one of these items: {{item:3053}} {{item:3748}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3812}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3139}} {{item:3033}} {{item:3036}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3074}} {{item:3143}} or skipped the Botrk and took 3 of those items you are basically doneso.\n\nHe has the highest DPS overall - in the end game, of anyone but Veigar or Nasus with massive stacks.\n\nAbout all you can do is buy GA to stop the resets so he can be caught out or have enough lockdown but with the tankier Yi builds and his W then Q he can still shred teams and with the higher DPS teams can just instagib people before they can even land a CC. (R-E-Challenging smite, Q - flash Auto W animation cancel auto can delete an Annie and dodge an ulti and then he will be on the rest of you instantly.\n\nThe best thing to do is rush strong early game items, push hard, shut him down otherwise late game he is a monster only other hyper carries can usually compete with ({{champion:114}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:203}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:23}}  {{champion:38}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:33}} although some Champs can still help against him: {{champion:72}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:12}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:60}}.\n\nMore often than not, Dodging a death with Zhonya's can turn a fight around on him, or some strong CC but if he has a strong team comp and makes it to late game he's hard to deal with without certain Champs on your team (A lot of easy CC) or Hard CC and multiples at that. Plus a lot of burst or really good CC with strong chase and sustained damage to stop him engage and escaping then re-entering fights.\n\nRiot nerfed Armor hard and he can get botrk and does heaps of magic damage with rageblade and devourer and deals true damage so hes stupidly OP IMO excluding his early game weakness. Verse people unprepared he is basically a free win if your team don't snowball and with a few kills he can even turn around that snowball on you.\n\n{{item:3026}} GA is the best item against him for those being focused or caught as it shutsdown his resets, forces him to camp you till you respawn however if they have a strong team following up that's not always gonna help you win the game anyway and there's not much you can really do about it. Try split pushing, warding heaps and going for picks or trying to sneak objectives.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Orange Caramel","date":"2015-12-17T21:40:37.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bruisers are the most op class in the game.
