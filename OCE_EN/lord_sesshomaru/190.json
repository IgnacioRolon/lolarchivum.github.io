(RIOT please help)","subforum":"Miscellaneous","embed":{"description":null,"url":"http://imgur.com/ifjTD1A","image":"http://imgur.com/ifjTD1As.jpg"},"up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"This still hasn&#039;t been addressed (or even acknowledged. which is worse)\r\n\r\nThis is not a moan about a champ being OP or me thinking there is a bug when really its just my stupidity.\r\nthis is a legitimate provable inconsistency with the game. (one that affects gameplay.)\r\n\r\nI Know RIOT cant reply to everything, but this is an important matter, and a reply wold be appreciated.\r\ni have posted about this issue before, and will do again until someone actually acknowledges that it exists.\r\n\r\nAs for the issue itself, the ability indicators on at least 2 champions are incorrect, Anivia and Illaoi\r\n\r\nyou can see in the images below that the spell effect for Illaoi&#039;s Q extends outside the Indicated area, and the Spell effect for Anivia&#039;s Q is much smaller than the indicator.\r\n\r\nWith Illaoi, Gangplank is clearly outside the indicator yet he is still struck. (and unless Gangplank&#039;s hitbox extends way out past his outermost feature (foot) i seriously doubt it is a hitbox problem (and if it is a hitbox issue, then there is still a clarity problem))\r\nhttp://imgur.com/lTbjZoy\r\n\r\nWith Anivia, 4 minions are well and truly inside the indicator (and a 5th is half inside) yet only one is damaged and stunned.\r\nhttp://imgur.com/ifjTD1A\r\n\r\nAs you can see, this is clearly an issue of &#039;Clarity&#039;\r\nnow Worlord Shen&#039;s Flag had an animation error the patch he came out, it would sway correctly one to one side but then jerk over to the other side without animation, and that has been fixed now. So if there is someone that has the time to fix that (much appreciated btw it was very annoying) I&#039;m sure that there is someone who can look into this as this is as issue that actually affects gameplay.","replies":[{"poster":"KDAs","date":"2016-02-17T21:54:39.834+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i too also agree with you on this,  i think but i'm not 100% sure on this, but i feel like with illaoi's e, if you aimed the pull, i think ether slightly to the left or to the right, it wouldn't pull the soul from the champ, unless that has been patched or something, i just feel like with a hitbox as wide as it is, i missed half of my e's by a millimeter sometimes, i think it's time to get good ??????
