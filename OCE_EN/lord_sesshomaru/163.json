There is absolutely 0 support capability in her kit, no CC whatsoever not even a slow, so why is it okay to take her support? Katarina is a pure damage champ that survives off kills, that is not a trait that should be found in a support. And she&#039;s not the only one.\r\n\r\nI know the Meta changes and I&#039;m not disputing that, all I&#039;m saying is R.I.P. the good old days of proper supports.","replies":[{"poster":"WhiteKimchi","date":"2015-12-27T06:07:17.422+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is like 10x more midlaners running spelltheif than there is supports running dorans. \nSoraka is pretty much pick/ban every game and she is probably the closest champ to a true support","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-12-27T02:52:21.299+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like this is a reeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaalllllllllllllllllllyyyyyyyyyyyyyy big generalisation.

You should still use Spellthief's. These kill lanes have always existed, people are just noticing Brand more now (Annie was *huge* with this for a long time).\n\nNothing has changed, there's just a popular kill support on the radar. He also doesn't invalidate traditional supporting in any way either, because if you respect their kill pressure then they can't use that advantage; it's when you ignore them like they have no damage that you get burned. (low elo's are especially prone to not respecting the opponent, so a kill lane works in low elo better)","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2015-12-26T22:11:11.491+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"rip {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-12-26T23:47:46.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"R.I.P Cancer role you will not be missed.\n\n/*spits on grave*\n\n/kicks dirt over burial site\n\n/walks away\n\n/mastery emote taunts\n\n/dances at victory screen","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lunadel","date":"2015-12-26T23:05:09.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't worry...
