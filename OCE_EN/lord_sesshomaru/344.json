So unless they're planning on dropping the Snowdown content on 01/12 it's probably be 1-1.5k 'Snowdown' Tokens.\n\nThat said, I'd really fucking like Riot to stop making all of their event content loot system-exclusive. They know damn well that the Missions will MAYBE give us enough tokens for 1/3rd of the content, 2/3rds with whatever pass they put out with the event, and that we can only get all of the content if we buy loot bundles that come with tokens.\n\nRiot have been doing this shit all year and I'm sick of it. I have every skin in the game and they're still forcing me to buy loot bundles if I want 100% of event content.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-11-21T09:52:45.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The whole thing about the loot system, was that it was supposed to be a way to allow players who can't spent money on the game, to get the occasional skin. as well as providing nice bonuses for players who were loyal to the game and played consistently.\n\nNow it is completely the opposite, it says \"fuck you\" to people who can't spend money, and drains its loyal players dry to earn dick all.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-11-21T02:56:14.144+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's really disappointing (though not wholly unexpected) to see Riot going in this direction. LoL is the one online game I've been able to consistently play and enjoy, yet they always go and make decisions that just seem like it's screwing over the player. It's actually hard to be on the boards justifying why certain players have been banned for whatever when Riot doesn't even seem to care about the players that much anymore.\n\nI really hope they realise that these kinds of things are ruining the game for a lot of players, and subsequently change their direction, though I'm not expecting it to be honest.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-11-21T09:48:19.509+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, I expected them to pull another shitty stunt like Kai'Sa, \nbut I didn't expect it literally the very next day...\n\nFor a long time Riot prided themselves on being a company that listened to the players, and we in turn respected and trusted them for that.\n\nI feel like they stopped listening to us a while back.  \nNow it honestly feels like they are worried for the survival of the game, and are just throwing random new shit at it every day in an attempt to keep people interested. Hoping we will all just think \"Ohh a piece of candy.... ohh a piece of candy... ohh a piece of candy..\"\n\nWhat they don't seem to realise is that people like security. They don't like that their main champ could be reworked at any time for no reason. or that if they stop playing for a week, they'll miss out on exclusive skins/borders.\n\nThis year league has just dive-bombed, I don't know what changed in the management section, but most of the major decisions they make now, are for short term satisfaction, and ultimately reduce the overall long-term quality of the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-11-21T21:46:22.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let your wallet do the talking.\nI used to buy RP, but haven't done so in over a year.\n\nWhen/if LoL returns to it's former glory, I may buy RP again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2018-11-21T06:48:27.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha this is fairly hecking aggravating if I am to be entirely honest with you my family.
