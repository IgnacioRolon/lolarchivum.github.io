(remember it has an AD scaling too, even though warlords and ferver don&#039;t have AP advantages)\r\nPerhaps you value speed over damage so you can catch up and AA them a few more times then you&#039;ll have no trouble with Stormraiders. \r\nOr perhaps you like to be a sheep and follow the other 90% of people, and just take Thunderords like everyone else.\r\nWindspeakers blessing? maybe on Riven? but not many others, tough luck AD champs...\r\nMaybe sustain is more you&#039;re thing, why not take Grasp of the undying.\r\nMaybe you fancy adding some HP in with your damage? most AD champs are a bit of both so why not go Strength of the ages.\r\nBond of stone probably isn&#039;t your thing right? Yea! you&#039;re all about killing things! not helping others.\r\n\r\nfrom my count you get 7 to chose from, and admittedly ADC&#039;s are realistically limited to only 5 (sorry guys) but thats a small price to pay for your 55% win rate Miss Fortune!!\r\n\r\nBut what if you&#039;re a Mage like Syndra or Azir or Anvia or Karthus or Cassiopiea or Xerath etc. etc.\r\n\r\nWant to heal? too bad you don&#039;t use crits aye...\r\nWant some sustained damage? pity you don&#039;t have the appropriate kit or the durability to just stand there and auto the enemy until you get 10 stacks...\r\nPerhaps you want to poke them? well you&#039;re in luck just take Deathfire touch! Woooohooooo!!!\r\nMaybe its move speed that you need? unless you&#039;re Ekko or Kass (neither of whom tbh really need more MS) its not really that useful to you. sorry.\r\nOh! SO THATS why everyone takes thunderlords... because you only have 1 other option... Congrats this is option 2 :D\r\nValue some teamwork? unfortunately in the mid or top lane, you&#039;re usually the only one there so most of Windpeaker&#039;s blessing will be wasted for the first half of the game, plus not many mages have kits that would make full use of it, and those who do are usually better as supports anyway.\r\nNeed some sustain? well after 4 seconds, you!, one of the squishiest roles in the game can have 1.5% (don&#039;t get too exited 3% is only for melee) of your HP back on a auto attack! Of course if you&#039;re in the midst of combat in AA range (in an AD/marksman meta) for a full 4 seconds as a squishy mage, I&#039;m guessing you&#039;ll probably need more than just 1.5% (if by some miracle you&#039;re still alive that is) for it to be useful to you. so we can cross grasp of the undying off the list.\r\nStrength of the ages? on Syndra? no thanks....\r\nHow about some damage reduction? Seeming your job is to deal damage to the enemy and not spread the damage around your own team its probably not your best bet.\r\n\r\nFrom my count... 2... just 2...\r\nPerhaps a few exceptions like Vlad and Swain might broaden the list slightly but not by much\r\n\r\n**Conclusion:**\r\n\r\nif i was one of those overly fanatical feminist zealots id be preaching about equality, but I&#039;m not, so i wont, all i want is some more variety among the more AP centred champions, we get the option of poke or burst... thats it.. poke or burst.. and on most champs its not even much of a choice anyway.\r\n\r\nAD champs get the option of\r\n2 choices of Life Sustain\r\nSustained Damage\r\nPoke\r\nMovespeed\r\nBurst\r\nTankiness\r\n\r\nAP champs get\r\nPoke\r\nBurst\r\n\r\n**Ideas:**\r\n\r\nIts not much but how about adding AP crits like Karthus&#039; Q and Anivia&#039;s E into Warlords as well?\r\nWhat about an AP scaling sustain type mastery?\r\nMaybe some form of minor CC when combing abilities?\r\nOr what about a mana sustain one perhaps every 3 abilities hit in succession returns some mana to you?\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this?","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2016-01-11T00:29:14.508+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does feel empty. Like honestly what the fuck are the masteries meant to do for ap mages. Either you have a full 3 hit combo or you do the spell every now and then. Even then, where is the reward?? Slight damage? A whole mastery tree comes down to giving you slightly more damage. Cool. Amazing. May aswell call it a fucking rune page.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-01-11T02:09:48.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea exactly, theres nothing interesting or tactical about it like some of the AD masteries.\nit feels hollow.","replies":[]}]}]}
