They feel like you have abandoned them.\r\n\r\nand if i didn&#039;t know better id say you had. So just talk to them, show them that you still care for them, explain what is happening.\r\nTell them why they win 10/10 placements and drop from gold 1 to bronze 1, just tell them. \r\n\r\nYou know why obviously, because you wrote the software, and they want to know too. Is that so much to ask?\r\nthey don&#039;t want to hear it from some cocky player who preaches about MMR and &#039;getting good&#039; that no-one takes seriously, \r\nThey want to hear it from you.\r\n\r\n(and this is just some of the OCE people on the first day or two, i ran out of room for screenshots on my desktop without even finishing the OCE comments, let alone the NA and european servers. You cant just ignore a mass cry like this.)\r\n\r\nWe don&#039;t want much, we just want to know why, can you not even give us that?","replies":[{"poster":"A Little Unlucky","date":"2016-01-21T22:59:19.707+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is called a RESET.
