Don't let their abilities do the same level of damage as someone who is entirely ability focused. It's just common sense to me.\n\n_____\n\nTo be clear, I'm not advocating for Lux, I feel dirty playing her she's so strong! \n\nand I'm certainly not saying AP champions are weak. Im just saying AP champs should get their power from abilities. AD champs should get their power from Autos. _(there are exceptions of course, Talon/Zed are non-crittng ability focused AD champs, while Kayle/Azir are high damaging auto attack focused AP champs.)_ But in general, crit champions like Graves and Lucian and Yi shouldn't have such high damaging ability scalings. Just like AP champs like Veigar and Xerath shouldn't have crits.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-06-29T07:04:38.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good old damage creep.","replies":[]}]}
