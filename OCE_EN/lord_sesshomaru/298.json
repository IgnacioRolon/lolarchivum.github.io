With the occasional Cait/Jinx thrown in.\r\n\r\nIts not like the top picks are constantly changing either. Yasuo/Thresh/Lee Sin, have been top of the charts since anyone can remember, and Vayne has been one of, if not THE top picked ADC for at least 2 years running.  Zed recently fell out of it (but not by much), and if history is anything to go by, he will be back in there soon enough. The list goes on.\r\n\r\nI can speak for myself and many others that have posted on the boards, that we are sick of fighting with and against the same champions again and again.\r\nIt is a self-destructive cycle as well, because the champions that are countered by the top picks, (and who are already low on the charts), just fade further and further into non-existence. Aurelion Sol is an amazing champion, but playing him into his biggest counter every second game, gets very old very fast. \r\nSo what new player is going to try playing the already difficult star dragon, when they are vs a champ that smashes them every second game? Not many ill tell you.\r\n\r\nEven if you play champions that counter the top picks, it gets boring for them as well after a while too. There are 131 champions, there is no reason why only 11 of them should be picked.\r\n\r\nOf course, come champions are going to be picked more than others, thats unavoidable! Yasuo is a brooding wandering Samurai, Zed is a masked ninja made of shadows. Those stereotypical unimaginative characters are always going to be popular in the 12-18 age category, thats just a fact. They will probably always be picked more than others, but being picked** this much more** is just ridiculous. It might as well be overwatch where Reaper and Hanzo are the only two characters ever played.\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nSo RIOT I want to know where you stand on the &#039;popular picks&#039; matter, do you think that it&#039;s perfectly acceptable for 11 champions to compose 25% of the picks or not? For either answer please explain why this is your thinking.\r\n\r\n\r\nthank you :)","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-07-28T08:52:27.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Back when we had the super stale **Ezreal** & **Lucian** bot lane meta, someone asked **Riot FeralPony** a similar question.

I believe they are missing that fact.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-07-28T10:35:33.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I think this is absolutely an issue for some champions. \n\nI think the solution might be to incentivise players to try out new roles and champions. This happened a little bit with Hextech Crafting but we could go much further.\n\n**Here's an idea I've had in the back pocket for a while:**\n\n+ Having personalised _\"recommended pick of the week\"_ as part of the free champion rotation. \n\n They could base the \"recommended pick of the week\" on what you played the most last week. (e.g If you play heaps of **Zed** one week, it would add **Talon** as your \"recommended pick of the week)\n\n Also achievements and extra IP for getting a first win on your recommended picks would be awesome too.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-07-29T00:25:17.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea that sounds like a pretty neat idea, especially for people who only play a single champ like Yas or Zed, that way unlike hextech crafting which says: \n\"go out into the big scary world and play one of the 130 champions you've never played before.\"\nit says \n\"why not try this 1 champion out, and see how it goes?\"\n\nwhich is a whole lot more manageable for 1 trick players.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2016-07-29T00:15:12.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is what META is\n\nnothing can be done about it, aside from banning them away, and picking others yourself, the problem with players atm is they all only play noob champs like yas and yi etc, there should be a \"if you played this champ last game, it is unavailable to you\" meaning that you have to use a different champ\n\nthis will impact me too, since i only play thresh, however i am skilled with all other support champs as well, so it just forces you into learning other champs, however applying this to ranked could be dangerous","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2016-07-28T10:20:39.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i remember about a year and a half ago mid lane was yasuo kat fizz zed leblanc and ahri, these days i see alot more control mages and out of those 6 champions i see yasuo like 33% of the time","replies":[]}]}
