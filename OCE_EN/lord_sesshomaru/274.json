Nope nope nope!\n\nHe&#039;s a golden sand emperor, whose soldiers are gold, whose sand particles are gold, and anything that isn&#039;t gold, is purple! Why the hell would you go and put bright blood red in there?!\n\n\nNext patch, please, **please** match it up with each of his skins individually, It needs to be golden or purple on his base, green on his underworld, blue or purple on his galactic, blue or golden on his SKT, and maybe you can keep the red (or green) on his warring kingdoms!\n\nI can see why it only took you 3 months to come up with this rework, you haven&#039;t even made a new particle for him, you&#039;ve just taken some other champ or item&#039;s shitty particle effect and just slapped it on all of his skins indiscriminately. Why?\n\nIt looks hideous!\n\nPlenty of champs like Zombie Nunu have their attack speed boost match their skins.\nYou don&#039;t just get to skimp out here, cos its a &#039;quick fix&#039;.\n\nI can abide by many things, I may not like the rework _(full disclosure will inevitably come later once I have fully tested it)_, but I see that it was necessary in some levels of play. But I can not abide the reckless disregard for aesthetics! When there is no reason!\nIt subtracts from his whole thematic as a golden sand emperor.\n\nIt would take someone a couple of hours **max** to change the colour of these particle effects. \nPlease don&#039;t leave them like this...\n\nI will gladly pay from my own pocket for one of your staff to change the colour of them, if you wont.\n\nPlease... I&#039;m actually begging here.\n\n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"Time Criminal","date":"2017-09-27T03:45:48.303+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it reminds me of Nunu's blood boil, but at least even though blood boil is red, it's like blood, you know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-09-27T01:59:05.315+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"yea that is a bit weird.
