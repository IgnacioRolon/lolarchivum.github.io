When borders came out once a year at most. I was willing to spare $30 a year for cool looks.\nNot anymore. Im sorry, but I don't have a spare $50 per patch....\n\n> If you're dedicated to buying everything for a few champions, you probably are more than prepared to pay for the few exclusives that will ever come out for those champs.\n\nThis was fine when you knew in advance. You know PROJECT: will always get borders, so if you see project skins on PBE and your champ is among them, you can plan for that. These days, who the fuck knows who's getting a border or chroma or not.\n\nWhat happens if you're on holiday _(or some other part of life got in the way)_?  You know a skin for your champ is going to come out, and you'll pick it up when you get back. \nOops. Sorry It had a special chroma and border, sucks to be you!!\n\nWhen it came out once a year, the chances of that happening were slim at best. Now that multiple skin lines per patch get them, it is inevitable.\n\nAlso, what happens when you haven't found a champ yet.\nMaybe Riven was your main, up until you bought Irelia and your world just opened up, now you're best Irelia OCE... but oops. you didn't get the Irelia border when it was out, because she wasn't one of the champs you bought everything for at the time.\n\n> Really the only people affected are new players who pick up and love a champ, and are unable to get that special content\n\nThis is of course the main issue, and I have always argued against there being any form of limited edition stuff.\nBlack Alistar is an awesome skin! its just great. And 99% of us will never ever see it in game. What part of that is beneficial?\n\n> There also hasn't (as far as I know) been any official word that the special red chromas and borders won't be coming back\n\nWe both know thats not the way Riot work.\nThey also haven't released offical word that Yasuo won't be removed from the game.... So theres hope right?\n\nAnd if they do bring borders back, it wont be a 'once-a-year' thing because otherwise we would have seen PROJECT: borders return already with the release of Vayne/etc. And Yasuo/Riven borders with VS.\n\nWhich means that if borders do come back, it'll just be pot luck for who gets them.\n_\"Oh, you happened to be logged into league between the 16th and 26th of November 2022? congrats heres all this neat stuff. If you played your ass off before or after that date... well.. you obviously don't deserve anything.\"_","replies":[]}]}]}
