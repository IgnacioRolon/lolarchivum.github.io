That helps no-one.\n\nThe fact that they have plans for redistribution probably means they will be easier to get the second time around. Same principle as the chroma or early sales. You can get the thing easier/cheaper, but you won't be the first to have it.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-12-07T12:31:11.451+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> All I'm saying is don't pull out the pitchforks until you have all the information.\n\nI mean, I'm just going by their track record.\nSo far, there are 2 skins that involve heavy grinds or spending. And a hollow twitter promise that the next one will be _\"different. Information withheld\"_.\n\nIt's like saying _\"He only murdered 2 people, and he promises not to do it again, don't lynch him, we can still trust him!\"_\nIll put the pitchforks away when I see real change, until then, ill go by what they do, not what they promise.\n\n> Give Riot actual feedback on what your issue with the Prestige skins is and why\n\nYou're saying this to me of all people?\nThe guy who usually makes novels for posts intricately describing the nuances of highly specific things.\nI only devolve to these kinds of posts when i've either already discussed the matter concisely and civilly, or its blatantly clear what the problem is and doesn't need clarification.  The point of these kind of posts are just to keep the spirit alive long enough for Riot to pay attention. _After all 1000 morons complaining is louder than 5 professors debating._\n1000 wallets > 5 wallets.\n\nPlus, all you need to do is look at every single place on the internet where the prestige skins are featured and you'll clearly see the very negative attitude towards them.\n\n> This is the first time they've done anything of the sort, live testing introduces a whole slew of things in house testing (no matter how extensive) just can't cover.\n\nThese are the creators of the most popular online game in the world, with estimated 32 million players. \nLet's not pretend like they don't know exactly what they are doing.  They predicted exactly how feasible getting the Kai'sa skin was and knew people were going to have to fork out money for it, that's why the made it the price it was, _(and that was after you had to pay to do the grind in the first place.)_\n\nAs for redistribution, that won't solve the problem, people want it for the exclusivity, not the skin itself. And if it doesn't have the border and all the other shiny things, people are still going to have to jump though the hoops when it comes out. \nAdmittedly though it is better than shit like Black Alistar and _real_ Championship Riven.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
