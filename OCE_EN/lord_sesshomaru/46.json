If they are as \"OP\" as you say then you should net wins. - Don't complain about champions that are good, learn to play them and use them to win the game. Play smarter - not angrier.","replies":[]},{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-07-06T02:29:11.189+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to think that Jax, back in the day, was an unkillable machine and I had no idea how to beat him until I played him and learned how he worked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-07-06T01:49:27.759+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello lvl 7 darius main here. I think you'll find that the ad scaling of darius's Q is 140% of his AD and he doesn't need to build much ad anyway since he gets up to 200 bonus AD (At lvl 18) at 5 stacks. Meaning after black cleaver you legit build full tank and sustain while trying to reach 5 stacks to achieve that sweet dunk :)","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-07-07T03:54:39.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Stop. You are Bronze III.\n\nLike, why are you giving advice at all?\n\nOkay, you are Darius VII, but always remember that you are a BRONZE Darius VII.\n\nSorry, but I've watched a lot of Bronze Youtube videos and I have no patience for Bronzies at all.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-07-07T09:35:24.540+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sigh. \"Every bronze player has no idea how to play the game and especially no idea how to play their main champ/role\".\n\nThere are a lot of reasons for been bronze. One could be not playing much ranked past the provs. Another could be not caring too much about league and playing it casually, or for fun. Whatever the case, some bronze players aren't as bad as you think they are, at least in OCE.\n\nI have a good understanding of mid and have memorized matchups, items, situational decisions, damages of enemy champions, but I only play ranked once in a while because my friends like it. I prefer normals or the RGMs. \n\nI have seen Fitzky play Darius, if he starts learning more things like focusing, situtational itemization like ZZ'Rot, he could get to high silver - low gold within a year. But the fact that he isn't GOLD V doesn't make him a horrible or dumb or new player.\n\nBy the way, I hope you don't think too highly of your rank. You are a good player, there is no doubt to that. But if you go around trash talking bronzes when you remain in low gold to sometimes I'm assuming high silver and mid gold makes you seem a little desperate for attention.\n\nIt's the same as plat players saying that you are garbage and have no idea how to play the game. They are substantially better, but if they are going to trash talk lower ranked players then themselves comparitively then they come off as an ass.\n\nAgain, you aren't a Darius main, this guy is. He has a better idea of what he's talking about on Darius than you do, regardless of rank. The fact that you decide to stereotype is not my concern, but can you just accept that just because you are Gold V at the time of posting it doesn't mean you can silence people trying to help people?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-07-08T08:05:44.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure it doesn't take much knowledge to google search how much ad scales off of a champ's ability and what to build on a champion.
