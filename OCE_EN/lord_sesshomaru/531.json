Cool, that's really nice. Very generous.\r\nBut why is it more expensive?\r\n\r\n100% of the proceeds are going to charity anyway, so why does it need an extra charge? Are we paying more for the privilege of it being a charity skin?\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, of course I'm happy to support charity with my purchase, I think thats great!  _(I've bought every charity skin/icon etc. to date, even the ones I didn't want and don't use.)_ But I still do want to know what I'm paying for.\r\nWhat is that extra 100 RP for?  If there is a valid reason for it _(I.e. covering the cost of transferring the money to the charity, or legal fees etc.)_ I'm happy to pay, but if it's just randomly tacked on _'just cos we can get more than usual from you cos it's charity.'_ then that's underhanded and goes against the principles of charity in the first place, and I'm not so comfortable supporting that kind of attitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n_(This is not a rhetorical question btw, I would really like an answer here please.  What is the extra 100RP for?)_\r\nThank you","replies":[]}
