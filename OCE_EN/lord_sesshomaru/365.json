But i just ask that you compare the splashes before you switch them and ask not &#039;how old is this one compared to this one.&#039; but &#039;how good is this one compared to this one.&#039;\n\nbecause some of the new splashes are just a mistake, and we can all see that.\n\nwe want change, but change for improvement, not change for the sake of change.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-04-13T23:13:53.678+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nunu bot is worse.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Légs","date":"2016-04-14T05:01:43.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree about Darius, but damn his new splash art is awesome.\n\nRammus probably needs it the most.\n\nEDIT: yes I did see the new splash arts. good to see my main eve get some love. rammus looks adorable :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-04-13T23:22:53.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey dude,\n\nReally cool to see you are enjoying some of the updated splash arts!\n\nJust wanted to jump in here, we recently did a global unification of splash (not to be confused with updating splash art!)\n\nYou can read more about it here - \nhttp://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/client-new-features-feedback/sT9ZIVzT-splashes-unifying-updating-and-you\n\nBut I will list some of the key points for you below;\n\n> We had two major goals of the Unification:\n> \n> Unify the representation of all characters to achieve global parity between splashes. A League of Legends champion shouldn’t be different solely due to where you are in the world. A consistent high quality splash should represent a character equally for all players.\n> \n> Fix internal development issues. In line with making our work more efficient, we often analyze areas of redundancy to get rid of problem areas. Each time we have a new splash created, it’s typically an unruly amount of work to determine if a region should obtain the new splash, keep their own, get it into their build, etc. This can lead to things such as Tencent getting their patches a week later, which isn’t fair for their players, and has rippling impacts onto the eSports scene.\n\n> Let’s be clear - many of these assets are not permanent, and don’t meet our quality bar. We had to make a decision on many splashes to take either one or the other- even when both weren’t great","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-04-14T01:12:11.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhhh ok i see, thanks for clarifying that! keep up the good work! :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2016-04-13T23:43:53.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"New Skarner Splash art would be nice.
