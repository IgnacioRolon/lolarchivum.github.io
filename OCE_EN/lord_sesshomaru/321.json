Your status and customisable item list, are not the same if you log in on a separate computer.\n\n2. sometimes in ranked you cannot lock in your champ. the button is greyed out, and you must wait for the timer to expire.\n\n3. when a player is selecting a champion their box turns from dark to light grey, but sometimes it stays light grey even after they have locked in. \n(usually 1st pick)\n\n4. (not a bug) just bad design, when you are selecting a champ, your name box expands, but your honour ribbon doesn't, leaving it floating randomly and making the game look cheap and tacky.\n\n5. some players names disappear from their leagues, (me and a friend of mine are in the same devision in the league 'Fizz's scouts' i used to be able to see his name in the league list, but now i cant (yet he is still in that league) \n\n6. if you click on someone else's profile and click leagues to see their ranking in that league, sometimes (often) it just shows your own league, even though you are still on their profile. \n\n7. (major problems caused in champion select) (always occurs) if your curser is hovering over a champions portrait (and their abilities pop up where the text is) then someone quits and the lobby disbands, when you enter the new lobby, the champion's abilities are still there preventing you from typing or even seeing what others have typed, for about 10 seconds, this results in not being able to call your lane and not knowing where other people are going. (only noticed in normals, untested in ranked) \n\n8. some champions have 2 classic splash arts in champion/skin select, (Vel'koz is one) \n\n9. (always occurs) When Azir starts on the red team's platform, when you click to move off to your lane, for his first few 'steps' he just hovers/slides along in his idle animation (lasts about 1.5 seconds) \n\n10. (not sure if bug, but is really annoying) when you are in the store looking at something other than the 'featured' tab if you leave the store (even if just for a second) when you next click on store, it will take you back to the thing you were looking at for a few seconds and then will flick back to the 'featured' section.\n\n11. If you haven't played at least 5 champs in ranked, when you look at your 'Top played champions' in your league ranking, it will insert random champs, that you haven't played (the ones i got, i have never played them in ranked in any season, and one never even in normals) this can be very annoying as someone might not want to be seen as a Yi, Garen, Riven etc. player, also it is misleading for anyone else who happens to look at your profile (providing bug 6 lets you)\n\n12. DJ sona doesn't count as an ultimate skin in the store, (clicking the button for 'ultimate', and clicking off the button for 'not owned') only brings up udyr and ezreal's ultimate skins.\n\n13. (this could affect gameplay but i haven't tried) if you are a ranked team captain, and you make the team on one computer and then log in and try to edit it on another, you are unable to use the 'manage team' button (which is slightly important)\n\n14. if you click the 'Cancel searching for match button' at the exact same moment as a match is found it gives you a warning message saying that you cant leave searching while there is a match, then when you click accept on the match, you cannot see the little people icons that appear when others join, and when the time runs out it just stays on that little window for ages then when that goes you aren't in a match and when you go to join a queue again, you get a message saying 'you are already assigned to a match' yet it still doesn't put you into the match. \n\n15. sometimes in the in game-store a purchased item won't have a tick next to it, this can lead to double purchases.\n\n\nMost of these bugs are just visual and don't really affect gameplay (with the exeption of 7 which means you cant call lanes or see what lanes are called, and 13/14 which can potentially mean you cant play)\nbut even though they don't directly influence gameplay, they are annoying and some of them like DJ sona's one are easy fixes, so it would be nice to have them fixed if possible.\n\nIf anyone else knows of any i haven't mentioned then please post them in the comments. and up vote if you want, so Riot has a good chance to read this.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-08T14:59:44.845+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">some players names disappear from their leagues, (me and a friend of mine are in the same devision in the league 'Fizz's scouts' i used to be able to see his name in the league list, but now i cant (yet he is still in that league)\n\nIs your friend active in ranked?\n\n(if you get to the 28 days inactivity you automatically get taken off the list.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-08T06:12:46.782+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> some champions have 2 classic splash arts in champion/skin select, (Vel'koz is one)\n\nNami also.\n\nOne bug that really annoys me is when I set my status to \"away\" but the client decides it's in charge and automatically changes it to \"online\". This has resulted in me getting numerous invites to queue with people despite not actually using my computer at the time (usually when I leave for a few minutes to do something).\n\nAlso, {{champion:96}}","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-03-08T07:12:41.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't just randomly change status when you're away, what it does is it puts you away then when you come back to your computer it sees that you're back and changes your status to online, Steam does this exact same thing, i agree its annoying though.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-08T07:27:01.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does it while I'm not even using my computer though.
