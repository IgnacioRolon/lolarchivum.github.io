A little like new Sejuani&#039;s passive, after being hit, it remains a little while longer, but much less than it would if not hit.\r\n\r\n_(as well as clearly define what is classified as a &#039;projectile&#039;. as some abilities are blocked and clearly shouldn&#039;t be, Taliyah&#039;s R for example.)_\r\n\r\nThis keeps true to his &#039;fast, action-packed, playmaking&#039; type playstyle, but limits the overbearing utility he brings to teamfights.\r\n\r\nObviously I&#039;m known for being fairly anti-Yasuo, so I have indeed forfeited much of my credibility when it comes to this subject. But this is my &#039;tame&#039; suggestion at least, take from it what you will.\r\n\r\n_Personally id like to see him with mana (or at least energy like Lee Sin), as well as with a slower attack speed offset, and smaller attack range ._ _But I may be hung drawn and quartered for even suggesting such things._","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-08-26T10:24:28.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes you should. Just wait a little while longer, when the base stat boost of runes are gone is is gonna suffer it. Shits fine as it is, but if he really does need tweaking then yes, update what is classed as a projectile. ie, crap like corki's gattling and camille's e should be blocked, but crap like shen's q and taliyah's ult shoudlnt. And decide on whether or not viktor's e is a projectile, it either gets blocked or it doesnt. There is no median. If the line is drawn through the wall it blocks, but if its drawn behind it doesnt get blocked, even though by sheer logic the beam is coming from viktor, so should be positional based not spell location based. Its weird how he can use same spell and be blocked, or use the same spell and annihilate yasuo. \n\nAnd then update bugs with his wall, like velkoz e being destroyed by wall but still knocking up and damaging, if its gonna be a projectile and have the animation destroyed, destroy effect, otherwise remove the animation destroy.\n\n-----\n\nThis part is honestly to throw what you said back at you\n\nPersonally though, I like your idea with some tweaks. It gets hit and its remaining duration set to 50%, but as a plot twist spells that hit the wall get rebounded!!!! ashe stuns right back at her and jinx autos kill her back. That would remove your issue of projectiles disappearing and having no effect at all, cuz the affects now apply... in reverse!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-26T13:39:34.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The idea of rebounding spells is interesting, and certainly would add a new dynamic for the game. But some other part of his kit would have to drastically suffer to keep him from being stupid. and perhaps only the first effect gets rebounded or something.\n\nBut the interactions would feel weird, for example would spells keep their aiming systems? \nWould Veigar's ult heat-seek back to him, or would it just fly out of the wall as a skillshot, 1-hittign the poor ADC who didn't do anything?\nWould Ashe's arrow come out as a skillshot able to hit anyone, or would it shoot back \njust at her?","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-08-30T11:09:33.910+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Problems causes you this does.\n\nHow about it does that 50% duration thing that sounds fun and all, but keeps destroying enemy shit, but plot twist. Yasuo nados duplicate, as in the original will continue as it is, but another one spawns in direct correlation to the first if it passes through the wind wall, using equal angles of reflection and all, so if it hits perpendicular to the wall, another nado will come back perpendicular, but if it hits at say an angle of 45, a new one pops at 45 and continues for the same duration as the original. Activating the duration reduction as it does. If we are honest, it cuts down his blocking power, and give him \"compensation\" that is rarely going to do much good.

You guys treat all low elo like they are absolute cabbages.\n\nIm a silver player, Yasuo would be in my top 20 or so played champions. To my recollection I've never fed this year as him. I hardly play him, _(so I go long times without practice)_ and when I do play him again I have no problems at all. He's way easier to do well with than the champs I usually play.\n\nHe farms stupidly easily, so if you're in a hard lane, just sit back and out farm your opponent. \n\nThe thing is, everyone's always like _\n\"Yasuo goes too ham and dies all the time, so he's balanced!\"_\nDoes Yasuo die a lot by going in when he shouldn't? **Yes.**\nDoes he come out of it with a kill almost every time? **Yes.**\nCan most other champions say the same? **No.**\n\nSo how does dumbly running into certain death, but actually getting something from it, count as him not being broken? If anything that makes him more unbalanced.\n\n\nIf he couldn't get kills like that, he wouldn't do it, but he does, and he can. Where other champions would die instantly and get nothing. So they don't do it.\nThats why Yasuo players 1v3 and die, and Kindred players don't.

I mean if all it takes for Yas to 1v2 is a crit item then it sounds like a pretty solid plan no?\n\nI dont know, maybe the fact that he's _permabanned_ might have something to do with it?\n\nBut I think you misunderstand us, we aren't saying that Yasuo is an instant win whenever you pick him, nor are we saying that theres nothing you can do against him.\n\nWhat we are saying is because of how his kit is set up, with short cooldowns, manaless abilities, and consistent high sustained damage. He has less downtime than other champions, and so more opportunities to recover.\n\nMeaning, when in a fight with champions, if he makes a mistake or misses part of hit kit, he isn't left defenceless, and still has access to the majority of his kit.\nMeanwhile other champs are left more vulnerable when they miss abilities, or make bad plays.\n\nSo in a fight between LeBlanc and Yasuo, if LeBlanc lands 100% of her abilities, she will probably win. However she is hard to play, and hitting a target as mobile as Yasuo isn't an easy task, so if she misses her abilities, she is at his mercy.\n\nHowever if Yasuo misses his abilities, he still has 80% of his kit up at all times, and so can immediately try again. So if both he and LB make mistakes, he can recover while she can not, and the fight turns to his favour.\n\nSo this ability to recover from mistakes, coupled with the fact that both his dash and his windwall, actually cause the enemy to make mistakes. Means that unless his opponent plays absolutely perfectly, Yasuo has the upper hand.\n\nand in lower elo unlike Diamond, people don't play absolutely perfectly all the time. People make a lot of mistakes, so Yasuo consistently gets the upper hand in many of the fights.\n\nBut he also makes mistakes, and so his advantage doesn't always translate into wins. It's just hella frustrating to play against. When you both make mistakes. but you lose and he doesn't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2017-08-28T13:58:33.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The main problem with Yasuo is that it takes so much more ability to exploit his weaknesses than it does to use his strengths, so he stomps at low elo and at around plat people figure him out, and then he's weak.\n\n- So why are you not plat right now by playing Yasuo?

So that also holds me back a lot.\n\nSo there are plenty of factors that keep me in silver, even with a higher knowledge of the game.\n\n> to say a Yasuo can go in 1v1/3 and ALMOST always get a kill is blasphemy lol\n\nAdmittedly, that was probably a bit of an exaggeration on my part to say 'almost every time'.\nBUT in saying that, he comes out with kills a lot more than you'd expect, _(and way more than other champions would)_\n\nMaybe it doesn't happen in your elo, but down here it's a regular occurrence.\n\n> Yasuo has good & bad matchups & can always be shut down by hard CC - just like any other champ.\n\nThis is what gets me, every time.\n_\"Yasuos weakness is hard CC\"_\nOkay, fair enough. \nSol's weakness is also hard CC... and gap closers.... and melee champs...\nAatrox's weakness is also hard CC.... and grevious wounds... and kiting...\nKalista's weakness is also hard CC... and soft CC... and being alone...\n\nSo yes, Yasuo is weak to hard CC _(most of which he can windwall)_, but unlike many other champs, he doesn't have another strong weakness. So he still has less weaknesses than most other champs.\n\n> I'd like to see your yasuo kda too please, if it's above 10 games and less than 4-5 death avg i'll take everything back & you win this argument.\n\nMy summoner name is Itachi Uchiha, feel free to look up whatever stats you want.\nBut like I said, I hate playing ranked, and my days as a Yasuo main came to an end when Azir came out. So there wont be much ranked stats on him certainly not recently, _(Not that there was ever much opportunity to pick him in ranked anyway, it's one of the mid laners roles to ensure there is enough AP on the team, and no one else on the team ever goes AP)_. But if you can find this year's Normal stats, that should put this to rest.\n\nIt's not about winning arguments, it never has been, it's about looking at the situation differently. I give my facts, you give yours, and we both walk away considering things we never thought about to begin with.\n\n> Also proof his statistics are better in low elo?\n\nThe same website that has the rank distribution graph, also has stats on champions, and you can sort the stats by rankings, and Yasuo's stats get progressively worse as you take away the lower elo stats.\n\n\n_______\n\nAlso as a side note, you say that a silver player doesn't really have any credibility when it comes to balance.\n\nI would argue the opposite, the main bulk of players are silver, and when you average out all the ranks, you end up with silver being the middle. So silver is the 'norm' for the game.\nWhatever happens in silver reflects the general feel of the game.\n\nYou see high elo as being 'what you're supposed to be', and low elo being 'bad'. This is not the case. You're not looking at it objectively.\n\nYou as a diamond player make up 2% of the player base.\nSilver players count for 40%.\n\nit's not me thats 'too bad', and you thats 'normal'.\nIt's me thats 'normal' and you thats 'too good'.\n\nThere is no golden standard set by Riot to say _\"below this point is 'bad' and above it is 'good'.\"_ Which means that what is considered 'normal' is decided by statistics and player distribution. And statistics show that low elo _(specifically medium/high silver)_ is the average.\n\nIn other words, I'm not bad at playing your game.\nYou are too good at playing mine.\n\n**So why should I know nothing about balance, when literally most of the game happens at the level I'm at? **\n\nAs opposed to the 2% of the game that happens at your level.\n_(which lets be honest, is pretty much a different game entirely)_\n\n\n__________\n\nSure we look at the pros and think \"Thats what it's supposed to be\". \nBut is it really?\n\nWe watch F1 on TV, but that doesn't reflect the general skill level of all drivers.\nShould we balance the road rules around off duty F1 drivers because they are the most skilled? No, that would kill thousands of people.\n\nSo why should Pro play be seen as the ideal balance situation? When they reflect less than 0.03% of the population's skill.\n\nRemember what 'balance' actually means.\n_\"An 'even' distribution.\"_\n\n'balancing' the scales around just the skilled players, isn't 'balance' at all.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-08-26T14:54:58.551+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jesus you are really stupid, quote where I said exactly that \"Riven is 10x worse for mobility than Yasuo\" that's not what I said.
