Vayne needs 3 aa&#039;s to kill you, so that&#039;s 9 AD less damage she does, now how many times have you escaped a fight from vayne with 9 or less HP? Not very often I bet, and it doesnt make farming much different for her either. But instead of just saying &quot;uhhh dat didn&#039;t work duhhh&quot; let&#039;s think of some ideas that will work.\r\n\r\nI think the most OP thing about her is her passive, the true damage is brutal yes but we all know to run as soon as we get those silver rings, but it&#039;s her passive that makes running impossible.\r\n\r\nSo I think a nerf to the passive is in order. \r\n\r\nAnother option is to give her silver bolts a mana cost, every 3 stacks automatically takes 20 mana from her on the 3rd Attack, this would make it a togge ability instead of a passive, and because you need to turn it on/off it makes 1 more button to press when she fights (just like all the rest of us) this would be similar to Muramana&#039;s toggle ability.\r\n\r\nHer knock back seems to override other dashes, for example if a Lee Sin uses Q to dash to her, if she fires her knock back at him while he is in mid flight he will be knocked back the full distance and not finish his dash, or do the damage. \r\nPerhaps it could be adjusted so that it can&#039;t hit midair targets. \r\n\r\nAnother option is to make her true damage do a flat amount instead of %HP damage \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are some ideas you guys can think of?","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-10-14T22:33:14.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She just has too much 1v1 potential for an AD carry, period.","replies":[{"poster":"Manyula","date":"2015-10-15T00:31:20.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't 1v1 her.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-10-15T00:51:51.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure, don't.

I cant imagine a situation where many other ADCs could realistically 1v5 a whole team. Graves has OK mobility but he'd be pinned down eventually. Jinx could be expected to lock down 2 or 3 with chompers and wail in the rest of the team. Siv would get eaten for breakfast 1v5.\n\nEvery other ADC has some sort of limit to the kite potential and mobility / invisibility.

Jinx is stronger than Vayne in every way, stronger lategame AOE crits, stronger laning. Vayne is a 500range champ jinx is 10x that, positioning with jinx-kun is 10x easier and safer.
