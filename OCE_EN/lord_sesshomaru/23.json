We have an \"achievement\" system similar to the steam item one, where you earn them in game randomly, and then have the option to buy and sell with IP or RP. Some achievements will be rarer than others (e.g only for special events), and are displayed on a special tab on your profile.\n\nMaybe even collecting all the achievements for a certain champion could unlock you a chroma-pack. It might encourage players to spend more RP, while giving poor players with lots of time the ability to earn RP.

You rent something for 1, 3, 5 games and see if you like it, OUTSIDE ranked if you are renting champions, that gives you a chance to try before you buy and a reason to play more, you don't have to spend RP or wait for free weeks for that champ you want to try that is never free.\n\nAlthough if you do that, what do you have to look forward to other than the ladder climb in ranked? You play a lot, try everything with IP, than get bored faster knowing that those champs you thought about are actually not to your style and therefore the IP you could have spent on them, will not be. Than you have more IP just gaining for nothing.\n\nPut community skins in that you can buy for IP, that will give us all something to play for.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-09-11T14:46:40.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can stock up on tier 1 AD glyphs kappa","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkFoxGaming","date":"2015-09-12T05:29:57.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"IP TO RP would be epic","replies":[]}]}
