But as of late I seem to be having more and more trouble with her.\r\nIm not sure wether its because Kat players have finally got their heads around her new kit, or wether its because the meta is shifting slightly in her favour, _(or maybe I&#039;m getting progressively worse)_ but lately there just seems to be very little I can do about her. \r\n\r\nHer kit gives her more chance to screw up than before, its true. But from the perspective of the victim, you often have no idea whats going on, and a good Kat leaves even experienced opponents bewildered.  You see her throw daggers, and shunpo like mad. But everything happens so fast that mid-battle its near impossible to work out her cooldowns. \r\n\r\nHer damage has always been strong, but recently it seems to be off the charts. \r\nIve included a video demonstrating what I mean. _(i know its of the blood moon event, however the changes of that game mode, don&#039;t affect the points I&#039;m making.)_ \r\n\r\nWhen you watch my death in slow motion, my spell shield blocks her dagger, then she shunpos and her blades go off, killing me. \r\n\r\nI had 1400 HP, was killed literally instantly _(one frame)_ by 2 spells only. \r\non top of that, its unclear wether she jumps to me, or to the dagger, as she lands halfway between us _(Clarity?)_. \r\nIf she jumped to me, then she should be out of range of the dagger, and if she jumped to the dagger, then she shouldn&#039;t be standing right next to me. \r\n\r\nThe dagger indicator is also misleading, the red line around the dagger _(I&#039;m assuming)_ is the trigger _(if she crosses that line, the dagger activates)_, but the actual AoE damage is like 3 or 4 times as large, and centres around her, NOT the dagger. So its actually very misleading, you avoid the dagger _(because theres a giant red circle around it)_ and in this game, the logic of red circles usually is: _&quot;You&#039;ll get damaged if you go in there&quot;._ but the damage doesn&#039;t happen around the dagger at all, it happens around her, and theres no indicator for that, and theres no way of knowing where she will land after her shunpo either. \r\n\r\nAll of this makes Kat unnecessarily confusing to fight, unlike someone like Swain who has clearly marked damaging areas. \r\nIt feels wrong to have 2 different kinds of logic in the game, on one hand you fight Swain, who&#039;s indicators are very precise and give both players the information they need to play with/against his spells. And then later in the same game, you fight Kat, who&#039;s indictor is vague and hard to work out, and sometimes works and sometimes doesn&#039;t. \r\n\r\nIt would be nice for everything in the game to be standardised. Either all indicators are clear and state: &quot;Damage will occur inside this&quot;, or they are all vague and say &quot;Damage will occur around this area&quot;. But having both is just confusing for gameplay clarity. \r\n\r\n_______\r\n\r\nNow, back to her damage. Understandably, Kat needs high levels of damage, _(she&#039;s a squishy melee assassin with no CC)_, so its fair enough that her damage should be significantly higher than a ranged bruiser with tons of CC. But regardless, it still needs some form of counterplay.\r\nIn the video it takes her literally 1 frame to do 1400 damage to me, and theres is absolutely no warning at all. No chance to flash or Zhonyas or anything else. One second you&#039;re at over half HP thinking about your next move, the next, your screen is grey. \r\n\r\nThese are the 3 frames it took for me to die:\r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/a/h5GF9\r\n\r\nThe first image is just before she shunpos, you can see that I am well outside the danger zone of the dagger, so in my mind, I am relatively safe _(I am far away from the red circle (which with most other champs, indicates the hazard area))._\r\nThe next frame is her beginning the shunpo _(for some reason the dagger indicator disappears before she gets to it?)_ and the 3rd frame is as soon as she lands. Before any animation effects play at all, my health doesn&#039;t just go red and decrease to zero, it&#039;s just gone! _(in 1 frame it goes from 1400 to not existing)_\r\n\r\nYou can&#039;t tell me that theres counterplay for that...\r\n\r\n________\r\n\r\nIn any case, I have laid out the facts as I see them, and why I think Katarina is a little out of control atm. \r\nThis isn&#039;t just a bitch about a champ thats &quot;broken&quot; or &quot;op&quot;, its a concern about if and why Katarina might have some problems. \r\n\r\nId be interested to know if anyone else is having problems with Kat recently as well. \r\n\r\nPS. Also if someone could explain to me how her Q dagger positioning works that would be great!\r\nIt seems to predict where you&#039;re going to be, and lands right on your path, even if you flash when it hits you, it changes course to land on your path, taking into account the flash distance. If you&#039;re still , it seems to land right on your head, and if you&#039;re moving it seems to predict where you are going to be when it lands, and still lands on your head. \r\nSo if someone could tell me how it is coded to act, and exactly when on its journey it makes the prediction about where to bounce, (eg. does it predict where to land before it hist you, after it hits you, or AS it hits you?)\r\nthanks. \r\n\r\nAnyway, what do you all think of this?","replies":[{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2017-02-27T11:39:05.877+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having played a bit of kat and talon, I think you should of jumped on her and not let the dagger bounce.

It takes a second for her dagger to proc, so as soon as you get hit you should move away from your position, so she can't go to her dagger. All your talk about flash and stuff is merely bad timing, and not noticing. If Katarina throws a Q and it hits a target, it will go behind their current location. As soon as the dagger animation starts (which is also as soon as the Q finishes) you should use your mobility.\n\nYou are never going to beat a Katarina if you are using your ult defensively. While that is the correct move, you seemed to want to go back in afterwards. I know it's the assassin gamemode, but you are focused on her been OP. You should've just ulted and E'd away, you were obviously not going to beat her as she seems very very fed, because it's the bloodmoon gamemode. There are no tanks.\n\nIn a normal or ranked game the Katarina Talon match up is hard anyway, because she can out-roam you and even if you somehow match or increase her power, she can push way faster and make stronger plays with her team. Your safest bet for killing her is getting a CC tank to help you, as she will be forced to focus you but won't be able to kill you while been locked down. Every time she leaves lane you should push, ward deep and watch. If she starts roaming bot, you can either help your JG get damage on tower, or if your JG is bot side, try and countergank and collapse. Whatever happens you don't want to let your ADC get consistently killed while their ADC doesn't die to you because of their pressure.\n\nSadly in an actual 1v1 fight the new Kat is now way stronger, and not as easy to cheese.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-02-28T10:52:38.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went back in becasue I thought i was about to get the blood moon buff, i had 3 stacks and the sound effect started, but i didnt think it would take so long, so she was able to damage me before it activated.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2017-02-27T11:36:44.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder what sort of pet Katarina would own","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-02-27T12:02:53.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Completely off topic to the discussion....","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2017-02-27T13:40:51.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fitzky,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=PLJljYgI,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2017-02-27T12:02:53.242+0000)\n>\n> Completely off topic to the discussion....\n\nI'm not reading an essay length post on a champ perhaps being overtuned lol","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-02-28T03:14:44.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then don't even bother to reply there's GD for a reason....","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-02-27T04:36:56.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"did she blood moon curse thingy you, cuz thats 20% max health true dmg, otherwise, she has same dmg output, except, skill required","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-02-27T04:18:23.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since her q always ends up **behind** the target the best thing to do is to either turn back towards her or sidestep and run in a different direction, remember unless she gets a kill or assist she only has 2 daggers max in her combo meaning she can reset her dash a maximum of 2 times. So unless she has ult all her dmg comes from those 2 daggers (as well as her dashes but their dmg is usually quite low and only used as gap closers). Remember also her w dagger lands where she casts it so getting it to hit you is a bit tricky and requires her to lead you onto her, so yet again the best option to avoid this is to sidestep or stay just out of range (Yes I know its larger then the dagger range appears but that's part of learning it yourself). Katarina herself is mainly about getting resets in team fights which is usually most of the time achieved through dealing a massive amount of damage with her ultimate then finishing off low health targets, at least that's what I always aimed to do. So with her ultimate, yes it deals a lot of damage, yes it happens really quickly, but katarina is an assassin after all. The single best way to deal with this is **Crowd Control**, I find most of the time when facing a katarina that saving CC for when she ults just absolutely devastates her since its her main form of dmg and getting her resets. If your team by chance doesn't have any hard cc, then the best option is to either focus her down as quickly as you can or just get out by any means, even if you have to flash. Remember she usually has to use her dash to get into the team fight to begin with, and unless she picks up another dagger or kills someone, she has no way of getting onto you or escaping, making her completely vulnerable.\n\nSo basically to summarise - If she uses Q, avoid walking in the same direction, if she uses W force her onto you or move back quickly, if she's a problem in team fights focus her down immediately, use hard cc, or just GTFO by any means: unless adc is fed she is going to be the main source of dmg on her team so she will be the only one who can shut you down quick enough, using flash is necessary if you want to stay alive in team fights against her.\n\nI'm not a katarina main, I don't play her often, but from experience this is what I could come up with, hope I helped in some way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wean","date":"2017-02-27T00:25:12.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I faught against Katarina twice in pvp normal game, once using Chogath (mid), in that game I didn't kill her at all, she's too fast.\nThe second time I used Leblanc (mid), and it turns out that Katarina had a tougher time fighting me, but I only killed her once in that matchup, and she killed me more times.\nAs far as I recall, I didn't win either of those games.\nThis does not mean that Katarina is totally unbeatable, getting magic resist items would help reduce the damage that Katarina tries to deal on you, since she deals magic damage mostly.\nFor assassins, just use Zed, or else Leblanc, otherwise use Ekko against Katarina, Akali may be able to lane against Katarina as well.\nFor mages against Katarina I suggest that you use Kennen, Swain may work against her as well, just beware that for these champions, there is a chance for Katarina to outtrade you in level 6, but if you are at least one level ahead of her, you can win against her when she's level 6.","replies":[]}]}
