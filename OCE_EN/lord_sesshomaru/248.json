More bans, skin rental, in game champ swapping, etc etc.\r\n\r\nWhat new feature do you think would benefit league in the long run?

I'm also sick of the one-sided nature of ARURF, i already put up with it enough in ARAM.\n\nTDM/DM modes are more my style, i've never been one to enjoy the idea of teamwork, and objective taking i do it because thats how the game works, but it's not enjoyable, and i'm sure some people would agree with me on the idea of a TDM/DM mode.\n\n(A League RPG and Anime/Movie would be nice)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2019-02-06T05:43:01.967+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Skin previews and a game mode that reverts the game back to Season 1 (graphics, damage, items, buffs etc.).
