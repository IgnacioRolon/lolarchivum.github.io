Hell, I even counted up what her items were supposed to be giving her. Then I remembered that in the short clips showing her abilities she had a slow resist shield that broke after taking damage or something and figured it had something to do with that. \n\n>Frost Armor: Sejuani receives Frost Armor if she hasn't taken damage in the last 9 seconds, lingering for 1 / 2 / 3 seconds after taking damage from enemy champions.\n\n>Frost Armor engulfs Bristle in True Ice, becoming immune to Slow and gains 100 (+ 100% total armor) bonus armor and 100 (+ 100% total magic resistance) bonus magic resistance.\n\nEnds up Frost Armour is a lot like Malzahar's passive, or at least _was_ before it was nerfed. While the shield is up you can't do anything and after it's broken you start swinging. Except that in the late game three seconds is a really long time to be close to 1000 armour, especially when you're diving the backline (which Malzahar usually doesn't do), and you're still going to be tanky afterwards.\n\nWho knows, it's still early days. We haven't even heard the classic \"but you can just kite them\" rebuttal yet so I'm going to hold off on welcoming (back) any tank overlords ; )","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-04T12:51:52.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea that is a long time to be basically immune to damage.\nBut like you say, we will have to see.\n\nIm pretty sure kiting died a long time ago in this game xD. Pretty sure the only champs that can kite now are like Vayne, Draven, Xayah, Lucian and one or two others. Even Kalista and Ashe can't really do it anymore, and hell, there supposed to be the kiting Queens.\n\natm, fighters (which are basically tanks anyway) have so much speed that kiting becomes a near pointless exercise :(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dark Warrior","date":"2017-05-04T04:18:12.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats why i always ban Sej and ask other people to ban if i can't","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-05-04T03:32:33.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy shit, no way that isn't photoshoped, road to 1000 armor confirmed?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-04T03:57:05.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish it was photoshopped :S","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-05-04T03:44:35.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"adc 2017.","replies":[]}]}
