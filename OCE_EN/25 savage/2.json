Only Riot (and only select few Rioters within Riot) knows how they calculate their MMR  and it has never, and probably will never be public knowledge. \n\nYou currently have a negative winrate so your LP gains and losses would be a little bit out from that. Although it looks like you are doing pretty well at the moment so keep it up and it should even out in no time!","replies":[]},{"poster":"PLAYER47","date":"2018-07-04T08:03:26.817+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"oce.op.gg does not reflect your real MMR/ELO rating.
