I find this ridiculous as I had no control over the remake as it wasn&#039;t from my end of the game. How is it fair that I get punished because theres a critical error/bug that hasn&#039;t occurred from my side. Literally just wasted time trying to get into a game to lose 21 LP because of Riots fault.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2018-07-05T06:50:46.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand that you're upset; however, there have to be measures in place in order to prevent abuse and to prevent players from leaving games without penalty.\n\nNo one wants to play a 4v5, and no one wants to go through a series of remakes- which is one of the reasons why a LP loss is a necessary measure. \n\nThis is an opportunity to ensure that your client and computer are able to run the game.
