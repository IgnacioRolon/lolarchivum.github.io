I&#039;ve found myself tilting less, and getting an honour at the end of the game actually feels good now, like someone actually noticed what you did. I haven&#039;t even received any rewards or anything from the new system but it&#039;s making me fall back in love with LoL, with the lack of toxicity in the community. I&#039;d say I&#039;ve probably had less than 1/10 of the old level of toxic people and flamers, and you actually form an (albeit temporary) relationship with your team mates.\r\n\r\nThis is a great new update in my opinion, and I just wanted to say thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-06-16T09:02:10.382+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with this. I've had less toxic people in games. I even had the typical 0/12 support with an adc who was playing ranked for the first time (and had gotten to level 30 just by playing beginner bots) and a top who stood afk under her tower for 4 mins before quitting, but instead of the rest of the team flaming, someone made the call to protect our Master Yi mid and hold out to late game.\n\nIf it weren't for this honour system, everybody would have been toxic and we would have lost. Instead, we joined together and focused on protecting our hard-carry at all costs, and ended up winning.\n\nJust goes to show what a postive mindset can achieve :D\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crymson","date":"2017-06-18T01:59:08.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The new honour system SUCKS!

It's Marauder quoting NaKyle, who goes on to say that Riot is \"trying to nail the right vibe for teammates\" and that \"We've [Riot] got post-launch updates planned to bring back a way to shout out a player from the opposing team.\"\n\n> What happens if everyone on my team (myself included) has a shit game? \n\nThere is a small circular button with a right facing arrow underneath the honours that you can use to skip honours if you feel no one is deserving in a given match. No one is forcing you to give out honours, it is completely voluntary.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-06-18T03:21:46.469+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would just add to this that remember Honor is not about playing well from a skill stand point. Honor is all about being sportsmanlike and having a good attitude. It's meant to be a call out to people who are mentally resilient and stay focused on the game regardless of their actual performance. \n\nThats why the categories are \n\ntilt proof (for someone who's maybe had a bad start but pulled through in the end)\nGreat shot caller (for someone who rallied the team and focused them on the game at hand)\nGG ( for players who were generally a pleasure to play with)\n\nI know they will always be related (attitude and actual performance) but Honor is meant to focus more on the attitude side than performance.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sp1rit Rush","date":"2017-06-17T01:52:11.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also wish we had a view of when we will lvl up our honour rank, I had 3 ranked games in a row when I got Majority and lobby notification and I am still lvl 2","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-06-17T03:31:15.264+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Two points on this.\n\nFirstly, the Honour system is about *consistency*, not necessarily quantity. Getting lots of honours in only a few games will certainly help you level up faster, but you still need to show some consistency in order to actually level up. That doesn't mean you *have* to keep earning honours every game, though.\n\nThe Honour FAQ covers this:\n> **Do I need to do anything special to progress?**\n> Honor levels are all about consistency. Just show up, don't be an asshole, and you'll rise over the coming weeks and months. We have different rewards and celebrations prepared for players who are highly honored in specific games or over the course of a season.\n> \n> **If I get no Honors, do I still level up?**\n> You will, just a little more slowly than those who rack them up like crazy.\n\nSecondly, as for \"having a view of when you next level up\" (or, more simply, a \"progress bar\"), it makes sense that Riot didn't include this, as it would make the system abuse-able by those who want to be toxic yet still want to receive rewards. They could simply change their behaviour whenever they come to close to losing a level. It sucks not being able to track your progress, I agree, but it's better for the community without any kind of progress tracking.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2017-06-21T02:51:25.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a good system but I think honour level of players should be viewable at champion selection, I don't really want to play with anyone who's honor 0, I have met a few and definitely not the type you want to have in a game. I would rather dodge.\n\nI dont think we need to have a progression bar like what most people, otherwise people will just treat honour level as another meta game than actually caring about behaviour.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TOXIKCHODY","date":"2017-06-16T12:28:55.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Although there is a decrease in toxicity, premades just honour each other, it seems like i never get honoured if there's a premade in the game, even if i carry.","replies":[{"poster":"WhiteKimchi","date":"2017-06-17T01:40:17.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This.

I haven't played much since the patch came live, but what I have played has been noticeably more positive. It's good to see the community trying to be better, even if it is just under the condition of being rewarded.\n\nThat said, I've not used it much myself. I find myself racking my brain after each match trying to figure out who (if anyone) I should honour, and most of the time I just haven't thought anyone \"stuck out\" enough for it. Maybe it will be a bit different as I continue to play, or maybe I just don't pay that much attention to what's going on most of the time. Either way, I get the feeling there's a lot of other players who are in the same boat, which isn't the best for the system to reach it's full potential.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Apexslide","date":"2017-06-16T14:20:19.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly, I hate it.
