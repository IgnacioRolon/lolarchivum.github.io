A mic is obviously required and we expect you to be mature, In saying that there is no age requirement but I'm preferring 17+.\r\n\r\nAnymore questions or if you're interested in the position please add me: Hebuska.\r\n\r\nThank you very much.","replies":[{"poster":"4lCH3M15T","date":"2014-12-06T11:58:22.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Added.
