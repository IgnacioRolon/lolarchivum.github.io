He hasn't been in the meta for quite some time, but was always good to watch in the pro leagues and part of the reason I became a spectator of esports. \n\nOthers to consider would be {{champion:106}} , {{champion:3}} , {{champion:32}}  and as mentioned {{champion:20}} .","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-03-28T04:43:41.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good early game Damage, high mobility with his jump.

However down side is gameplay based around Elastic Slingshot and your decision making has to be on point.\n\n{{champion:120}}   i concider to be up there becuse of his potential to chnage fights in a instant and his mobility.\nhe has Good early power,Very strong ganks,Fully AOE skills.High mobility and is fairly Easy to learn , his only real downside is he needs to farm as his builds can be costly and He is out dueled by the popular 1v1 junglers\n\n{{champion:254}}  is a very good all rounder , A lot of cc,Tons of damage,Can be a tank or a good AD /tank hybridr, but Ulty can put you in a bad position,no healing,early ganks are all about hitting your Q , and takes a bit of learning.\n\nthere are a few more like {{champion:72}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:32}}{{champion:48}}   that all have there place but these top 3 i would say make it for the ''tank class ''","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-03-28T23:12:01.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where is \"Rocka\" when you need them?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-03-28T04:02:24.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"except it's not zac, it's Daisy.
