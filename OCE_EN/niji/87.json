We had cool Rioters\n,\n\nI really miss those days, boards isn&#039;t really comparable haha\n&#039;\nMan I really wish boards had more of the oldschool cool posters, can&#039;t say I blame them for moving on tho!\n\nCan&#039;t stay in the past or posting on forums forever I suppose.\nIn time probably the last few of us will leave as well.\nAnyway just a kind of emotional post I had to get out there.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-11-22T10:18:04.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"GD died for me when they made it into an afterthought board, and posts didn't appear on the front page.\n\nYea, they brought it back from the dead after so many people complained about the new boards.\n\nBut it wasn't really a revival, It was just like the boards, or Riot, or whatever, being like: _\"everyone who liked the old forums, can just f*ck off into their own little place that doesn't have to affect the rest of us.\"_\n\nAnd as much as I loved GD _(and I did love it)_, I didn't want to be stuck in a loop of only posting and replying to the same people, because you knew no one new was ever going to listen to what you had to say, the only people who read it were the same people who always read it, and it was just one big family.\n\nAnd while that sounds great, self-reinforcing communities are just sad.\nYou always need new ideas and opinions clashing in order for intelligent growth.\n\nAnd unfortunately that died in GD, because like you say, you knew everyone, and their personalities, and what happened to them.\nYou knew that if you talked about X champion, Y person would say Z. \n\nIt's a sad thing, I really really miss it :(","replies":[]}]}
