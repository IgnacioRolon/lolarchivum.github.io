When I mine end game I do it with a Beacon with Haste/Speed at max level. I usually have my inventory with nothing but ore and minerals in like 20-30 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"Vahnphantom","date":"2018-11-29T02:10:03.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"don't forget, it is always absolutely compulsary to add arrows and diamonds in to your shulker boxes, you never know when you might need to fight them creepers!","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2018-11-30T14:29:26.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vahnphantom,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=qE8JwTAr,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2018-11-29T02:10:03.201+0000)\n>\n> don't forget, it is always absolutely compulsary to add arrows and diamonds in to your shulker boxes, you never know when you might need to fight them creepers!\n\nI have basically my entire storage in Shulker boxes now so yeah I'm fine to set up bases or fight and craft anywhere.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2018-11-30T14:08:09.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay guys I waited out my 3-day ban so here we go.\n\nI fought the Ender Dragon again, got another end island portal, found another end city.
