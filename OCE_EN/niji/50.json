I myself haven&#039;t ever been banned (I think?) so I&#039;m not saying this as some way to justify myself in any way.\n\nI have a friend I play with who has been permanently banned about 30 times by his count. He is extremely verbally toxic but for the most part always tries to win the game and doesn&#039;t intentionally feed or anything. This is my issue with the system at the basic level, the level where bans are split into the two categories of chat bans and game bans.\n\nMy friend and others like him can simply play and go off verbally all game, every game. And very quickly get banned. Him and many others who have been in this situation then just move on to making a fresh account to keep playing. The cycle repeats. In my opinion before a game ban a player should have to go through multiple chat restrictions assuming he isn&#039;t behaving badly in non-verbal ways. This would keep them unable to chew people out but still let them play the game. A few things have happened recently to make this a good avenue of punishment imo.\n\n1) The ping system is now vastly improved so communication can be done entirely with pings.\n\n2) The emote system allows players to let their team know they made a good play etc without the person talking in chat. Also as far as I know it&#039;d be impossible to be toxic with emotes. Sure they can spam the unhappy poppy but that&#039;s vastly different to verbal abuse.\n\n3) The new account levelling system keeps players attached to an account more than the previous system. A lot of these players who are verbally abusive will perhaps rethink their chat usage given the time of longer chat bans as a result of not wanting to lose their account.\n\n4) Same as above now that honour is tied to rewards I feel this could be utilised to curb verbally abusive people. Say if someone got chat banned and had honour set to 0 for the duration of the ban. They would regret not having any rewards in the form of chests/honor capsules etc. Have it so their honour resets to the baseline honour level (unless they were already 0) after chat ban is up. They can then get some rewards but not many. They are more likely to be motivated to move up in honour and learn to not be verbally abusive.\n\nI could name a few more points but they are mostly small. My overall point is that by just game banning verbally abusive people it doesn&#039;t really do much for toxicity when making a new account is free and easy. A lot of these types of players even just buy accounts due to their ban speed not allowing them to hit higher levels quickly or get many champs etc. So in a way banning people so quickly for chat behaviour enables account botters and sellers.\n\nGame restrictions should be more frequently dished out for actual in game behaviours like griefing, trolling or leaving games. Of course Riot would need to improve the ingame behaviour detection (but that&#039;s another thread). Chat restrictions should be for behaviour in the chat. Of course if someone goes through many chat bans and doesn&#039;t improve then start game bans but I feel like people who reach that point are likely invested enough in the game and their behaviour  to just make another account.\n\nI personally think the reason Riot hasn&#039;t overhauled the ban/punishment system is because they like toxic people making new accounts and spending money on rp for boosts, champions and skins. The friend I&#039;ve spoke of has spent thousands possibly on his many accounts even though he knows they get banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2018-01-06T12:01:58.356+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"Players should not lose the right to their account for punishments involving the in-game chat unless it involves sexism, racism, suicide encouragement, or hate speech.\"\n\nUpvote if you agree with this statement.","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2018-01-06T12:28:33.891+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fitzky,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=9o2WdzET,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-01-06T12:01:58.356+0000)\n>\n> &quot;Players should not lose the right to their account for punishments involving the in-game chat unless it involves sexism, racism, suicide encouragement, or hate speech.&quot;\n> \n> Upvote if you agree with this statement.\n\nI'd like to agree on principle with it but I still feel as if account barring people (at least doing it so soon) leaves them no time to reform and just perpetuates a cycle of new toxic accounts that overall results in that person spending more time being toxic than if they were just chat banned.\n\nI'll upvote but I personally feel that from a verbal abuse standpoint a player should get quite a few chat bans before an account ban. Riot could also use the new client and its imrpoved features to drive home the message of reformation and proper chat use with prompts pushed to client that give.\n\nBan escalation clarity\nWhat is or isn't okay\nPositives of refraining from verbal abuse (rewards etc)\n\nAnd so on. I would really like to see some large changes to the way Riot handles negative behaviours.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2018-01-06T09:06:52.175+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because, when people get banned, they make new accounts and buy RP.","replies":[{"poster":"TF Blade","date":"2018-01-06T22:32:34.630+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is exactly what I've been saying.

Are you suggesting that all chat should be used for is making everyone happy? He was playing Draven after all, and as selfish as it may seem to you for him to ask his team to play around him, that may be the only way his team could win the game. After that game, he was then banned for saying \"blahblahblahblah\" after being misleadingly reported.\n\nWhat he said was the lowest level of toxicity, which had reasoning behind it. There are much more toxic players out who have never felt anything of the current report system. As for him, I'm not sure how you could be so focused on criticising someone from doing something so minuscule, which you could easily find in every game of League.\n\nFrustration definitely was a part of what he said, and to me an unban would fit this scenario. He has gone out of his way making posts about his experience being victimised by the system, which most other toxic players wouldn't do especially if they know they're wrong. He doesn't speak out as toxic to me, and given the chance would most likely learn from this and not do it again.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-07T12:35:20.486+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It wasn't his first punishment.
