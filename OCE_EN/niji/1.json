It is effectively blindpick with less arguments and is currently splitting the non-ranked game base into two queues, raising waiting times for no real gain. I'll say what I said before, have one non-draft queue, non-ranked draft (you need the ban/comp practice) and ranked.\n\nWe don't have the player base to support two blind picks as shown by the terrible 30+ minute queues in teambuilder and there is nowhere to practice drafting.\nTeambuilder or blind pick, have one not both.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AgKnight47","date":"2015-02-03T05:21:24.996+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so I really agree with this and I hope riot looks at this and at least considers it.\nBlink pick and team builder are basically the same thing except that team builder is better for the community.\nIn blind pick if someone else picks  a silly pick (lets say heimer jungle) and you don't like it, you either dodge or play the game, dodging in that case is toxic, you are punishing everyone who is in the lobby because you don't want to play by forcing them to re-que. Where as in team builder you can just leave and everyone who's ok with the pick stays, everyone wins.\nThe above idea is basically the best of both worlds, its very seldom people don't go into a que with out any idea of what lane they want to play and just add a fill for people who don't care.\n\njust my opinion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-02-02T08:21:49.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"then bring back fu.cking draft pick \n\n\nit will be set","replies":[]}]}
