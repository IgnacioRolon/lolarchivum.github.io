I know towers aren&#039;t supposed to be islands of invulnerability but watching bruiser/tank champs walk under the tower like it is nothing killing someone from full health and walking out after taking tonnes of shots with half health is really annoying and doesn&#039;t make sense thematically. Towers are supposed to be massive strong constructs but they just feel so weak compared to what they look like.","replies":[]}
