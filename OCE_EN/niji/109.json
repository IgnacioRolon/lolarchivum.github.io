Why the hell did Riot even add an armoured bear to the league??? Preposterous!\r\n\r\nNot only is his design lacking but his kit is way OP!!!! Last game I had to verse one toplane and he went 10/0 before 10 minutes. My team raged at me but it wasn&#039;t my fault. I can&#039;t even kite this bear because he moves as fast as sonic the hedgehog (I really liky sonic btw he is so cool and fast but fk volibear he is g). Anyway I legit have no idea how to fight this cancer {{champion:106}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:106}} \r\n\r\nI won&#039;t be surprised when the pros catch on and he dominates LCS.
