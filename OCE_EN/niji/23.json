It'd be nice if they had a better support team I know they must get a lot of  tickets but even so week+ delays on replies is ridiculous I think they need to hire more people (as in not copy-paste bots) to improve the quality of service.","replies":[{"poster":"Ludi","date":"2014-11-25T05:44:41.391+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't know what your doing wrong but when my account was hacked, OCE riot support helped me with the problem and fixed it within 24hrs.\n\nStill better than EA :3","replies":[]},{"poster":"MadLifeJunior","date":"2014-11-24T21:57:44.006+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey there RainbowWindslash,\n\nPlease be understanding of Riot and it's staff. With the recent release of a patch 4.20 and the development of so much new game content I'm sure Riot are all hands on deck ATM. Please just be patient and I'm sure you'll get the response you need in due course. In addition, Riot are also working on a new version of the Tribunal everyone has been so desperately after. I'm sure that once it's completed everything will calm down a tad.\n\nKind Regards,\nlols =)","replies":[{"poster":"P1 GTR","date":"2014-11-25T02:33:05.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":":^)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BrbDoingWraiths","date":"2014-11-25T07:51:23.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe that they will deal with the ticket in less than around 3 days.
