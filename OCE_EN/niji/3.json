Thing is pretty much none of us had consistent/constant connection issues playing on other servers, the problem was relatively high ping, which was manageable. Hell even my friend, who got me into the game, has a good enough internet connection to play on other servers, and it's a pretty cr*p connection.

What I am talking about in this post is not people with a bit of lag but people who disconnect regularly for significant amounts of time and still play knowing this which is basically the same as afking in my opinion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HVZ Watch Tower","date":"2015-02-01T09:37:22.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"We;re Aussies with as a whole sh itty internet and a government that still wants to put us back into copper piping speeds where South Korea is projected to have 1 GB a second dl inside the next few years.
