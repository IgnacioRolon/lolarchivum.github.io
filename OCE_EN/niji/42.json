A lot of people are saying certain derogatory terms and such towards me in game. When I proudly tell them I voted yes on gay marriage first thing when I load in. They all start being really really TOXIC and then it makes me super depressed to the point I almost consider suicide. I try to tell them to stop because I am considering but then they just tell me to do it. WOW! WHAT THE HECK!\n\nFirst and foremost guy on guy love is probably way more pure than whatever you have you little keyboard warrior. While you are flaming me in game I am carrying my team to victory holding the banner. \n\nIn fact I would like riot to add an emote like the white flag one but RAINBOW. Then I imagine me running out of the jungle coming for you TOXIC HOMOPHOBE. It will be a drag once I tag you for a goldbag, you will claim lag but really have nothing but rags compared to my flag MY FLAG MY GAY PERSON FLAG! (still thinking on a name for the emote)\n\nPls seriously Riot haha good work so far banning these people but we need more done haha pls like and leave suggestions ty also add me on league of legends and we can erp and I can carry you with my jg.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-12-05T20:07:21.683+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know the easiest way to avoid prejudice online?\n\nJust don't bring it up in the first place.\n\nI don't join a game and say \"I'm a straight white male with no religious affiliation\".\n\nIt's not that people are actually homophobic, racist, anti-whatever religion you might be, it's the internet so people like to be contrary.\nI could say something like \"I like dogs\", and I know someone is going to reply with \"you're stupid, cats are better\" or some bestiality comment, because that's just how the internet is.\n\nDon't bring up your sexuality and no one will make fun of it.\nI don't go around screaming \"I like big titties!\", so why do others have to tell me they like penis?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-05T21:04:26.264+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's the same with the whole \"i'm a girl\" thing that people do, no one fucking cares, it's the internet, and we hate you for being you, regardless of sex/sexual preference, don't bring it up, don't get ridiculed, if you feel the need to bring it up every game, unbind your fucking enter key.","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2017-12-08T10:11:35.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=E8Vo4lzK,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2017-12-05T21:04:26.264+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s the same with the whole &quot;i&#x27;m a girl&quot; thing that people do, no one fucking cares, it&#x27;s the internet, and we hate you for being you, regardless of sex/sexual preference, don&#x27;t bring it up, don&#x27;t get ridiculed, if you feel the need to bring it up every game, unbind your fucking enter key.\n\nYeah its as as simple as that.

Riot has a 0 tolerance of homophobia, so if this is genuine hate for gay people then they will take action against it, and so they should! That behaviour is unacceptable anywhere.\n\nBut everything has its time and place, you cant poke a bear and then complain about it mauling you. \nEven though the bear is in the wrong in this situation, you could have avoided the whole situation with some common sense.\n\nLoading into game and announcing to the world your sexuality without provocation, is just not a normal thing to do. Sure you do _(and should)_ have the right to, theres nothing wrong with your sexuality. But regardless of what team you play for, that behaviour is just neither relevant, nor appropriate for the situation.\n\nFor example, there is nothing wrong with gaming, we are all gamers here and that doesn't make us any less of a person. However if I walk into a club, sit down next to a pretty girl and say _\"Yo. you ever heard of Azeroth? Im a mage!\"_ I will not be leaving with a pretty girl on my arm. Does that make gaming wrong? No, but it is inappropriate for the situation.\n\nTheres a time and a place for everything, and in league people come to have fun, they don't want whatever baggage you have regarding your sexuality. So when you proudly announce it to them, they probably will react badly, not because they disapprove of your sexuality, but because they just want to play a game without someone shoving it in their face.\n\nI personally don't see the need to be all proud and showy about it? Why do you need a flag? Im straight, Im not necessarily proud of it, it's not an achievement or anything, it's just the way I am, I accept it and get on with my life. I fail to see how gay people are any different. Why do you feel the need to tell everyone? I don't announce my sexual/political/religions preferences whenever I start a game.\n\nIm pretty sure it'd be a hate crime if there was a straight pride flag.\nHow's that for equality?\n_____________\n\nWhat I'm trying to say here, is that theres nothing wrong at all with being gay, but it is irritating when someone shoves their beliefs or baggage on you, thats why Jehovah's witnesses aren't popular, its not that people don't like the religion, people just don't like randoms showing up in their private space and preaching about how you're wrong.\n\nSo if you want to just have en enjoyable game of league, play league, no need to bring anything else into it. Thats what we are all here for after all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-12-05T22:59:47.968+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Niji, I don't hate you for being gay, I just dislike you for your attitude.\n\nAssholes are assholes, regardless of sexuality, race, religion, etc.\n\nIf I pretended an asshole wasn't an asshole, just because they are gay/black/Muslim/whatever, that would make me an asshole.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrgpZ0fUixs","replies":[]},{"poster":"Matsuzaka544","date":"2017-12-06T11:02:00.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol instead of rainbow flags,riot should make a huge emote that says \"TRAPS AINT GAY\"\n\nlmao","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2017-12-06T11:04:32.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Matsuzaka544,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=E8Vo4lzK,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2017-12-06T11:02:00.486+0000)\n>\n> lol instead of rainbow flags,riot should make a huge emote that says &quot;TRAPS AINT GAY&quot;\n> \n> lmao\n\nHaha wow I agree!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Psylock1234","date":"2017-12-06T06:33:24.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have a friend on lol who always says bby(sorry fearthebomba if your reading this) and its kinda weird cos we are both males so now when ever he says it i say #nohomo","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-12-05T13:30:54.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like rainbows.
