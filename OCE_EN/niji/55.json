Also not many people can play Azir, Fiora, and Poppy extremely well like they do with Nid. I have seen many good nid players but few good Fiora, or poppy players.\n\nI think it is because people can master her fairly easy and do decently most games. Cass is pretty Op like always but to position her in teamfights without getting blownup is really hard, so high  risk and high reward champion also her damage is sustained and not burst like Annie. So Cass is pretty balanced champion. On the other hand,  Nid can be positioned easily. I agree Kassadin and Jayce is broken op and needs a nerf hammer.  Same goes to Annie and Azir. Azir late game damage is godly, the most broken shiet I have ever come across in league. Thresh is broken op too, but not many people can play as she needs to be played.\n\nAnother broken duo Que is Kalista and blitz, if blitz can continuously land the hooks then, Kalista can one shot the enemy bot lane. But that too is balanced with the requirements of high coordination, communication and mechanics.\n\nNid is pretty broken if she is played the way she is meant to be. Poke from a safe distance, bait the enemy CC and summoners and profit. Also make sure Nid is picked into a decent team comp. \n\nLike you said her spears are fairly easy to dodge, but in poke and mobility compositions where she can distract the enemies and keep them occupied while other team members get the towers or other objectives.","replies":[{"poster":"Ungnyeo","date":"2015-02-09T22:48:20.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you said at the end would never happen in  SoloQ and in 5v5 team play teams would know how to play around it if they didn't Nid would be 100% pick/ban but she isn't","replies":[{"poster":"godsmustbecrazy3","date":"2015-02-09T23:14:56.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Winter Fox,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=V7KFK85s,comment-id=00030000000000000000,timestamp=2015-02-09T22:48:20.028+0000)\n>\n> What you said at the end would never happen in  SoloQ and in 5v5 team play teams would know how to play around it if they didn't Nid would be 100% pick/ban but she isn't\n\nYou got more exposure than me on this game, I would take your word for the truth. Nid still has lots of potential to create pressure all across the map with her mobility especially in the jungle. That is what you call as annoying.  She makes the enemies react to her moves/plays rather than enemies making their own plays. She can get lots of either coverage/control of the map in less time at all points of the game, when compared to other champs. At the end of the day, whoever make the enemies dance to their tunes has an upper hand and most likely win the game. Every strategy has it own weakness and flaws, but whoever executes them better than the other team , wins the game. it is not champions fault if the people who play her don't use her the way she is meant to be. Maybe that is why they gave nid the good jungle buff, knowing she got the potential to get control of the map, at-least through ward coverage and make some plays. Or people still have not realized her full potential, it is easy to play Nidalee that does not mean anyone has completely mastered her. As I said before, at the end of the day, you got more exposure on this game than me, so you know better.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"godsmustbecrazy3","date":"2015-02-09T16:53:33.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Winter Fox,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=V7KFK85s,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-02-09T05:06:13.738+0000)\n>\n> It's not a problem they're not as strong as they use to be and incredibly hard to hit compared to what the speed and width use to be.\n> \n> Mid Nidalee literally sucks in team fights unless shes super ahead\n> \n> The only thing that's broken about NID imo is jg nid being able to trigger passive on jg creeps idk why Riot decided to do that\n\nShe is useless if she keeps missing the skill shots.
