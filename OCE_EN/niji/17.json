Its when you start throwing losses in there that the calculations get fuzzy. Going 9-1 is very different from 10-0 (apparently).\n\nI've heard people going 7-3 and getting in a lower division then they ended last season in. People going 5-5 and getting higher. Theres just a lot of confusion since Riot would rather say Bronze 2 or Silver 3, instead of 1200 elo and 2000 elo etc... actual numbers so people can see the MMR changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-01-21T09:31:15.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"somewhat, they affect where you're placed at the start. anyone that deserves to rise will.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-01-21T09:01:04.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well if that's the case I might just not play ranked this season lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-01-21T08:59:36.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That seems to be how it is from all of the 'qq riot your placements are a joke' threads","replies":[]}]}
