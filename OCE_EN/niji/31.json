There millions of players playing League every day with at least 5% submitting support tickets. Regardless of how much staff Riot has I believe it would be impossible for them to personally respond to every support ticket submitted. If your support ticket is a simple task that can be answered using a automated response then that will have to suffice. But if it's a more complicated matter. Then unless the ticked says resolved or whatever system Riot uses to close it's tickets. Please be patient. Even if a automated response is given. A ticket case is not solved into said otherwise by the ticket case status. \n\nRegards,\nFog","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-02-08T21:49:00.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fog,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=QheYUxve,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-02-08T21:28:15.612+0000)\n>\n>If your support ticket is a simple task that can be answered using a automated response then that will have to suffice. \n> \n> Regards,\n> Fog\n\nThe issue I have seen with automated responses is they just scan for key words and then give the generic response for those few key words I have seen people send in tickets like \"My account was banned \" etc yet due to the way they worded it the response was something about the in game store or something ridiculous like that.","replies":[{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-02-08T22:37:24.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's basically how an automated response works.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dathma450","date":"2015-02-08T08:12:04.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes I would like to know how many blitzcranks they have working at rito","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-02-08T08:48:31.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dathma450,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=QheYUxve,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-02-08T08:12:04.150+0000)\n>\n> yes I would like to know how many blitzcranks they have working at rito\n\nWell they always say they have maintenance golems working on the problem.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-02-08T08:32:40.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they're all real people that own the accounts, they just use copy-paste responses.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-02-08T04:38:28.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well theres... um yeah him and her and him...","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-08T04:38:37.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hint: when you get a copy paste response, reply to it.","replies":[]}]}
