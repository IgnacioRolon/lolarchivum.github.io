The people who desperately try to solve the issues have by no means sufficient time or man power, while the others just keep producing more and more disasters for their own profit and tossing the aftermath to those poor dudes who spend their entire life studying and practicing arse wiping when they could be doing something else truly great easily with the knowledge they possess.\n\nBefore we place the eyes onto the stars, we should really think about the ground we're now standing on.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
