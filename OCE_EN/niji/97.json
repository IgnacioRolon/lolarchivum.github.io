My team yelling in all chat for me to be reported for trolling and intentional feeding when I was legitimately trying and had one of the better scores on my team. Of course at the end I got the usual stupidity of people thinking they could actually get me punished for this and of course I got the automated warning bs stuff but I know that even if I did get auto banned one quick message to support would see them realize it was just because of false reports. I have said it once and I&#039;ll say it again meta breaking isn&#039;t reportable I could go AD Ryze and roam the enemy jg all game as long as I am trying to win and using pings I ain&#039;t breaking any rules.","replies":[]}
