I'm sure they're mustbe somewhat connected but a lot of people play pretty much just Ranked games. As a result even if they are Diamond in Ranked they may only have 200 or so Normal wins so their MMR wouldn't be that high for normals. Also just unlucky if they're queued with some Bronze, they can't play Ranked with their Bronze mates so they have to play normals, I'm sure you'd be getting some on your team too just unlucky if you're laning against one.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-02-01T13:49:23.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ Tis the correct answer","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-02-02T09:50:25.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just learn from them, or destroy their boosted asses.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yuriklatura","date":"2015-02-02T04:52:15.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get put with about 2 golds every game, quite often a plat or two, it just means you wreck in normals.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yolo Babaduchi","date":"2015-02-01T11:12:48.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is possible that you are at their skill level.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pentakiruuu","date":"2015-02-01T08:18:20.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Diamonds are 9/10 trash anyways, just destroy them.
