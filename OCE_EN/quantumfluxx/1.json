No matter how bad the player is at him, they can still end up carrying the game. 0-3 in lane. Never mind got statikk shiv 152-3. The only players that say he is in a balanced spot are the people who main him. And thats like any person who mains a champ thats op. &quot;Aww nah they are balanced they just require skill&quot; - BULLS#!T! \r\n\r\nEver since this champ came out every Tom, Dick and Harry has played him mid and top lane. There is a reason for this Riot! He is STRONG. Yeah get a bit of cc on him and he is toast. But you get that one other champ on your team who can do a knock up (with the yasuo quietly jerking off out of sight) and its just a free penta for him. \r\n\r\nSo god damn sick of the amount of &quot;skill&quot; required to get quads or pents with him. Its virtually 0. You wait for you team to do the work. Wait for the knock up, and then you find he is poking his BULLS#!T range sword in every crevasse known to man. \r\n\r\nWTB Nerfs or Changed plox.","replies":[]}
