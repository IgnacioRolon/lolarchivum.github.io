Have been higher in other seasons etcs. However, im getting back into the swing of things and i won 13 games in a row. That then threw my MMR threw the roof and now im vsing mid level plats. How is this a fair match?! Yes im obviously better than my current rank. But that doesnt mean to throw me against people 2 ranks above me. Low silvers should vs high bronze and high silvers.  High silvers vs low silvers and low golds. and so on. Not 1 silver in a game of 5-6 mid level plats and high golds. Thats just rubbish. Not only is it unfair on myself. But also my team who is then having to pick up the slack.

But in matchmaking I've had a Bronze on my team or the enemy team and I am in Gold. To me that doesn't seem right and regardless of MMR they generally get stomped. It most cases an enemy team or my team might have someone unranked and then someone like a Gold 1 where everyone else is Silver 1/Gold 5 and it really doesn't even out anything. \n\nThe unranked player feeds and now the Gold 1 player who queued as support has to out carry the Gold 5 Fizz on the enemy team. If that makes sense to anyone at all? That's how I mostly lose. I lose because of people feeding so incredibly hard that it is impossible to out carry a snowball before 20 minutes and at that point they've already pushed to the base towers.\n\nI only want to be matched with people in my division with the roundabout same MMR and none of this BS where one gets an unranked/bronze and a platinum to even the match versus all silvers and golds. That platinum player just snowballs early because he's vs someone a tier below him/her. This is what frustrates me about this game.\n\nNever have I played so many games where they have been one sided with people going 0-14 or 0-9 .. the matchmaking isn't balanced at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-07-20T13:40:06.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is no thanks to the queue changes they made to cater for their precious Masters and Challengers rank, 10 points if you can guess what that change was.\n\nIf your MMR is higher than it should be, true you should be vs'ing those of a higher MMR, but since the queue system cannot match your own MMR with others in the appropriate rank, instead of placing you with those in your current or a lower rank, it takes those in a higher rank than it should so it can 'balance' itself out.\n\nIt is fair in Riot's eyes, and fair enough if you are a gold level player you should not be vs'ing those in Bronze.\n\nBut now let's look at the flip side, this means those in Platinum now have to face a Silver because the matchmaking system cannot place you anywhere else, which means if you get a Bronze 5 who just won 10+ games because they left rank, got good and started to win, it will be the exact same situation, they will be matched with you since the MM system cannot put them anywhere else and than you will be coming back here to complain the exact same.\n\nRant over, the MM system sucks balls and it is all due to the dynamic queue system they put in place, yet they refuse to change it. You get players like yourself who get matched with others 2 leagues higher, and soon you will be getting matched with those 2 leagues lower, or you will get stuck with players in your rank who have no idea and shouldn't be at that rank who will suck complete ass and drag you down for a free lose that shouldn't be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-20T12:03:27.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here.
