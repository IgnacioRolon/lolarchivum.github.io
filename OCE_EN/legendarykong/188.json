This video is the second episode of a series about jungling in season 9. these kinda videos take a lot of time and effort so i will only upload another episode if you guys are interested in such a series. so make sure to hit the like button and leave a comment below the video what exactly you learned from the video and what you would like me to talk about in the next episode. if you missed the first episode make sure to check out the link in the comment section\r\n\r\nSo this episode will be about jungle paths. because the jungle can change from patch to patch and its constantly evolving you gotta always adapt to the situation. this is the reason why i will start this video by showing you guys some standard clears you alwas can do and they basically never change. later on i will show some advanced jungle paths.","replies":[]}
