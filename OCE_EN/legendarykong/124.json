Well, Yuumi is relativily easy to learn and straight forward. She is a great Teamfighter because of her utility she provides, with all the slows, roots, heals and movementspeedbuffs and her abilities are easy to learn and incredibly easy to pull off. She has a strong ultimate, that not only root the enemies, also damaging them. She then can become untargetable as long she is attached to her allies. Means she can not be targeted for the entire game if you want to. Also with her passive she can restore mana and gain a shield just for autoattacking enemies. However Yuumi is a very squishy Champion. She really needs to be near an ally champion, so she can attach to them and get untargetable. Also her damage is really low. you might think its higher but is really not.\r\nFor your runes you pretty much focusing on increasing your sustain and damage as much as possible so your poke on lane hits hard. You wanna go for Sorcery on the first and resolve on the Second Path.\r\nWhen it comes to the Keystones you should go for Summon Aery. You can proc Summon Aery very easy with your long range Q Ability once you are attached to your ally. It adds even more utility to your kit and a lot of people are gonna be pretty annoyed by that.\r\nSince Yuumi pokes a lot with her Q and heals with her E, you will be wasting a lot of mana so it absolutely makes sense to grab manaflow band as the next rune. It stacks up your mana and even restores your mana by 1% of your missing mana every 5 seconds.\r\nAs Yuumi you will be building a lot of support/utility items and exactly these items grant cooldownreduction. Having ten extra cooldownreduction at level ten makes life easier. also excess CDR becomes AP!\r\nAs the last Rune on that Path you wanna take Scorch. Every ten seconds your first ability hit burns enemies and this will actually add even more poke to your kit.\r\nAs i mentioned before, you wanna focus on increasing your utility power and your poke damage. This is why you take \"revitalize\" on the Resolve Path. Heals and shields are 5% stronger and increased by an additional 10% on low health targets.\r\nLast but not least you should take \"Font of Life\". Impairing the movement of an enemy with your Q, marks them. Your allies then heal when attacking champions you have marked.\r\nFor the other three mini runes you should go for CDR on the first one, Adaptive Force on the second and last but not least, health on the third one!\r\nFor your first summoner spell you should pick up ignite. This is a required summoner spell on Yuumi because it increases your killpressure a lot and it is much easier with it to snowball the lane.\r\nThe second summoner spell should be exhaust. Exhaust is really effective against a high damage lane and in general its good against high dmg champs like Tryndamere later on in the teamfights. With that spell you can slow them down and they are much easier to kill.\r\nThe summoner spell Flash is here not needed. since you can jump back and forth between your allies and you become untargetable by doing so, you dont need Flash.\r\nFor your Skillorder you first wanna put a point into \"Q\" and maximize it first for high damage and high slow. Then you wanna move on to your \"E\" Ability and max it next to your Q Ability. This ability is important to heal your lane partner. also you increase his movement speed. so the more points you put into that ability, the more effectiv your heals are. Her W is given from the beginning and you put just one point into that early on. you pretty much ignore it after. Of course you should put a point in your ultimate whenever you can, means at six, eleven and sixteen.\r\nYour combo is pretty damn easy to pull off on Yuumi. All you have to do for the easiest combo is to attach to one of your ally, press Q and make sure to gain one second before you hit them, so you can slow them and then make sure to hit them at least with three waves out of seven of your ultimate.\r\nHowever you wanna take care while attaching and deattaching with an ally, because you can get cc´ed during the animation and a deattached Yuumi is squishy and therefore easy to kill.\r\nLets move over and see what champions are good with Yuumi. the first champ i wanna mention here is Ezreal. Ezreal can just like Yuumi poke people from far behind. Even tho if enemies are gonna be hiding behind minions, as Yuumi you can just bend your Q arround the minions and poke them out that way. Another point is that whenever you or Ezreal is in trouble, ezreal can simply use his E Ability to get out of spicy situation and so you.\r\nAnother champion that Yuumi synergizes pretty well with is Miss fortune. Miss fortune can poke through the minions by hitting the minions and then the enemies. means even tho if the enemies hide behind minions, MF can hit them super easy. Also if you manage as Yuumi to hit at least three out of your seven waves on your ult, Miss fortunes ult will hit for sure. this ult combo can be very scary and the enemies should take max care.\r\nThe last champion i wanna mention here is Xayah. Xayah can also poke through minions with her fethers and snare them even which makes your Q easy to land. Also her ult is easy to pull off and can be super good combined with the Yuumi ult. it makes hitting three waves really easy and the enemies will be staying on one point for years. Yuumi is really good in any poke comb but really bad against hard engaging support champs like Leona. so you wanna take care when to pick Yuumi and when not.\r\nDuring the laningphase your main focus should be on poking out your enemies by using your Q ability while you are attached to your ally, so you can move the projectile with your mouse cursor. And then deattache and autoattack the enemies to utilize your passive. that is all you gotta do. you repeat the whole process over and over until you can kill the enemy. Make sure before you ward a bush to use your Q in order not to facecheck that bush. Also Yuumi is most effective when she is paired with an ally, so roaming is not really an option. Yuumi is all about enhancing your ally, so stay next to your ADC and do your job.\r\nLater on when the teamfights are about to happen, you wanna try to stay attached to your carries as much as possible so you can enhance them. Also you should deattach and attach to the ally that needs the enhancement. However, as i mentioned before you wanna take care by doing so. Once you get cc´ed trying to attach to someone, you will get knocked out of the attach animation and your spell goes on Cooldown and you are basically dead. Make sure to deattach in the right moment, means if you see your ally is going to be in a sticky situation, you dont wanna follow him and die aswell. so make sure to deattach and attach to someone else before its to late.\r\nAllright now let´s finishes off with the itembuild. That starts of course with the spellthiefs edge, two healing potions and a warding totem.\r\nFor your Corebuild i suggest you to build you Ardent Censer and redemption. You will get 20% CDR from these Items , a lot of mana regen, which makes poking much easier and consistent, health regen and even 60 AP, which also makes your poking much more effective.\r\nThe only bootsoption you have on Yuumi is Boots of mobility. You dont really need the other boots with all the defense stats since you are most of the time attached to your allies. Means you cant get targeted anyways. Its more like you need to be fast while attaching and deattaching between your allies.\r\nNow let´s have a look what items are good in general on Yuumi. since Yuumi is all about utilizing your allies, you could go for all the utility items. However if you wanna focus more on poking down your enemies you can grab some ap items like morellos. this item not only increases your Ap, it also provides you 20 percent CDR, which makes poking super consistent.\r\nFor my example Full Build tho i would take that Corebuild then add Locket of the iron solari, remnants of the watchers and a mikaels. With that build you will have a lot of utitlity to provide. you will be able to heal a lot and poke a lot with all the mana regen you get out of ardent censer, redemption, remnant of the watchers and mikaels. The Locket of the iron Solari grants a decaying shield to nearby allied champions and even yourself for up to 2,5 seconds, absorbing up to 45-300 damage.\r\nBut that´s everything i´ve got for Yuumi Support.
