I&acute;m pretty sure you guys heared about the upcoming Duskblade nerf and the wukong buffs and i would like to cover it in this video. But before i will say something about the current situation of league of legends and the current meta. There are four things i really do hate at the moment, that is ninja tabis , thousend million shields, the broken stopwatch and tanks, who build full tank but still outdamaging an assassin. And this is for like 2,5 seasons going like this. As assassin you can do shit in teamfights because of the heavy cc of tanks and you cant oneshot adc&acute;s (that is your mission btw) because they build ninja tabis and receive shields from everything and everyone. Dude, you cant even oneshot supporters anymore, later in the game. With all these problems assassins have, riot even nerfs the duskblade to make it even harder to do your job as an assassin in the current fuckin shit tank meta. And so many players are quitting League at the moment just because of that meta. And i think it was yesterday when i saw on twitch, that fortnite had more viewers than League. The reason for that is, playing league these days is very very stressful and essentially its not fun!","replies":[{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2018-03-09T23:47:04.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Almost like wukong is getting compensation buffs since dusk blade is getting nerfed","replies":[]}]}
