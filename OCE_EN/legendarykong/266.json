Scuttle has received a massive xp buff from 10 to 115 till 230 xp scaling throught the game. This sounds very op and many people are focusing on killing these scuttles throughout the game. however the first Level 1 scuttle is just another gromp. I know the scuttle don&acute;t fight back and gives you vision, but xp-wise its the same. So the very first scuttles are not that strong and don&acute;t forget about the fact, that taking scuttle negativly effect your pathing later on. But the following spawns are very powerful and you should try to take them. \r\n\r\nWith that being said, lets talk about champions that can easy take them and fight for them.\r\nOf course on that list is xin zhao. he is one the op picks in this patch because of his massive strong early game. With him you can easy fight for the scuttles take camps away. However there are champs that are good in ganking and invading and there are champs for efficient farming. pick one of that champion out of the list and you are good to go. For all the wukong players, well ofc wukong is not on that list, yikes.\r\n\r\nOnce you got your champion ready to go you need to know how to path and how to clear in this patch. if you pick an early ganking jungler like xin zhao i recommend you this pathing that gives you level three arround two minutes and fifteen seconds. if you wanna go for an early gank at level two you can go for this path here.\r\n\r\nfor all the players who wanna chill a little bit and farm up in the early because they picked a farming champ i recommend this path to take. it a very efficient clear that potentially allows you to grab scuttle.","replies":[]}
