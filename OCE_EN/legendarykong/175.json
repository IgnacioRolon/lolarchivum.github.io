I mean, maybe they dont know what to do with Wukong. So we gotta help these guys out. However, this will be my solution for Wukong and i would love to read from you guys. So feel free to critizies my concept and also i would be very interested in your concept of a new Wukong. So leave me your concept idea in the comment section below. Also i wont talk much about numbers. i will throw some numbers here and there, but they are not that important. Dats Riots job to figure out how much cooldown each spell should have or how much damage it should do. Your focus should be on the ability itself. So if you wanna give me some feedback on my concept, dont come at me like, ey 1000 Range on his Q is to much. ok, just focus on the abilities.\r\nAnyways guys, lets start right away with his passiv.\r\nThe name of his passive will be the journey to the west. Wukong&acute;s presence causes Bananas to appear at random locations for up to 10 minutes. Collecting a banana permanently grants Wukong 0.75 bonus AD and 0.75 AP and 100 bonus movement speed for 2.5 seconds. So on the map it will look like this and whenever you collect one of these bananas you will get these stats i was talking about.\r\nHis next Ability is his Q Crushing blow that is a target point ability in which Wukong slams his staff on the ground, stunning enemies in a line and damaging them with a critical hit based on his attack. The cast range on that ability will be 800. Passiv: Reduces his target&acute;s armor for 5 seconds. \r\nWukong is now able to poke from far behind and with the five seconds armor shred he has enough time to decide wether he goes in with his E or not. Poking from that distance sounds op, i know, but keep in mind that the hitbox of that spell is very thin and has a cast time. Enemies will be able to dodge that spell. also ganking is very effective with that ability. you can start with your Q from a bush and follow up with your E ability. In the lore Wukong can grow his staff to a gaint super staff. so this way we got a bit from the lore into our league of legends wukong.\r\nHis W Ability, Decoy Master, is a point click ability which will briefly vanishes Wukong from the battlefield for one second. In that one second you will be able to dodge projectiles. After 1 second, Wukong appears and with him two illusions at a random position within the targeted location. These illusions will do 25% magical damage per hit.\r\nOnce again i got inspired by the lore where Wukong creates illusions of himself by throwing away some of his hair. Even jungling would be super good on Wukong with that spell. This way Wukong could clear camps faster and stay longer in the Jungle. \r\nHis E Ability Nimbus Strike allows Wukong to dash to the target enemy and gain Attackspeed for 4 seconds. Within these 4 seconds, the attackspeed of his illusions is increased aswell.\r\nPassiv (Wuju-Style): Upon the fourth hit on the same enemy Champion, Wukong earns four charged attacks that have bonus damage and lifesteal.\r\nThe name of his Ultimate Ability is KingKong. It&acute;s a point and click ability where Wukong jumps forward within a range of 500. Upon impact, Wukong deals magic damage to all nearby enemies and knocks them up for 0.75 seconds.\r\nWhile he jumps, he turns into Kingkong for 4 seconds. While in Kingkong form, Wukong gains base AD, base health, base armor and base magic resistance. \r\nYe thats pretty much my Concept for a new Wukong. I think playing a Wukong like that can be a lot of fun. You could build Wukong in many different ways. Like imagine Rageblade on Wukong with his illusions. that would be a lot of damage. I think with that concept wukong would become a serious laner and jungler. \r\nTell me your thoughts in the comments guys and untill next time stay fresh and enjoy life, peace late.","replies":[]}
