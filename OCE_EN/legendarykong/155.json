And its so exciting to see, Wukong in a professional game so you can see how proplayer play him, like even the commentators are so excited about that pick. the last time Wukong got picked a professional level was last year at NA Challenger Series by the team GCU and before that he got picked 2015 at the EU LCS where Frederik picked Wukong in the Jungle vs Giants. Also Caps is one of the best players, so pretty exciting to see, how he plays the monkey.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellopolite","date":"2018-07-24T00:28:15.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"definitely a yasou counter pick once u get tiamat. his damage and manouverability outweighs his pd combos","replies":[]}]}
