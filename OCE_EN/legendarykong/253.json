Thats completely wrong!","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ENnGiF8p_c","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_ENnGiF8p_c/maxresdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can win every game. or if you dont tilt and tryhard to the max you can carry every game. or no single game is lost right away. you are the one who decideds wether you gonna win the game or not. it might be an expert who said that, or professional players or maybe big skilled youtubers. but the message is always the same, you can win, if you want to. But thats completely bullshit! Otherwise challenger players would have a 100 percent win ratio. but they dont! They dont! They have a lets say 55 percent win ratio might even be higher but never more than this. And the reason for that is very simple, you cant win every game. like even if you have a closer look on bronze five. you will see players over there that have like a 30 percent winratio. they completely dont know how to play the game but they still join the ranked queue, feeds the shit out of the game, but they still win it. Why? how can they win the game with like lets say 2kills 20 deaths. how? ama tell you how, cause this guy is lucky, he has someone who is carrying him. he is lucky. thats it, he is just lucky and you are unlucky, easy as that. And thats actually what tilts people, they really believe what other professionals say, that they can win every game. And if they not, they tilt so hard and flame other teammates.\r\n\r\nnow there might be some of you saying, but ey i know some people they have a 70 percent winratio or even higher. guys, im not talking about smurfers or boosters. OFC if you place a challenger into bronze, he will win every game and he will have a 100percent win ratio. im talking about people who play against people on the same skilllevel. But even boosters once the climb higher and higher, silver, gold, platinum their winratio will actually drop. Because you will always get teammates who feed the shit out of the game and even challenger player cant carry these guys on a specific skilllevel. So even boosters, once they reached a specific elo, their winratio will drop. And thats because league of legends is a coinflip game. yes, it is pretty much gambling. if the luck is on your side, you will win, if not you will lose. thats it! its just like poker. you guys all know poker right, ofc you need skill to win but there is still a specific winratio that tells if you can win the the round or not. and this is what people need to get in their head. once they got that, guess what, they wont tilt that easy. they understand that if i join the queue its by luck if i win or not. either i will get, bad players, feeders, disconnects autofilled people or the enemy will get them. And if your botlane goes like 2 15, there is nothing you can do about that. the luck wasnt on your side, try next time.\r\nnow ofc you can improve and get better and you can win more games on the long term. there might be things happening in the game where you can benefit from and win the game but this doesnt mean you gonna win the game because of pure skill. because on the other hand, you will have games where you can do whatever you want, but the games are out of your control. you can do shit. and you will lose it, because you are unlucky in this game. easy as that. you gotta know that you cant control every game and you gotta learn to deal with that. this is the only way how you can get tilt out of your head. how you can stop getting tilted because of league of legends. you gotta keep in mind that there is an rng factor in league of legends and because of that you cant control every game. this mindset is really important and you gotta get that.\r\n\r\ninstead you can try to minimize the rng factor by adapting to the current meta for example. dont pick champs where you need a faker skilllevel. try to pick roles that are not hard to play. i mean adc for example is really hard to play since you gotta pay attention to your positioning. picking a tank is much easier. i mean you can run into people and stay there for years, applying your cc and still outdamage full damage champs. riot logic right there xD. but yeah, this is how you keep the rng factor on a low level. i mean if you pick champs for the first time in ranked you need a lot of luck to win this game. but if you pick a champ that you played for like 1000 games, you dont need that much luck. even if you pick meta champ, the amount of luck, you need to win this game will decrease.\r\nNow lets give you guys few examples here and let me know in the comments if this happened to you. imagine you are playing on the midlane. your csing is faker like man, you are doing really well 100 cs at minute 10, you are warding both sides of the river, you even killed your enemy maybe once or twice. its basically the game of your life. but then the rng factor steps inside and gives you a 0 8 toplaner and a 2 14 botlane. and in the end you lose the game although you played a perfect game. this is when the rng factor hits you and %%%%ks ya right in ya asss guys. there is nothing you can do about that. another example, imagine you are playing a close, its minute fifty both teams are equal, a teamfight is about to happen. you, as the lcs super pro player ping your team to stick together and tell them in the chat to take care and to not get caught. suddenly your adc gets caught but he manges to get away, he runs towards the blast coan, but its not up and he dies there and a teamfight 4v5 is happening now that you lose and with that you lose the game. And you can do shit about that, because a dumb%%%%k out of your team got caught. and this is because league is teambased and you need your team to win the game. if the rng factor gives you shitty laners you will lose most likely. and this is when tilt happens. tilt always happens when luck is more important than skill. in poker they call it bad beat. or in league they call it unlucky game.\r\nyou know people are trying to fool you guys by saying that you can win every game if you put the effort in it, but they are just trying to sell you shitt to clickbait you with videos and make money out of you. but we are not doing that here guys. ama telling you the truth guys, and the truth is bitter and ugly, but league of legends is a coinflip game. period! accept that and you will live long while playing league.\r\ni will drop some more videos about that, to show you guys how to minimize the rng factor but the first step is, not to tilt by understanding that leauge is coinflip game and cant be always lucky. so if you dont wanna miss any video, hit the sub button, tell me about your opinion in the comment section and drop a like. as always guys, see you next video, peace late.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-08-18T04:43:54.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never used to dodge games, up until this season. It was based on a recommendation by Apdo: Check op.gg, if a bunch of your teammates are monkeys (e.g. less than 40% winrate) or autofilled, you dodge. That's what his advice was.\n\nHelps to eliminate some of the coinflip.","replies":[]}]}
