Whether this be by fixing the bug or promoting me straight to Challenger where I obviously belong... \r\n\r\nImage 1 (full) :\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Yc7ZsPM.jpg\r\n\r\nImage 2 (snapshot) :\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/IOfjJdo.jpg\r\n\r\nYours sincerely, Challenger wannabe {{item:3151}}","replies":[{"poster":"SoSaucy","date":"2016-11-17T10:08:04.191+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"you deserve it bud\nall that lp is yours fair n square","replies":[{"poster":"Cupboard","date":"2016-11-17T11:55:41.960+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"All those Ivern ADC games have finally payed off {{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-17T10:18:19.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's only a visual bug and you'll still earn LP as normal. Basically, it happens when the client tries to display negative LP values (i.e if you dodge or some such on 0LP), but instead of displaying 0 or even the negative value, it wraps back round to the highest value it can display. It's being worked on but it won't affect you in any way. Win a game and it'll go away on it's own.","replies":[{"poster":"Cupboard","date":"2016-11-17T11:54:13.919+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Boy you must be fun at parties.

You actually have -3 lp because you left or disconnected a champ select while at 0lp. what is more strange is that I would have expected this number to be 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 if league runs on a 64 bit integer but the 18,446,744,073,709,552,000 is clearly higher than the largest 64-bit integer so I have no idea where the number comes from.","replies":[]}]}
