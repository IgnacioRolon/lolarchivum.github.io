I play mages\nMy win rate on Lux (my main) is around 70%.  I have VERY good vision/ward game and have pretty good mechanics. I call out alot of team calls in chat for objectives/enemy missing locations.\n\nFor bottom I can also play Morgana (when she isn't banned all the freaking time), Brand (for armour shred), Zyra (when I lose lux/morg/brand).\nFor mid I play Syndra, Can play heimer and obviously Lux as well. Looking to pick up some more champs but only just picked up syndra 2 weeks ago and feel I can still improve my mechanics on her further as my win rate is pretty high (but can be better).\n\nI'd love to play with someone who is mechanically skilled, NOT suicidal in their plays, and thinks of the long term game wise.\nI'd especially love to find a good jungler who is good at both ganking, fighting for objectives and doesn't often fail on dives/mechanics.\n\nI've played with quite afew adc's and I synergise best with Jhin, Ezreal, Caitlyn, Jinx. \nHowever those that play a good Kai'sa and Xayah are always most welcome to have along.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT?\nI play around 5 games every day or so, I am a full time student who works alot but play often around 1pm or 6pm.\nIf we work well together i'll let you know (as i'm sure you will as well) if we don't then that's okay we can still try to improve our team work but if that still doesn't work then you will not become my main pick for playing in ranked games. I will also tell you honest opinions on areas in which I think you could improve if asked (only if asked) and would love feedback on my abilities as well. \n\nTo clarify feedback on missing 1 Q during a play isn't helpful. However feedback like ... time you q when they are slowed first or try not to panic on a dive or save your W for x moment would be positive feedback.\n\nAnyhow I look forward to talking to you in the near future. \n\nRegards,\n\nBlackestFury","replies":[{"poster":"Drose2046","date":"2019-11-07T23:09:47.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sent u a request.
