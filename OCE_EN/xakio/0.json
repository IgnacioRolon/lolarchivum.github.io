I really like the skin Blood Moon Akali as compared to the other skins, hers is less sinister and I feel like it has a different direction so I used it for this story. The word cap also didn&#039;t help as I had to cut down a lot of descriptions and I wanted to add a full description of the other Blood Moon skins towards the end but I was running out of words haha. Please enjoy my first story.\r\n\r\nThe night of the Blood Moon. A story of the long night through the perspective of one not so tainted by it compared to the others.\r\n\r\nThe sky was dark. Unusually dark for a night in the world of Runeterra. The moon that once illuminated the night now had an eerie presence to it. The white glow of its light had changed to something more sinister, one that people knew to avoid as the Moon emitted a sanguine light that bathed Runeterra in bloody glow. It was known as the Blood Moon which appeared at night for every so often. On par with the Black Mist, the New Moon signified the time for people to lock their doors and to pray that none of the horrors that befall the night do not come to fruition. During the night many demons and spirits that come out of their hidings to lay waste to the land. Ionia is known for being most affected place in which the inhabitants are succumbed to the many horrors of the Blood Moon due many people harnessing the power of the Blood Moon. Some joined the cult&rsquo;s to increase their power, some helped fight off demons and spirits with the power of the Blood Moon. While others, others sought to harness its power to kill. Whether it be revenge, a grudge or just for sport. None were safe from the horrors. Tonight was no different as the Blood Moon had risen. Akali could hear the sounds of battle from where she stood perched upon a mountain overlooking one of Ionia&rsquo;s small cities. It was her duty tonight to protect the village from demons and spirits as her two colleagues Shen and Kennen had different duties tonight. In order to keep balance they had also harnessed the Blood Moon to help protect Ionia&rsquo;s citizens from threats that would harm the people. Akali&rsquo;s gaze continued to stare at the city as it lay silent under the moon. A blood like mist had rolled over the city making it hard for Akali to spot out specific details. Akali felt a chill down her spine but reassured herself as she gripped her weapons firmly, she had already killed of most of the demons and spirits around the area as they were easy compared to the other things that roamed the night. The thing that made her the most anxious was the other people who had harnessed the power of the Blood Moon.  By taking in the power of the Blood Moon her clothes had become more traditional and had a spirit like theme to it. Her powers were also imbued with red aura allowing her abilities to take on a different form.  Akali suddenly heard a loud bang come from the city and streaks of red light coming from it followed by loud screams. In a blink of an eye Akali propelled herself of the mountain and quickly sped to the city. She was fast as she was a blur under the moonlight. As she entered deeper into the city Akali could feel the presence of many others who had harnessed the power of the Blood Moon. They were most likely alerted to the loud commotion as she was. Akali quickly stopped and scaled to the top of a building. She had a good view of the city from where she was. Her gaze fell upon a little courtyard with a fountain where she had seen the red light and she saw a lone figure. Akali held her breath as she began to make out what the person looked like. It was a lean man who had the same sort of traditional armour that Akali wore but more wicked and sinister as to imply that it had already begun sacrificing the souls of humans to the Blood Moon. The man wore a sinister mask and where the eye sockets lay was a red glow. She noticed the man was also humming a cheerful toon as he pulled out his weapon and begun to spin it around his fingers.He held a unique gun which Akali had seen somewhere before. Akali wondered if she should interfere but decided to wait it out. If the other presences she had been feeling were true, she wouldn&#039;t want to show herself so early in the game. As she watched the man she felt something drip onto her shoulder. It was cold and startled her as she jumped back in surprise to only find out it was raindrop. She looked up to the sky and saw that the clouds had gathered around the city and begun to shower it in a heavy downpour. Akali sighed as she turned her gaze back to the lone man only to be startled yet again. The man had cornered civilians. She watched him unmoving as he seemed to be talking to them. Akali wasn&rsquo;t sure if the man was going to help them or not so she decided to get closer to hear him. Silently but with speed and grace she leapt from the building and hid herself in a shroud to conceal herself as she landed on another building roof closer to the man. Akali could see that the man had cornered 3 unfortunate people, 2 males and 1 female. Akali was close enough to hear a woman speak out \r\n&ldquo;Please!, spare us! We were just passing thro&rdquo;\r\nShe was suddenly interrupted by the man who pointed his gun at her\r\n&ldquo;Wait for your Que, you&rsquo;re only here to herald my entrance.&rdquo;\r\nHis voice was calm but Akali could also make out a hint of bloodlust in his voice. The woman shivered and desperately asked \r\n&ldquo;B..b..bu...but what dou mea&rdquo;\r\nThere was a loud bang as the man raised his gun and shot one of the men. The woman screamed as the masked man manically laughed out\r\n&ldquo;1!&rdquo;\r\nHe pointed at the second man and shouted \r\n&ldquo;2&rdquo;\r\nas he shot him in the chest. Blood splattered across the masked man body but he continued to manically laugh. The woman began to run as the masked man turned to her. Akali began to move to save the lady but she was too late as the man shouted \r\n&ldquo;3!&rdquo;\r\n and a streaking red light shot out of his gun piercing the woman&rsquo;s heart. The woman collapsed on the ground as a pool of blood began to ooze from her body. Akali held her breath as she watched the masked man stare over the bodies. \r\n&ldquo;Places everyone, Places!&rdquo;\r\n The masked man was cackling with laughter as he stood over the bodies. A blood red like mist began to emit from the dead bodies and streamed straight into the masked man. He was harvesting their souls to increase his strength. The masked man stopped laughing and Akali heard him quietly say \r\n&ldquo;I swear each performance is the last, but I lie every time&rdquo;.\r\nHe stood there quietly after he said that and began to hum again. Akali was worried, she wasn&#039;t sure if she should stop the man or run. He looked like a strong opponent and she wasn&#039;t sure about the whereabouts of other presences she had felt before. She took a step back intending to retreat but she suddenly heard a loud crack. All of a sudden a red light had enveloped her and she looked down to see that she had stood on a trap. Her eyes widened as she tried to get away but the light suddenly exploded, forcefully knocking her forward into the courtyard. She was grazed but still conscious and managed to stand up before suddenly hearing \r\n&ldquo;4!&rdquo;\r\nand a streak of light coming straight at her. She rolled to the side as the bullet passed her hitting the fountain behind her and completely shattering it and continuing on to hit a house making it collapse as well. Akali looked up at the masked man to realise that she knew the man. Although his appearance at first was different due to harnessing the Blood Moon there was no doubt that the man&rsquo;s name was Jhin. He was a criminal of Ionia who called killing a &lsquo;performance&rsquo;. Akali saw that Jhin had begun to reload his gun while staring at her. As he finished reloading he looked at Akali and said very softly \r\n&ldquo;My dear countryman, you remind me of how little our culture has advanced.&rdquo;\r\nThey began to ready their weapons as Akali got ready for an all out fight. As they readied for battle the Blood Moon&rsquo;s light began to envelop the courtyard. And all of a sudden a number of figures had surrounded the rooftops of every building surrounding the courtyard. A red aura glowed from a rooftop as a man teleported onto it, A man covered in blades vaulted atop one of the buildings. Several other figures surrounded the area, each very unique and each with their own bloodlust towards each other. Akali knew that she was in for a fight&hellip;.","replies":[{"poster":"xAkio","date":"2017-03-11T12:43:46.667+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhhh when you see a spelling mistake but you already submitted it.

I also like how with the limited word count you have you still created a story that still interested the reader. The Jhin interaction was good as well but its a shame that the story that was posted shortly after is has the same theme and idea","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZVCKK","date":"2017-03-11T12:50:49.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"It was known as the Blood Moon which appeared at night for every so often.\"\nI don't have a solid suggestion for how this line _should_ be written, but I believe it could use editing of some kind.
