I play AI game and pick Annie. i joined the game then  found 3 scripts or third-party programs teammate, and they feed all the time. whatever, the last one guy is rookie he lag and dc when 25 min. well, i try to carry this game and i almost. why is almost.. coz my bot teammates surrender in 29 min.. god.  3/1 and i lose this game... {{summoner:3}} and this is the only lose game in my 380 AI game played.\r\nAfter we don&#039;t have level limited , more and more scripts player join the AI game.  And they Initiated the surrender after 20 min.\r\nI  am disappointed all my effort lost because the surrender system. \r\nNow. It&#039;s time to make some change. I suggest Riot can modify surrender system in AI GAME. why we need to surrender in a AI game? Plz delete it. or set to 5/0 pass surrender. ( i don&#039;t want someone lose the AI game like me, It&#039;s really bad )\r\n\r\nThere are two types bots now\r\nOne is jungle bot, they take {{summoner:7}} and{{summoner:11}} . they always pick {{champion:202}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:22}} \r\n they  stay in jungle all the game. they build {{item:3153}} \r\n\r\nanother one is feed bot. they always buy {{item:1001}} at start and make some terrible to real player. \r\n\r\nIf I cant end the game before 20 min, they will try to surrender. and it will pass because its 4/1\r\ni know is hard to ban all scripts and third-party programs player. But I don&#039;t think surrender still useful in AI game now and it help them end the game faster then join the other game. if we can&#039;t surrender , 5 bots team will spend a long time in game and lose, then easy to ban them all. \r\n\r\nPLEASE CHANGE IT. WE DONT WANT SURRENDER IN AI GAME ! ! and I don&#039;t want to lose because I got four bot teammate!","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-07T01:28:58.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lmao, interesting to know that the main update to the bots is the surrender feature, that's a feelsgoodman.","replies":[{"poster":"Dannii Darkness","date":"2017-12-09T11:14:18.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also the 'declare intent to .........' during the champion select is a new one to me.\n\nHad a bot declare they were going JG. I questioned the other 'player' that still had smite chosen if they were a bot. Turned out they both were.\n\nSurrender has been around for a little while with the bots. I had always thought Surrender required a unanimous vote result to be carried as I have seen 3v2 votes fail.\n\nI believe it these have become one of several variations designed to introduce doubt into whether or not they are bots into a potential reporting player's mind.","replies":[]}]}]}
