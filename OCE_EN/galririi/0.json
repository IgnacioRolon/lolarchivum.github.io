I understand that we can't gift skins because theres masterwork chests &amp; the possibility of obtaining skins that a friend may want which would ruin a major part of the purpose of buying RP, but when buying RP, with the limited options more often than not I purchase more than I actually needed &amp; I think there is no harm in allowing players to gift each other their own RP as we have already paid for the amount we received, especially if we're not going to be using it anymore. \n\nPlease feel free to comment your own thoughts on this, and discuss the reasons for or against this idea :)","replies":[{"poster":"ClickClack472","date":"2019-03-10T07:42:33.662+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot greed > community","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2019-03-09T07:44:41.985+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot would rather have more money but id like this to be added","replies":[{"poster":"galririi","date":"2019-03-15T13:48:56.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i mean it's not like they'd really lose sales, we're paying for the full amount we're receiving  &amp; lets keep in mind that its not like they need to spend anything out of their own pockets for sending the RP to the customer. \n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]}]}]}
