I understand that you&#039;ve probably had suggestions about this before and that it would be pretty difficult to do unless you made your workforce a lot larger in producing and managing such a large scale game without making a replica of skyrim or whatnot. and also another great idea i think like how you did the bilgewater event and &quot;killed&quot; gangplank with the help of the league community. There could be crossover events between the two games, lets say if Rek&#039;sai {{champion:421}}  was a boss of the shuriman deserts and was injured enough a certain amount of times she might unavailable to play in league of legends as she is tending to her wounds. (if you made it an MMORPG) But otherwise I think it would be an amazing game to play even if it doesn&#039;t come to life, though i really hope it does as i think it would make you a lot of money so you can expand your business and be a fun game to play\r\n\r\nSincerely, Reaper9959","replies":[{"poster":"Skyous","date":"2016-05-09T07:27:29.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The concept of having one game interact with another game is pretty good from a money making standpoint ( like how you play a game to unlock a certain skin or champ ) as people would want to unlock those types of things (completionist ya know), but I doubt Riot has any intention to do something like that, however would be a fun project for game designers as a hobby project! Nice Idea!!","replies":[]}]}
