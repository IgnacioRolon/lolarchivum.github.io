You then played 3 custom games where you were unaware you had LeaverBuster, but once you went to play bots you got a LeaverBuster low priority queue that was still there from the **Ryze** game. \n\n> Essentially, you thought you had received the LeaverBuster off the customs, when in fact it was still there from your recent normal game as **Ryze**.","replies":[{"poster":"Alenz da Destrya","date":"2016-09-16T07:11:41.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks mbro i think i know why i got it. thanks for finding info out on it now i know not to leave games","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-08-06T10:54:06.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lemme ask around for you :D \nIn the mean time there's no harm in asking [**Riot** support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) why this is happening.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
