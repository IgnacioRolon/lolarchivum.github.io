This is a loss of functionality that the previous client had.\r\n2) The Mastery/Rune Page Inteface - Previously you were easily able to access your rune pages and see how rune pages you had at a glance - Now having to click on the dropdown box to view this is extremely inconvenient and once again a loss of functionality.\r\n3) It requires a lot of knowledge about the icons. e.g. Chests/First Win of the Day/ARAM Rerolls etc. Of course it looks all pretty but for functionality - This was lost in the client update for a lot of the interfaces.\r\n\r\nWhoever was the solution architect for this client needs a new job.","replies":[{"poster":"Revenant13","date":"2016-11-11T10:00:01.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can hover over the icons and it tells you what they are, it keeps the visuals clean, makes sure there isn't too much on screen text, it looks more concise. I have my own gripes about the chat and friends list, I don't use chat that often but I dislike having a permanent friends list, I would much rather it was minimisable. I think that the mastery and rune pages are fantastic, it makes the client seem very tidy and minimal, how often do you actually need to check your rune pages (should know them tbh). I think the mastery pages in champ select could be improved by either making the icons take more of the space or decrease the size of the window.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MikuruKisune","date":"2016-11-11T09:35:15.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everything is shit about the New Interface.
