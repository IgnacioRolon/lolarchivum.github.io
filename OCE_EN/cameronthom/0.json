No matter how many people or accounts you punish or ban, there will *always* be someone that is either having a shitty day or is just fuckin pissed of at some stupid shit and maybe this is the game that they crack and start lashing out at people. in this case its not even that its just preemptive shit but still, you gotta be able to just brush this shit off and not take it to heart (by hardening up surprisingly). Im not saying you shouldnt report old mate for telling you to kill yourself, but you shouldnt let their words get to you.","replies":[{"poster":"Damocracy","date":"2016-08-26T08:38:59.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2016-08-26T09:18:17.133+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Damocracy,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=1qAvFAp1,comment-id=0003000000000000,timestamp=2016-08-26T08:38:59.701+0000)\n>\n> You missed the point.\n> This disagreement is over.\n\nwhatever mate continue to spam whine threads complaining about bullshit.\ncheers","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kenera","date":"2016-08-25T09:33:43.631+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thank goodness their are people like me who won't stand for direct violations of the summoners code.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} good on you!","replies":[]}]}
