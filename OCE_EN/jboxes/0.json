Use to be top 3 early damage adcs making her a lane bully which compensated her short range. (Draven, Graves, Quinn).\n\nNew Quinn- Less damage and only decent damage over time, No cc or any kind of utility, not a great duelist, no good wave clear, easily beat in lane, still low range, greater roaming potential.\n\nSo from my understanding they Nerfed a lot of her Kit so she can be fast which she already was before, just now it has low cool down. They try to advertise her as a good split pusher but she honestly is not. Sure she can get to lanes fast, but her wave clear sucks and she cant really one versus one anyone, since lack of damage and utility from blind. She cant really pick off anyone out of place, again because of lack of dueling potential. You can be 5/0 and still lose to a 1/3 graves. Her ult is now high mana cost, delay set up time, and canceled if hit by any champs, slowed by minions. Before her ult was instant cast, and a valuable ad steroid. It just seems like she really did not gain much. I honestly would rather the blind and less harrier strikes compared to now. Sure she has more harrier strikes but it sucks since her damage is mediocre. She is not a good split pusher, she is more of a let me recall right before a big team fight, buy a long sword and get back to the team because im fast. Seriously I know I sound like a dick, but really, I think we can all admit she sucks now. The only people who disagree are the people who did not actually play her before. She dint suck before, she was just unpopular. Her new ult is not really an ult, its more like a half assed transformation that you still have to wait to level 6 to get. Look at all the champs that have transformations, Gnar, Jayce, Nidalee, all get brand new cool downs and is actually effective when they transform instead of waiting 3 seconds and being able to move fast with no other skills. Even the old quinn did not get new cool downs when she transformed, so you had to be decisive about what skills you are going to use in what form, and how you are going to use your ult since it had a high cool down. The old ult does everything the new ult does better except for being able to get to more lanes faster. Old ult, better damage, better chance to pick someone off cause you can actually duel, better play making, better chance to actually make a viable decision, more attack speed, better in team fights, just better in general.\n\nI can rant all i want but riot already said her ult is staying the way it is. So my suggestion, is to give her Q some kind of actual utility, and make her W also offer some kind of actual utility. All she provides now is mediocre damage, with nothing else. If just baffles me how they can remove the offensive power from her ult and also take away damage from her regular form along with taking away utility. You have to let us have one or the other Riot. Fine leave the ult the way it is, but ether buff her damage or make her Q and W worth something in terms of utility. \n\nThey also change her because they want to give her a unique role. What about champs like Teemo? What role does a Teemo actually play in game except being a toxic champ overall, but they wont dare change Teemo, simply because too many people play him. Not many people plays Quinn so screw it, who is going to care that she is changed? Screw the players that do actually play her. \n\nSorry if this sound a bit of a rage post, but many of the things I said are true. I will admit the new Quinn is fun, but to accept her as a viable champion I would use in ranked, there are to be improvements to her current kit.
