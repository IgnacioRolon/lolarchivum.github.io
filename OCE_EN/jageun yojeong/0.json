Christmas Candy Kayne??","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since Kayne is a pretty popular Champion, why on earth does he only have ONE other skin since his release? \r\n\r\nMy friend and me are talking how when ever we say &ldquo;kayne&rdquo; we think of the candy cane we have on Christmast. So we thought, why not give Kayne a Christmast skin called candy Kayne?? Instead of his scythe, he can TOTALLYY hold a candy cane instead? And his raast form can be Santa cuz his red (holding a candy cane) and his Kayne form can be something like an elf or something? \r\n\r\nWe think this idea is PERFECT for Kayne since his name is literally &ldquo;cane&rdquo; and he should definitely deserve this skin!\r\n\r\nAM AYE RITEEEE???","replies":[{"poster":"Distortoise","date":"2018-08-06T06:55:57.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I recall Kayne doesn't exist in the game, Kayn however. {{champion:141}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-06-12T00:50:09.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't even play kayne and I want this.","replies":[{"poster":"Zandouraminu","date":"2018-06-15T13:59:42.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't agree with the forms,but we need this.Candy cane as a scythe.You see,I personnaly  think Krampus would be a better Rhaast.And then Kayn could be santa.I prefer this,but we need a candy cane skin for Kayn.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Nightjar,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=pmLWoUOU,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-06-12T00:50:09.940+0000)\n>\n> I don&#x27;t even play kayne and I want this.\n\nAgreed","replies":[]}]}]}
