The Dynamic picks is good but needs to be dynamic solo only mode to make ranked mean something. I may not even try in games where its a group of friends vs a smaller group of friends or just solos. riot says It is suppose to mirror the lobbies so that if there is a duo on one side, it should also be a duo on the other team, that is not the case for me.\r\n\r\nSo if the match making makes it unfair, I make its 4v5. I know I will receive verbal abuse and hate speech, but riot does not care so why should I.","replies":[]}
