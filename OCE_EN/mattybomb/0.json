I was hoping I could get in contact with somebody in which I could forward a CV and Resume. I study a Bachelor of Entertainment Industries at the Queensland University of Technology and being a long time player and fan of League of Legends I believe I could best attribute myself to an internship at Riot Game's OCE office.\r\n\r\nI couldn't find myself an email to contact directly so I am posting here for hopes of a response and potential internship.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your time,\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nMatthew Davis","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-10-17T02:36:40.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Google > Riot Games > Careers.
