As a result I began playing on my friend&#039;s smurf on Oceania.\r\nAt first, I was surprised at how much my ping would vary between games. Some games would have 130 ping while others would have 240. I knew this was not a connectivity problem as the friends I play with, who also live in Hong Kong, would have different pings when we play in the same game. \r\nThis was not an issue as 240 was still playable until I discovered that quitting the game after finishing loading and then re-joining would cause the ping to fall by 100! I have tried this in the past 5 games where I started with 250 in the loading screen, which I then re-joined only to have my ping drop to 130-150. \r\nSo my question is, what is it that allows disconnecting to reduce ping/lag????","replies":[{"poster":"MasterMirkinen","date":"2016-03-02T00:49:00.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I cannot think of anything that would make a reconnect  get you a better ping...","replies":[{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-03-02T18:07:29.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now i would love to ask why the servers can be so sketchy at times. \n\nMy ISP is fine and every other game and program runs smooth for me but this game will spike constantly from my 15 ping all the way up to 1000+ and below randomly with no warning.
