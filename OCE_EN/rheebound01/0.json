However I was constantly trying to aim for their backline in team fights and there wasn&#039;t much I could do against a Mundo. However, I poked him down and managed to harass a fair bit until mid/late game. It was at this point that Mundo was beating me. My friend before the match started complaining that I chose Rengar toplane and that I didn't know the meta. SO yes LeBlanc performed better than me, but the game being entirely my fault seems so stupid? I asked for ganks so often and only ever got 2 extremely early on when I didn&#039;t need them. So the poll I am starting is asking whether the whole game was really my fault and if I am the only reason our team lost the game. He now refuses to play with me and plays with my other friend (Who is 10x worse). What can I say to them/him to earn their friendship in LOL back?\n\n-Rheebound","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-09-30T07:44:13.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't like to nit pick other peoples performance... But by the looks of things your bot lane struggled, and your jg didn't score any objectives. Not a single lane took a tower, and Jinx fed off you all. Le Blanc was the team carry, but you failed as a team. It wasn't just one.\n\nAlso if he is being such a baby over losing a game, he is not your friend. Find someone less salty, and less serious to play with.\nOn that note, hit me up for some games if you want. I never flame and i'm always up for some non meta picks ;)","replies":[{"poster":"RheeBound01","date":"2016-09-30T12:30:41.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's my friend IRL :/\nI mean he's nice but when I fail a lane in top Im always flamed as playing bad and the only reason he plays with my other friend is because he tank Jg's which is so easy to play and busted. I play equally better as Rammus in the jg but he just prefers to play with him and doesn't play with me :///","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-09-30T05:59:22.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LeBlanc has such an annoying name. \n\nLeBlanc\nLeblanc\nLe\nBlanc","replies":[]},{"poster":"xDarkRavenx","date":"2016-09-29T10:34:48.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rengar top lol\n\nnever seen a Rengar top succeed.","replies":[]}]}
