You enter a game, get first blood and notices its a remake. Right now it is  unfair for people who won their lanes. From experience, it is definitely a waste of time.

Also how is that far for the team with the afk?","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2016-08-18T13:09:35.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's actually not unfair.

Now they waste 10+ minutes in queue, don't get to play, or get any LP. THAT is unfair.\n\nGive them 5 LP and send them on their way.\n\nIf a player is <5 LP off promos, however, put them on 100 LP but don't put them in promos but if they win that game they get a free win in promos.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Prince Smashy","date":"2016-08-14T23:09:19.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"doesn't matter if Caitlyn did snowball, she still would of won, because it's a 4v5","replies":[{"poster":"Hi Im Lotus","date":"2016-08-15T07:03:09.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah but then a remake happens.
