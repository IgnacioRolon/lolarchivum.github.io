I searched google and found out there was a transfer before, but it turns out it was already over.  I&#039;d like to bring my account with me since we&#039;re migrating to Australia next week. I have a lot of skins and other stuff in which I&#039;ve purchased using RP. It would be unfortunate if my account will be left behind. {{item:3070}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]}
