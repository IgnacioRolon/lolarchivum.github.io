While typically off-meta picks, that doesn't necessarily mean they're doing badly. I found the game in question and, honestly, looking at *all* the stats that are given, and considering those two were going with largely off-meta strategies, I'd say that they did about as well as OP did.

That is how you solo carry without relying on your team whilst somehow making all your other lanes win or not feed.\n\nEasy.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
