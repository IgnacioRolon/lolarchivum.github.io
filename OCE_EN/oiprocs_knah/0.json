Log in\n2. Find a game\n3. Champion select as normal\n4. As soon as the normal client is meant to close and reopen the 'loading screen' client nothing happens\n\nThe weird thing is the lobby client closes as normal however does not open the ingame client?\nAn even weirder occurrence is that clicking the menu next to time (where you can safely remove USB etc) there is a little riot logo. Upon clicking this logo it opens up the client again displaying the \"RECONNECT\" button.\nWhen I click this reconnect button it closes the client as normal however does not open the 'loading screen' client? But in the USB remove tab thing next to the clock I can find the little riot logo again and clicking it opens the reconnect screen as so on.\n\nIf anyone has any idea on how to fix this please assist me, I am currently getting leave buster warnings constantly as I cannot join games randomly (this started occurring in the 3rd match of the day (3 normal matches, next match this occured, no breaks). I know this problem is blanketed by riot as one big firewall problem so I am aware that my support ticket will fall upon deaf ears\n\nThings I have tried:\n1. Repairing the client [x]\n2. Retrying in a new game [x]\n3. Reinstalling client [ ] (very time consuming)\n4. Sending support ticket [x]\n\nTLDL; if you are reading this I'm afraid you are no help ;p\n\nKind regards, Lasoo","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2014-12-08T03:28:56.814+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assuming your AV is completely up to date, is anyone still having this issue?
