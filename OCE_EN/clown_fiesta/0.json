I'll paste what I just found on the IINET website:\n> \n> \"Service External Connectivity Type Fault (Serious) Started 5 hours ago\n> Event ID 4565295 Status Happening now Ending in 10 hours\n> Affected Service(s)\n> \n> External Connectivity\n> \n> Some Broadband customers in Western Australia & South Australia may experience higher than usual latency & packet loss. This may cause slower than usual browsing speeds. \n> \n> Technical Summary\n> \n> Loss of traffic across our network partner's domestic transit links has been observed.\n> Resolution\n> \n> Our network partner has advised that the origin of the issue has been isolated to a remote SA area and have dispatched field technicians to the site. \n> Due to the remote location, it will take some time for technicians to arrive.\"\n\nSo basically some node / station in remote SA is screwing up and either flooding the network with garbage, or causing collisions. I assume.","replies":[{"poster":"Clown Fiesta","date":"2016-01-31T11:47:28.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SA","replies":[]}]}]}
