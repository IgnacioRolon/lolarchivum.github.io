I never get bugsplats or otherwise, but I have experienced the infamous \"forever load screen\", where there's no way to tell if it's just a reall long load due to someone having a toaster or if the client has lost connectivity, as you're just on the load screen forever.\nI've joined a number of games 10 minutes in, without there being any way of me knowing that the game had already been underway unless I had force closed the client and relogged.\nI think punishment for \"never joining the game\" as opposed to \"afking later in the game\" should be far less.\n\nThough it's happened far less on OCE than on NA, for me, it still happens.\n\nI also think it should be made viable from someone afking/quitting the game for over 10 minutes, with full penalty to the leaver in that situation, obviously.\n\nI think what gets overlooked in many of these features is that somehow the question \"how will this effect an honest player?\" is overlooked in favour of \"how could this be exploited by a dishonest player? no matter how small of an exploit\", which I find disheartening.","replies":[{"poster":"Tempered in Salt","date":"2016-07-31T11:23:19.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not quite sure about the /remake however for your problems of a forever load screen I think i have a way to solve them.\n\nOk since internet connection isn't stable your ping should constantly increase and decrease. So if you notice that your ping hasn't moved for a while try switching windows and switching back. If it still hasn't moved you might have a forever loading screen (I used this technique during the days i had a really crappy laptop to play league).","replies":[{"poster":"Gloric","date":"2016-07-31T11:34:14.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a very stable connection (as far as anything else is concerned) and a incredibly up-to-date PC. My ping never really fluctuates outside of when the load screen initially pops up, usually starts off about 50-60ms then a few seconds it stays at 30ms until the game loads in. I usually judge by other people's load %, if they stop moving at 80 or 90%, it means something went wrong, and I relog. \nHowever sometimes it has happened when everyone was at 100%. I also don't sit there looking at the load screen every time, I often alt tab until the game loads in, chatting or otherwise\n\nI will say it's only happened maybe once or twice in the past few months, but before then it would happen a lot more.\n\nNot saying there isn't a way to fix it, just saying it's something that does happen to people and them (or as mentioned, an honest player) getting punished for a flaw in the client is a bit of a punch in the face.\n\nI've not been hit by any leaver buster, ever, as far as I know (as i've never left a game or failed to load in eventually), however I would like to keep my perfect record =P","replies":[{"poster":"Tempered in Salt","date":"2016-07-31T12:07:01.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah to those of us with crappy pc's or are the victims of it just randomly happening it is a bit flawed and back in those days i really wished there was a way for the league client had a way of knowing if you had issues getting into game and let you off. But then again you take into account the people those have to deal with an afk and they can't go uncompensated and so now and so now we have this problem on our hands where you can't be blamed but the people in game who can't go un-compensated which is what the /remake command tries to solve so i would suggest Riot edit it so it let's off those who don't get into game and punishes those who get into game but AFK on purpose (for reasons other than ping).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-07-31T10:39:08.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Justice ;^)","replies":[]}]}
