So I logged in today and went through a League update and then once I logged in all of my Champions and Skins were gone. Re-patched the client to be safe but no change there, launched a practice game but can&#039;t select anything at Champion Select as I have nothing unlocked apparently. Also account level is 31, not only that but there are no free champions available to choose either. This just a me thing or are there others having fun with this too?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nCaptainCon","replies":[{"poster":"AP Trist","date":"2018-10-10T03:07:30.631+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"have the same issues too, all my champions and skins have been wiped.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainCon321","date":"2018-10-10T05:11:50.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So it is more than a single user, meaning it's probably going to be multiple more so hopefully Riot jumps on it fast.","replies":[]}]}]}
