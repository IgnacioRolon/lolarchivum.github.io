I have also been kicked out of champion select with an &quot;Unknown Error&quot; and then unable to log back into League of Legends for 20+ minutes afterwards. All this time, I am getting &quot;punished&quot; for &quot;abandoning a game&quot; that I never actually got to play in because **_the game_** kicked me out.\r\n\r\nI have: \r\n- reinstalled League of Legends\r\n- disabled all firewalls and anti-virus software while running LoL.\r\n- restarted my computer and router several times over the course of playing.\r\n- tried connecting with a VPN.\r\n\r\nnone of the following have prevented this &quot;Unknown Error&quot; from kicking me out of the game. And I mean, I would really love to tell you more so I could fix it... but how am I supposed to know what&#039;s going on when the game itself calls it an &quot;Unknown Error&quot;?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-26T06:23:20.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Servers are currently throwing up their insides.
