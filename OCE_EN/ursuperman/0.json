From what I understand is that Riot refuse to ban anyone on OCE server because of small population of player base, but this is taking it too far. \r\n\r\nLet me start with the auto fill system.. why?  because from my past few game most of the toxic kid I met are all support who ask for another lane and when they do not get what they want they goes bot and stay under bot tower afk typing insult to me or other teammate for the rest of the game and calling teammate feeder amd that the teamshould have given them the role they want.. like really? Wrost part the report does nothing from what I can tell since I get match up with these douch a few days later.\r\n\r\nI do not care if you do bad because you have a bad day but blaming team and being toxic and calling them loser plus wishing theirs family cancer is just not right in so many way.  I do not know if 60% of lol player base have got mental issue or something, but Riot REALLY need to do something about these player and I know that Riot wont be doing anything becuase they would lost  80% of their income and thats why I decide to quit lol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRANT OVER SORRY FOR BAD ENGLISH","replies":[{"poster":"xReverie","date":"2017-08-03T02:08:57.243+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"New honour system is a step forward.

It NEVER happens and if it does it's so rare that it makes reporting essentially a waste of time.\n\nOver the years I've reported intent feeders who blatantly run it down mid lane, purchase 5 mobo boots etc etc and not one has ever been banned ever! The ones I report are still playing to this day and from their game history haven't changed.\n\nRiot simply want to gag players and stop them from lashing out at the real people who ruin this game. They simply don't care that 1 person can ruin a game for 4 others as long as you refrain from abusing them. I mean if they really banned people intent feeding and griefing the player base on the OCE server would be pathetically low and in return so would skin sales etc.\n\nLess people playing the game means less sales. And for a ftp game EVERYTHING is based on micro transactions.\n\nPersonally based off my own games I think there is little or nothing they can do about the OCE server without seriously culling the player base. Majority of games are I play these days are filled with toxic, intent feeding and griefing players. People cottoned on that there is no tribunal and little chance of actually getting punished (unless you verbally abuse someone) and now pretty much do as they please. We've all had games where someone gets salty and sits in the jungle the entire game whilst you lose your nexus. Or the guy who gets annoyed when he gets outplayed and then constantly tries to 1v5 knowing damn well he's not going to survive. It's people like this who understand the system and it's lack of ability to pickup on their actions so they abuse it to their advantage.","replies":[{"poster":"xReverie","date":"2017-08-03T03:55:05.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had notifications of players being banned in the client, in which I've contributed reports to. The notifications are random due to privacy concerns.\n\nThere may not be immediate results from reporting, but it does contribute and help - even if it doesn't there's an opportunity for the report to help.\n\nRiot incentives around money, sales, and lack of bans etc are speculations from incomplete data. I'd give the benefit of the doubt to say they don't want toxic players in the game as it drives people away, and they're investing in the honour system.\n\nPerhaps some more constructive feedback to Riot will help, rather than assumptions, accusations and venting.","replies":[]}]}]}
