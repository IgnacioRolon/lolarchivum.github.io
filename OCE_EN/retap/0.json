Cant tell what was rushed first.\n\nRUNES:\nGates: I have an issue with the CDR runes, either decrees to 5% or go too 10%\nMost recommend going 10% as all items now go 10% CDR and dont have 5% anymore.\nreason, you are potentially wasted almost all of your CDR runes if they stay like that, even if you decrees you will either have 35% or 45% which you cant\nas 40% is the limit.\nBut if you go 10% then you only need 2-3 items to reach 40%.\n\nAlso scaling HP I dont think is good at all.\nreplace with armor, even if its scaling armor.\n\nYAS/ADC:\nonly issues are with HP at lvl 18 and crit dmg.\nas Yasuo sure its easy to get 100% crit chance, and crit dmg slightly helps with your 5% decrees in dmg.\nBut in the end pure dmg ends up being way better countering the 5% nerf.\nHP at lvl 18 is redundant with armor / armor per lvl.\n\nMASTERIES.\n\"Press w to cry\"\nIm assuming this is for xin jungle, then why didnt you get jungle masteries?\nYou've gone STR of the aegis, but then gotten AP masteries in offensive?\n\n\"Lee sin you filthy fk\"\nIm also assuming again that this is leesin jungle. Then why have bond of stone?\nand no jungle masteries.\n\nHere is a link to some of the runes I've used and why I've used them.\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/fGgHBJAu-runes-and-masteries-discussing-what-i-use-and-what-to-know-what-everyone-else-uses\n\nFor more info on the volunteer program.\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/Abb3ru0g-boards-moderation-revamp-visible-moderation-now-live\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nAlso check this out.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XPrqvD8Lfo&list=PLyCEt27AsZuvNu0RQiCwgV2j3tR4foqvI\n\nThere have been many more people like you asking for help.\nI do stuff (When I have the time, I'm slow, I like to sleep a lot) and help bronze summoners like yourself.\nThe first three games the one that has morgana and the next two after that, that guy has now reached silver 4.\nBoy was I proud, most of it will be hard work.\n\nBut if that guy can go from Bronze 4 to Silver 4 by himself with just a little bit of help then you should be able too as well.\n\nNow, you've taken the first step and admitted you need help.\nBut its gonna be hard, its not gonna happen over a week or a few days.\nThat guy has kept at it from (When ever that vid was released) to now.\n\nBe willing to accept your mistakes, work on them and improve upon yourself.\n\nHopefully this has helped.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-06-18T15:14:20.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyo!
