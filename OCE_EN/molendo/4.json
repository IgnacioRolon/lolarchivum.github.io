Its ruining the 3 other ppls promos/ game as well on my team. What am i talking about? The certain people you get in promos.\n\n\nONLY in promos do u get top ashes, mid ad sonas, and people who threaten to afk if they get stuck with supp, saying they suck at supp but theyre gold 3. Sigh. .Now, i dont mind these picks as long as they can play them, but no these ones couldnt. Both of them fed in each game.  I swear when its not promos i get good cooperative teams. Why is this?   does rito purposely match u with retards in promos and cooperatuive people in non promos?\n\nEdit - Now in game we got another troll running into turrets cause got ks'ed. Once again, rarely happens in non promo games.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-02T03:44:02.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure if this is bait but if it is, I'll bite. It's because people know when you're in your promos thanks to websites such as lolnexus and then intentionally try to ruin the game for you (called gatekeeping if I'm not mistaken). Personally I think Riot should remove the ability for players to see when others are in their promos.","replies":[{"poster":"Molendo","date":"2014-12-02T03:47:56.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no but its literally nearly every promos.

The fact is, you don't belong in gold, that's why you can't get it.
