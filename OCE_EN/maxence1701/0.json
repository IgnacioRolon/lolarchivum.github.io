Just for a game or Ezreal it was just spam ping me, he insulted me &quot;son of a bitch,&quot; and it was to die repeatedly. I think its really unfair because I said &quot;Wow That Xin&quot; Because He 3v1, but after a while I could not go this Ezreal that caused spam ping me. I&#039;ve mute after. And just because I answered 2 times to the insults I def ban? Wow Spend $ 305 get for perma ban, thanks you riot. You&#039;ll probably see some thing because I enormously calm lately. I answered this Ezreal because it is horrible to insult my mother for a video game. Finally, I think you will do nothing for me and probably you will reply that I did not answer but good case. This is to achieve the damage as I guess it Ezreal will be no suspension.
