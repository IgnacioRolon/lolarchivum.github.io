I&#039;ve been fairly consistently earning 10-14 and losing 17-24 with no idea why.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-29T08:26:53.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, what you are expected to know as a basis is that you **gain points for winning** and **lose points for losing**. This sounds super obvious but you have to keep it in mind to understand the rest of it.\n\nThere's a hidden value in League of Legends called Match-making rating (MMR for short) which is a rough approximation of your skill level as measured on a numerical scale. This is calculated from the results of your matches, and of the players you are matched against.\n\nFor instance, if you were to go into a 1v1 match against a person with 700 MMR in a match-made mode, and win, you would gain MMR if you won the match and had lower MMR, and lose MMR if you lost the match and had higher MMR. If you had higher MMR and won anyway, you wouldn't gain anything, and the same if you had lower MMR and lost. This might be an exaggeration of what actually happens but hopefully you're understanding it so far.\n\nWhen you enter a match-made queue, you are matched with nine other players (depending on the game mode, of course) with similar MMR values. Then you are split into teams to have roughly the same total MMR. The game treats whether you gain MMR or lose it for each team as a whole.\n\nNow, where LP comes into play, in normal divisions (ie. bronze to plat) you will always gain LP when winning and lose LP when losing. The amount which you get/lose is dependent on the MMR difference of the teams. This is respectful to winning and losing.\n\ntl dr; if you were expected to win, you get less LP for winning, and vice-versa.\n\nHope that huge wall of text clears it up for you.","replies":[]}]}
