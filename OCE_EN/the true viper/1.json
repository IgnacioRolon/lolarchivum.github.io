I doesn't seem fair. it's part of the 120 ap set and is perfect for a Mage. Since mages have no hp unless you happen to be {{champion:8}}. High damage low hp that's the trade off. {{item:3128}} gives the ap and cool down. I wish they would take into account all forums and stop shooting players in the foot. If they want to curb the mages stop lowering magic resistance.  If you like this item please let riot know as i have.","replies":[{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-01-19T13:56:40.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":";) it's because there is no counter to getting bursted down {{item:3102}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3102}}","replies":[{"poster":"the true Viper","date":"2015-01-19T16:28:36.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"it's just the noobs crying that the {{champion:105}}  one hit them. Well if they didn't gank him and keep suppressed it's their own fault. A ton of champs are going down the toilet when this comes in and riot wonders why they are losing ppl to warfame and other online games. I thought with the last patch riot had come to their senses. didn't agree with some things but that's a given.

It's quite strong. I've been running around dropping tanks from 3.5K HP to zero on Le'blanc the last few days and that's not quite fair for the enemy team. \"Oh you have a tanky, pce homie g\" Now their back line has to deal with your front and back line. (Well, your adc while you wait for cool downs.)\n\nBesides Le'blanc it also gives you the 15% MAX Hp damage on anyone, if you're playing another burst mid laner enjoy that +20% to all your damage.  (Lux, Ezreal, Zilean, Annie, Fizz, Galio, Heimerdinger, Katarina. Just to name a few.) Arguement Buff MR!: Forces everyone to go magic pen items. Which then still leave that poor ADC with the lack or MR to be even more of a target. Making it so you can hurt the tank makes it so you don't always have to only go for the ADC, the tanks can be killed! (I would say support but MR is everyone on supports.)\n\ntl;dr: DFG = 5th Ability w/ dumb burst potential.","replies":[]}]}
