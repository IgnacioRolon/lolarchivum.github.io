I think I was suspended because I was telling the Twitch on my team to kill himself. I did not mean this, the Twitch is friends with my sister who was the Rek&#039;Sai on my team. I was just telling him to kill himself because, you know, banter. It may not look like this was the case through just the text alone but I didn&#039;t I hurt his feelings or verbally abused him on purpose. If you have suspended me for other reasons, such as because I swore in the chat, I believe this is totally unfair because you have the option to turn the chat filter on for swear-words and if anyone was unsatisfied with my language that does exist.\r\n\r\nI think the purpose of a ban is to let the person receiving the ban know that they have done something wrong, and give them time to reflect on it. I have reflected as you can see from these paragraphs and I know that I did something wrong.\r\n\r\nI didn&#039;t mean anything I said. I will never say bad words ever again. Thank you for helping me become a better person. I promise and I understand that if I continue to say these hurtful words I could possibly be permanently banned. I have spent 200$ on this account and would not like that money to go to waste.\r\n\r\nI have spent the last 3 days reflecting on my suspension and how I could get unbanned because I am truly sorry. I have formed some arguments as to why I think I deserve to be unbanned and I would appreciate it if you would read them.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I understand that I was in the wrong and I should have never been using this type of hurtful language because even though I didn&#039;t mean it, it still affected others in a negative way. If in future I wish to participate in banter I should make sure I am clear that I am not directly intending to hurt anyone&#039;s feelings and it is just the competitive nature of the game (which I enjoy), or perhaps not participate in banter at all. I promise to stop all swear words and other words that can be hurtful and extremely rude to others such as kys. I have also formulated a list of things that I should do in the future to avoid the temptation of responding with hurtful words.\r\n\r\nI should instantly mute anyone who is being toxic and report them after the game. People need to learn that this type of language affects others and sometimes the only way to help them do that is to issue a punishment (as you did in my case). This will discourage me to retaliate with other hurtful words which would make me as bad as the person who started being toxic first.\r\n\r\nUnfriending and blocking anyone who had a negative influence on me in terms of tilt and a negative attitude would also, in my opinion, be a step in the right direction. Taking a deep breathe every 5 minutes of the gameplay also might help me become un-tiltable.\r\n\r\nI also should only use pings to communicate with my team unless absolutely necessary, such as if I need to tell my team to group near baron while I split push at bottom lane. This will let me focus more about how we will win the game with strategical pings and therefore not look at the chat so much.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to my last point which is to reduce the size of the chat so I don&#039;t look at it as often. This is a good idea to stop me from really saying anything at all in chat which means that if I am not saying much in chat I will not be toxic at all.\r\n\r\nI have understood that it is not right to say any more negative things in the chat and have made points that can help me do that. I think you can clearly see that I have reflected on my behaviour and it is unnecessary to have me wait out the punishment. I&#039;m still going to be unbanned eventually and I kindly ask for you to lift my ban earlier because I have fully reflected on my mistakes (I&#039;m a fast learner).\r\n\r\nI have read the summoner&#039;s code and promised to abide by it, and I also have changed my password to something about not being toxic so when I log in to my account I will be reminded to have a positive attitude.\r\n\r\nHere is the chat log:\r\n\r\nGame 1 \r\noFuzzeh: sure \r\noFuzzeh: of course \r\noFuzzeh: how much \r\noFuzzeh: what skin \r\noFuzzeh: kk \r\noFuzzeh: aight \r\noFuzzeh: xdDdD \r\noFuzzeh: kench carry u \r\noFuzzeh: lol \r\noFuzzeh: lol \r\noFuzzeh: kys twitch \r\noFuzzeh: wow \r\noFuzzeh: oi \r\noFuzzeh: lol \r\noFuzzeh: wow twitch \r\noFuzzeh: kys \r\noFuzzeh: u stole my triple now \r\noFuzzeh: fuq u \r\noFuzzeh: hmmph \r\noFuzzeh: zed 1v1 \r\noFuzzeh: if i win i get the account for free \r\noFuzzeh: XD \r\noFuzzeh: kk \r\noFuzzeh: fine \r\noFuzzeh: i dot=nt have ignite \r\noFuzzeh: :/ \r\noFuzzeh: yeah because tahm isnt tank enough \r\noFuzzeh: she* \r\noFuzzeh: ez \r\noFuzzeh: wanna 1v1 yt \r\noFuzzeh: yet \r\noFuzzeh: zed \r\noFuzzeh: !v1 \r\noFuzzeh: baron \r\noFuzzeh: 1v1 \r\noFuzzeh: wait i will tp in \r\noFuzzeh: at top \r\noFuzzeh: dont kill \r\noFuzzeh: mid \r\noFuzzeh: come \r\noFuzzeh: mid \r\noFuzzeh: this way \r\noFuzzeh: can i kill teem \r\noFuzzeh: wow \r\noFuzzeh: lol \r\noFuzzeh: everyone came \r\noFuzzeh: xdd \r\noFuzzeh: go to baron at 45 min \r\noFuzzeh: i will go there \r\noFuzzeh: fuck they ending \r\noFuzzeh: woow \r\noFuzzeh: gg\r\n\r\nI regret what I said in-game, please forgive me.

Everyone has a right to appeal their case although Riot don't usually reverse their punishments unless they were made in error (which this wasn't). \n\nWe can't help you further on the boards and since you have already tried the official process, the only thing you can do now is wait out the next 14 days and hopefully not ever repeat this kind of behavior (because then its a perma).","replies":[{"poster":"oFuzzeh","date":"2017-09-26T00:56:52.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why do I deserve to have to wait 11 more days to be unbanned?

The punishments that are used (not just by Riot, and not just in online communities) are there to encourage individuals to reflect on their behaviour, understand why that behaviour was wrong, and accept the consequences of their actions.\n\nIf you are unable to accept the consequences, I find it hard to believe that you have truly reflected on your behaviour.\n\nIt's not as if you have *nothing* else to do during that time. League isn't the only game available to you (and I'd argue it certainly  isn't the best). You could go outside for a change, do something to better yourself and/or your community. You could do some chores around the house, surprise the people you live with (if anyone). Take the time to appreciate life while you're unable to play LoL, and you might just find out something about yourself along the way.\n\nLeague is not your life, nor should it be. Accept that your actions got you here and find something productive to do with your time.","replies":[{"poster":"oFuzzeh","date":"2017-09-26T03:24:50.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also why would I do chores...

I don't really enjoy any other games, league is the best one by far. I've gone outside but it's a bit boring by myself with my parents/siblings always out shopping and doing other things because they have it scheduled (for example hockey matches).
