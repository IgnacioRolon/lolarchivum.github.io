I believe I did not do anything wrong and I ask you to reconsider your opinion on my suspension or maybe reduce the amount of time it will take for me to be unbanned.\r\n\r\nI think I was suspended because I was telling the Twitch on my team to kill himself. I did not mean this, the Twitch is friends with my sister who was the Rek&#039;Sai on my team. I was just telling him to kill himself because, you know, banter. It may not look like this was the case through just the text alone but I didn&#039;t I hurt his feelings or verbally abused him on purpose. If you have suspended me for other reasons, such as because I swore in the chat, I believe this is totally unfair because you have the option to turn the chat filter on for swear-words and if anyone was unsatisfied with my language that does exist. I am sorry for what I did in this game, please for give me. Thank you for reading my explanation as to why I think my consequences for my behaviour was incorrect.\r\n\r\nP.S. If it helps for you to know my mental health is already bad feeling depressed every day this has made me feel very sad and worried about the type of person I am growing up to be because I am just 13 years of age I am already taking pills just please please please lift the ban I am so sorry I&#039;ve been lying on the trampoline reflecting on my behaviour about how it is so wrong and I should never swear or be rude to people again and I will be a very nice individual from now on and always be kind and helping towards others. I believe I am reformed and ready to become a better person. No this is not a joke I am being very mature.\r\n\r\nHere is the chat log:\r\n\r\nGame 1 \r\noFuzzeh: sure \r\noFuzzeh: of course \r\noFuzzeh: how much \r\noFuzzeh: what skin \r\noFuzzeh: kk \r\noFuzzeh: aight \r\noFuzzeh: xdDdD \r\noFuzzeh: kench carry u \r\noFuzzeh: lol \r\noFuzzeh: lol \r\noFuzzeh: kys twitch \r\noFuzzeh: wow \r\noFuzzeh: oi \r\noFuzzeh: lol \r\noFuzzeh: wow twitch \r\noFuzzeh: kys \r\noFuzzeh: u stole my triple now \r\noFuzzeh: fuq u \r\noFuzzeh: hmmph \r\noFuzzeh: zed 1v1 \r\noFuzzeh: if i win i get the account for free \r\noFuzzeh: XD \r\noFuzzeh: kk \r\noFuzzeh: fine \r\noFuzzeh: i dot=nt have ignite \r\noFuzzeh: :/ \r\noFuzzeh: yeah because tahm isnt tank enough \r\noFuzzeh: she* \r\noFuzzeh: ez \r\noFuzzeh: wanna 1v1 yt \r\noFuzzeh: yet \r\noFuzzeh: zed \r\noFuzzeh: !v1 \r\noFuzzeh: baron \r\noFuzzeh: 1v1 \r\noFuzzeh: wait i will tp in \r\noFuzzeh: at top \r\noFuzzeh: dont kill \r\noFuzzeh: mid \r\noFuzzeh: come \r\noFuzzeh: mid \r\noFuzzeh: this way \r\noFuzzeh: can i kill teem \r\noFuzzeh: wow \r\noFuzzeh: lol \r\noFuzzeh: everyone came \r\noFuzzeh: xdd \r\noFuzzeh: go to baron at 45 min \r\noFuzzeh: i will go there \r\noFuzzeh: fuck they ending \r\noFuzzeh: woow \r\noFuzzeh: gg","replies":[{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2017-09-22T08:36:13.073+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey oFuzzeh,\n\nLooking at your chat log provided it is immediately apparent that you got punished for telling the twitch to kill himself. \nI'm not sure if this is your first ever punishment through the IFS, but it usually goes through stages:\n\n> First offense: 10 game chat restriction\n> Second offense: 25 game chat restriction\n> Third offense: 2 week ban\n> Fourth offense: Permanent ban\n\nSometimes behavior that is deemed \"incredibly toxic\" by the community is punished more severely and often skips straight to the ban stage. This type of behavior includes racism, homophobia, **encouraging suicide/self harm**, and death threats. \n\nWhile this may have been \"banter\" within your premade, obviously someone in the game that was exposed to this \"banter\" did not appreciate it, and for good reason. Encouraging suicide is a sore point for a lot of players, making them likely to report it even when it is said jokingly. If you wish to engage in such \"banter\" with your premade, I suggest you do what the majority of other players do and get into a voice chat. That way other players don't have to get dragged into it. \n\nIf you wish to appeal your case/believe it was in error you may do so by submitting a[ support ticket to Riot\n](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and a dedicated support agent will be able to assist you. \nIn saying this, imo it's a pretty clear cut for behaviour Riot doesn't want in their community and I highly doubt your punishment will be overturned. Best use this as a learning experience and move on once your temp ban is over.","replies":[{"poster":"HolyAnuss","date":"2017-09-22T10:54:12.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"how could you ban someone on an assumption kys means kill your self. i know this guy has admitted it in this post but what about others? it could mean kiss your self? random thought there","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-09-22T12:08:28.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When it comes to the term \"kys\" there is a common connotation that it means \"kill yourself\" (and a similar thing can be said about many other terms/acronyms). While there may be (in very rare instances) players who use it as something else, the bottom line is that it is, in no minor part, seen as \"suicide encouragement\" by the majority of the community (arguably even the vast majority). I've seen a few instances of players trying to explain away their use of negative terms (including some instances regarding \"kys\") by claiming they mean something different, however none of those situations has been resolved without treating the terms as using their common connotation (and one of those instances involved a language where \"kys\" seems to be a legitimate word, in essence meaning \"kiss\").\n\nThe fact of the matter is that Riot takes a very serious position in regards to things like suicide encouragement, so naturally terms such as \"kys\" are taken very seriously (especially when used consistently).","replies":[{"poster":"HolyAnuss","date":"2017-09-22T13:17:40.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"meh just downer people assuming the worst imo thats toxic thinking so him saying it is reinforcing a thought already seeded in that persons mind. i dont really see much darkness unless i read between the lines to find it. maybe these people ought to stop listening to death metal and stop cutting themselves","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-09-22T17:10:22.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps the reason that most people assume the worst about these kinds of terms is because, most of the time (if not pretty much all the time), they're used in the \"worst way\". If it weren't such a common occurrence for \"kys\" being used as a way to say \"kill yourself\", perhaps the stigma surrounding the term wouldn't be so strong and it wouldn't be that common for people to assume that's how it's being used.\n\nIf someone really wants to say something other than \"kill yourself\", then they shouldn't be \"messing around\" with acronyms, particularly acronyms with negative connotations to them. If someone wants to say \"kiss yourself\" (as per your example) or \"keep yourself safe\" (an actual example of an excuse someone used), then they should just say that, rather than risking it being misinterpreted.","replies":[{"poster":"HolyAnuss","date":"2017-09-23T01:54:11.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"meh just rubbish really, in all his chat log wasnt the least bit toxic. we could go round in circles for years but i dont mind if wrong or right. im not banned and thats all that matters to me better not {{champion:222}} it tho","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2017-09-22T13:23:12.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is in human nature to assume.
