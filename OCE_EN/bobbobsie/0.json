They're powerlevellers selling the accounts and this is a tried and true method of getting accounts up without really ever getting caught.\n\nThe worst thing is that people don't believe me when I tell them they're bots. No matter what I say, what I do, or try to show them (the constant kamikaze, absolutely never B'ing under any cirucmstances, and never responding EVER when I ask them to say something,, and the general mechanistic nature of how they play) they still don't believe me.\n\nSome of the bots are sophisticated too, so it can be difficult to tell if they're a bot or bad, but watch the patterns and eventually you can tell if it's just a bad player.\n\nEven worse than that, nobody then reports them because they don't believeand then just dismisses me as being \"A scrub who can't carry his team\".\n\nIt's actually insane.{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"ciaô","date":"2015-11-21T07:55:17.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there are bots in aram? o.O","replies":[{"poster":"rooksta","date":"2015-11-21T09:32:26.897+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not like the A.I. bots in practice mode.","replies":[{"poster":"ciaô","date":"2015-11-21T12:35:55.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh ahaa","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Huckabees","date":"2015-11-22T14:47:04.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe it's Mark Cuban","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-11-22T00:58:03.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Report them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BobBobsie","date":"2015-11-21T07:38:28.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://s28.postimg.org/6ux5zitkt/aram_bots_op.jpg\nwhen 8/10 players are bots. fun game riot","replies":[{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-11-21T08:01:57.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BobBobsie,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=hIiess25,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-11-21T07:38:28.280+0000)\n>\n> http://s28.postimg.org/6ux5zitkt/aram_bots_op.jpg\n> when 8/10 players are bots. fun game riot\n\nIs that sona really a bot ?
