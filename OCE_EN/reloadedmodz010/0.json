This allows for Riot to be able to scale their resources efficiently to test changes that are being considered for live. There isn't really a reason to establish multiple PBE servers, as it would increase the amount of resources to test features for the same outcome. Sorry about that. \n\n> The PBE servers are hosted in Los Angeles, California, and are smaller-capacity than our live environments. This makes it much easier for us to update the PBE with new content every day. If you don't normally play on NA, you will likely experience higher-than-normal ping.","replies":[]}]}
