As such, I'd like to direct you to the [**Report A Bug**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report) sub-boards for posting your bug reports. The Riot staff looking for bug reports frequent those sub-boards more than they frequent the Help & Support sub-boards, so you'll have a higher chance of having the issue addressed if you post there. \n\nCheers!","replies":[{"poster":"Tsukuyomi noKami","date":"2016-08-15T10:49:41.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I couldn't find it when i looked the first time, jeez im blind lol. thanks for the reply.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-08-15T21:35:22.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tsukuyomi noKami,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=AUeBPd4a,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-08-15T10:49:41.985+0000)\n>\n> I couldn&#x27;t find it when i looked the first time, jeez im blind lol. thanks for the reply.\n\nAhah, no worries! :D","replies":[]}]}]}]}
