Banners were spread across every wall, featuring one of three faces of the legendary Demacian leaders. Festive lights were strung from one end of the city to the other, and the full moon shined brightly above, illuminating the faces of Prince Jarvan, Garen and Xin Zhao. The three sat together  at a round, wooden table in the back of Blackwater Pub, which was credited with the most delicious mead in all of Runeterra. \r\n   &quot;You know boys,&quot; Jarvan began, garnering his trusted friends&#039; attentions, &quot;I really hate seeing you act so poised and formal. Loosen up a bit. Tonight I am your friend from the womb, not your prince.&quot; Jarvan addressed the elephant in the room, referring to the way the two generals sat with straight backs, stiff shoulders and chins held high. The two men shared a look, then turned back to the prince, who had one eyebrow raised in their direction. In unison they slumped into their chairs and laughed.\r\n   &quot;You should have seen the look on your face!&quot; Garen exclaimed, in between fits of hysterical laughter and pounding his fist on the table.\r\n   &quot;You&#039;ve been so uncomfortable for the past ten minutes, we thought your face would burn redder than a tomato.&quot; Xin commented, wiping tears from his eyes. He and Garen continued to burst in random laughter as they shared looks, proud of the trick they had pulled on their prince and captain.\r\n   &quot;I&#039;ll have you hanged!&quot; Jarvan squeaked, prompting further laughter from his men. He really thought they were being as formal as possible in the presence of his royalty. He mentally kicked himself for falling for such a trick. As if Garen and Xin Zhao, the most famous drinkers in Demacia, would sit there and watch their drinks sit on the table due to their friend being a prince. He would get them back soon, he thought to himself. Jarvan was always a bit envious of the bond that the other two shared, as they were on a more equal status and were able to spend more time together than he ever was. But he knew they were by his side no matter what, and that was all he needed.\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n   A bit further outside the city, a fleet of ships bearing the mark of Ionia sails into the Demacian port. As the ships move closer to dock, heroic figures could be seen on deck. Irelia stood tall, her blades floating above her head, arms around the shoulders of her brother, Zelos. They waved to the crowd amassing at the dock, grins plastered across their faces. Master Yi stood behind them, as graceful as he ever would be, emanating peace. In complete contrast, next to Yi was Wukong, performing tricks and receiving chants and praise from the crowd, even bidding a small smile from his mentor. The ships slowed to a halt, and an eager Lux rushed to the edge of the boardwalk, having foregone her brother&#039;s invitation to instead meet with Ezreal, who had jumped at the opportunity of travelling to Demacia. \r\n   &quot;Brave Ionians!&quot; Zelos shouted, addressing the people of his homeland. &quot;The days of Runeterra have returned to the way they were ten years ago! The tyranny of Noxus has been driven back to its origin!&quot; His words were drowned by the roar of the crowd that had been on the fleet. He smiled at his beloved sister as he waited for the crowd to settle down. &quot;Go out and enjoy yourselves! You have earned it!&quot; He cheered, and the people of Ionia rushed up the path towards the city, enjoying themselves on this momentous occasion.\r\n   Only the few most respected and famous warriors had remained on the ship, waiting for the crowd to leave. They sat at a table as they waited for a few more minutes. Ezreal grabbed the deck of cards that was on the table, and began to put on a wonderful act of the renowned Twisted Fate, much to the amusement of the Ionians, and his dearest Lux. Irelia smiled and pushed her chair back, and walked towards the edge of the ship. She looked out into the ocean, studying the horizon carefully. She felt a hand on her shoulder, and turned to see her brother looking intently into her eyes.\r\n   &quot;What bothers you, sister?&quot; Zelos asked. He knew something was not right.\r\n   &quot;Zelos,&quot; Irelia sighed, a heavy weight in her voice, &quot;Do you remember Yasuo?&quot; Her brother nodded. &quot;He was exiled from Ionia on the implication that he had murdered an elder of his school. When people are exiled, they soon start to hate their country and old society, yet for the past eight years, Yasuo has not. In fact, he uses his mastery of the wind to warn me in times of danger. I can feel Yasuo&#039;s wind now, of all times, after the end of a decade long war.&quot; She explained. Zelos looked at her for a few seconds, then laughed.\r\n   &quot;Irelia, I&#039;m sure you&#039;re imagining things. Do you really think that fool would do such things? I think your mind has misled you this whole time. And if it was true, this is a time of rejoice, not impending danger. Do not fret, Irelia.&quot; He smiled, reassuring his sister.\r\n   &quot;I do hope you&#039;re right Zelos.&quot; She mused, embracing her brother to search for comfort. \r\n   &quot;Alright everyone, we should go.&quot; Ezreal announced, and led the group to Blackwater Pub.\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n   &quot;Guess who&#039;s here!&quot; Poppy shouted as she swung open the door to let in the travelers. The three generals stood up to greet their guests, as well as Vayne, Shyvanna and Quinn, who had recently joined the trio. \r\n   &quot;I&#039;m glad you&#039;ve arrived safely! It wouldn&#039;t be a true celebration without our allies.&quot; Jarvan greeted the group. &quot;But where is Lee Sin? I would have loved for him to be here!&quot; He chuckled, questioning the absence of such an inspirational figure. However at the mention of his name, Irelia and Zelos lowered their gaze, and even Wukong stopped his ever playful manner in respect and sadness. \r\n   &quot;Lee Sin was murdered by someone from the village that was destroyed on that dreadful day. Soon afterwards he committed suicide, maybe to avoid being jailed, or perhaps due to the regret in killing such a powerful figure.&quot; Karma sorrowfully whispered. The place was quiet, with Sona having stopped playing her hymns, and the small group silent. The only thing they could hear was the liveliness of the main city in the distance.\r\n   &quot;We&#039;ll remember his contribution. A round of drinks for his bravery.&quot; Garen proposed, receiving profound agreement from the group. \r\n\r\n   Everyone was seated again as the atmosphere began to pick up, the second round of drinks on its way. Even though they rarely fought together, they all had a mutual feeling of compatriotism, and it was as if they had been soldiers in arms forever. They shared stories of the war and some of the most astonishing things they had seen during their travels. As the second round of drinks arrived, they all listened to Garen, who would always lead toasts.\r\n   &quot;We have all fought a hard war. Today, we celebrate the end of what was a difficult time for Demacia and Ionia. Two nations have come together in times of need. Our normal lives will soon return, and the most eventful thing that will happen to us all year will be the addition of a family member, the joining of two families, or our buddy here Xin Zhao getting a girl. To a new era of peace!&quot;\r\n   &quot;To a new era of peace!&quot; The group resounded, but before the first person&#039;s lips touched the rim of a mug, Valor swooped in through the open window. \r\n   &quot;Valor! What is it?&quot; Quinn asked as Valor fretted on her arm. The door slammed open to reveal Fiora, panting heavily. \r\n   &quot;There&#039;s an unknown ship approaching the harbor. We don&#039;t have any clue to who it is, and we decided it would be best to-&quot; \r\nBOOM!\r\nThe mugs of mead spilt over the shaking table, the impact of a cannonball felt nearby. Irelia sighed, and locked eyes with her brother, almost scolding him for being so ignorant. \r\n   &quot;Hey on the plus side, we aren&#039;t too drunk to fight yet.&quot; Wukong chimed, attempting to lighten the mood. The group shared looks, acknowledging the trust they had in each other. They collected their weapons and armor from the front of the pub, and walked outside to observe the happenings.\r\nBOOM! \r\nAnother cannonball hit the city. The lone ship was soon followed by a small fleet. Gangplank could be seen laughing as he ordered the cannons to continue fire.\r\n&quot;Will we ever have a normal day on this damn continent?&quot; Master Yi asked, shaking his head.\r\n&quot;This is a normal day!&quot; Garen replied, following his prince into battle.","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T11:57:23.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha I love the humour you put into the story.
