Maybe even a Champion suggestion I can farm pretty well for the newbie leauge I&#039;m in so is there anyone you guys would suggest learning that would help me along in the quest for high elo when I get to 30 for ranked.\r\n\r\nMy build currently with Nasus I have been following the LoLKing guide.\r\nLink: http://www.lolking.net/guides/156983\r\nEven though it is old it still has some good information about him.\r\n\r\nThanks again guys, any help is appreciated.\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[{"poster":"Suki no Sukiru","date":"2015-11-17T08:21:47.461+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well... That guides right, except i suggest summoner spell be TP and Exhaust instead of ghost. Exhaust slows down enemies as well as making them deal less damage to you. As for the runes, they are not very good. I suggest runes that scale with level. \nHere are my nasus Runes. The Page is called Tank AD\n9x Greater Mark of Scaling attack damage.\n9x Greater Seal of Scaling Armor\n9x Greater Glyph of Scaling Magic Resist\n3x Greater Quintessence of Scaling Attack Damage.\nTotal stats will be +27 Armor and Magic resist at level 18 and 35 AD at level 18.\nYou might not want this if you want to be strong early game.... But with this you overscale most players in late game.\nAnd Items well, they are alright....ish\nStarting item should be Cloth armor or Null Magic Mantle for AD or AP opponents. \nNow for starters, your boot depends on the damage type your opponent is. {{item:3111}}  for AP top laner and{{item:3047}}  for AD top laners. However, if the enemy team has another fed AD or AP, change boot to counter the fed enemy attack type. You want to win the game, not just the lane.\nCorrect with AD or AP top get Frozen Heart or Spirit visage from your guide, that is right. As well as Triforce is a must.\nYour item build order should be (F for Frozen heart and S for spirit Visage) F or S first depending on the enemy top laner. Followed by a boot. Then the other item (If you got F get S, If you got S get F). After this work on a Trinity Force. With these 4 items done, the rest you can have work offensively or defensively or Hybrid. But i usually get {{item:3156}} along with {{item:3143}} . For Bonus HP, AD, Armor, Magic resist as well as an active slow and passive Magic Shield. But this is not recommended if the enemy have no Mages or only 1 mage. ( But if they are fed then this is good) The other build is {{item:3068}} {{item:3143}} . If you want to go more AD, get these{{item:3156}} {{item:3139}} . Hope this Helps :) \nO and easy top laners are {{champion:86}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:58}} \nOnce you get better, there are some harder top laners but are very strong if played well.{{champion:107}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:92}} ","replies":[]}]}
