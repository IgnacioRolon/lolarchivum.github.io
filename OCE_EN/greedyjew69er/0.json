I think Riot should lower this or at least have a sale on it, i can&#039;t play games on this account because of the name and fear of it getting banned, i&#039;ve wished to change it for so long but it&#039;s not worth spending that much IP or RP","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-05-10T00:07:25.002+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi summoner, \n\nOn occasion there are RP sales of name changes but usually they're at the beginning of season. The ip price is more of an IP sink for those who have everything else left to buy.\n\nIf someone reports you in game as having an offensive name (your name is pretty anti-semitic), you will basically be forced to change your name. Unless you are a repeat offender, a ban is unlikely to be issued based on name alone. \n\n**My suggestion would be to submit a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us), explaining the situation as well as why your name is problematic and they may be able to force a name change from that**. Please keep in mind that player support is busy and it may take a lil while for them to get back to you (almost always reply within a week). During this time do not lodge multiple tickets or continue adding information to your existing ticket, as it may send your enquiry to the back of the queue. \n\nChoose something more appropriate next time ♥","replies":[{"poster":"GreedyJew69er","date":"2016-05-14T09:34:40.161+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thank you for that, i'll try submit a support ticket now <3  can't wait for my {{champion:63}} new name {{item:3151}}","replies":[{"poster":"colossalJinx","date":"2017-11-06T02:37:31.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it doesn't look like you ever got your name changed :s","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-05-14T10:36:29.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it goes on sale ever christmas/newyear so players can \"Start fresh\"","replies":[]}]}
