Boots. Just... boots. I&#039;ve noticed the bots buy boots as their first item. And thats about it :P.\r\n\r\nNow onto the question. Are bots allowed? Can people use bots to play, I don&#039;t believe so as it can create an unfair advantage for either team depending if the bot is smart or not :D. If not is there a way of reporting bots as I don&#039;t remember seeing it as a reportable offence when reporting a player.","replies":[{"poster":"CryoxCandy","date":"2017-10-07T05:29:12.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The bot did end up doing better than the ADC X3.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2017-09-12T09:50:53.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey summoner, \n\nBotting is 100% not allowed in games, and should be reported so the accounts scripts like this can get weeded out faster. When reporting players for this particular offense, you can report them under the \"3rd party software\" category as well as the \"griefing\" one since the bots do tend to feed.","replies":[]}]}
