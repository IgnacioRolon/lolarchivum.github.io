In the new season though,  the level cap has been raised so would that result in players above level 30 being  matched or would simply find players is a certain range, level 0-10 11-20 21-30 31-40 and so on. How exactly does the matchmaking system work? Is it simply level or through our league ranks as well?\r\n\r\nNote: This is not on ranked matchmaking but norms","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-11-07T08:56:45.452+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Levels don't matter all that much. Just as visible rank (gold, silver etc) is only a vague indication of skill that doesn't account for all the factors, the same goes for level. In fact level accounts for even less really. All level really shows is how many games you've played since this preseason started, which really doesn't mean much at all.\n\nNormals have a hidden MMR (matchmaking rating/rank) just as ranked does (they have separate MMR) that determines who you will be matched again. A level 45 can be of equal skill to a level 65, so they aren't going to limit matchmaking by levels.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-07T08:55:59.485+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's based on your Hidden MMR, that is calculated from your winning and losing of games in normal games (specifically, normal only takes normals into account.)","replies":[]}]}
