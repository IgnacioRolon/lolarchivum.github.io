Whenever I try to open with the .exe, using admin as well, it loads the initial logo with tthe bar beneath, instantly closes and then nothing appears afterwards. No process in task manager. I have tried re-installing, completely, several times, as well as into a different directory. I have allowed LoL through my anti-virus, tried the fix that involves deleting specific files, re-starting my computer after each new install and attempt and I have a stable internet connection the entire time. Nothing has worked. Please help. Computer runs on windows 7 by the way.

The way I assume createProcess logging works is that the process is created with createWinProc() and then using a Win32API call checking whether the process is active. This means that something is terminating the process after its first cycle.\n\nYou have two options:\n1) Although absolutly a last resort, reinstall windows from scratch (Complete Format)\n2) Attach a process watcher to the process by PID and check its interactions within the Windows Messaging pipeline. Try and freeze the process on creation and capture its state.\n\ntl;dr My inclinations are its not league of legends at all, Its something on your system terminating that process.\n\nDo you have  Razer Synapt installed by any chance?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-21T07:11:19.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">reinstall windows\n\nYou must be joking. This is an issue with the way the program is written, not because someone has changed the settings from non-default. And the way Microsofts wants you to install Windows, you just should not do it. It formats your hard-drive, making you partition the drive or buy an expensive extrenal backup to keep your data (not to mention, you may not know what you need to keep, like config files).\n\nThis issue has happened to many people, and Riot needs to see to this. They didn't thoroughly test the new patcher, and that is their fault.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gophernuts","date":"2015-01-21T04:00:23.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds complicated.
