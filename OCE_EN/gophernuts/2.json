I've tried re-installing completely, deleting files specified in old threads and re-opening, re-starting my computer, it has been allowed through my anti-virus, i have a stable internet connection. Help please\nUpdate: I now think it's a problem with the patcher itself, or maybe something is still blocking it's connection to the internet somehow. I tried reinstalling to a different directory, however once it got to the logo with the progress bar beneath, it loaded until about 1/3 of the way and crashed. Now it's back to the original problem.

You aren't getting the \"Could not connect to internet, check your firewall\" error message. It seems like something more preliminary, that's preventing the process from opening at all.\n\nOpen up your Task Manager. Describe the events that happen when you attempt to open League, noting things like how many seconds it takes to crash/how long it is to when it disappears from screen and when the process actually ends.\n\nThen, try it again using compatibility mode (try compatibility for Windows XP with SP).","replies":[{"poster":"Gophernuts","date":"2015-01-20T10:03:38.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First attempt, both LoLPatcher and LoLLauncher processes open for 3 seconds.

I have absolutely no clue why though. As soon as i deleted both of those it started working again. I Guess that's what i get for illegally downloading these things right?

I kinda forgot that, with all this anti-virus I have now.\n\nEh.\n\nIt may not have actually been those softwares that stopped League from working, but something which was packaged with those softwares. Best way to avoid that is to just acquire them legally; that way even if the program causes League to stop working, you can bring it up with their support.\n\nGlad to have helped!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
