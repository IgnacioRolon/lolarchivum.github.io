Preseason is to practice the new meta and prepare yourself for the season. You will normally get placed at least 5 divisions below your MMR (Not a fact just the way it seems) This means that even though you are in bronze 4 you are meant to be in Bronze 1/Silver 5, and as such wins will count for 30 or more lp and loses will count for 10 or less so you can climb hard and easily. Another aspect of this is that getting promoted has quite a high chance of bouncing you 2 tiers (IE Bronze 4 to Bronze 2). My friend was Gold 5 at the end of the season he did his quals and went 4 wins and 6 loses and got placed in bronze 1. He got promoted after 6 games and got put into silver 3, it really is super easy to climb at this time in the season.","replies":[{"poster":"TwoUnique","date":"2015-01-23T00:54:45.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HoofBoy,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Qu4jth0U,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-01-22T12:58:58.854+0000)\n>\n> Preseason isnt there for you to climb...thats what the season is for.

Preseason games don't change your MMR significantly like normal season ranked games. Before seeding your MMR was soft reset, Meaning it would be 1-2 divisions lower than where you ended up at the end of season 4, only slightly changed by preseason MMR. \nIf you are truly deserving of silver you will climb quickly.","replies":[{"poster":"headshotjosh","date":"2015-01-22T00:43:50.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"before presaeons  was silver 4 as u see in the lolking link at the lolking score graph it just plummited","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2015-01-22T01:13:14.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"generally means that through preseason you got good and are able to carry yourself back to your last rank after being dropped lower.\nAlso, it looks like before preseason you were actually middle bronze which would explain the low placement. Despite reaching silver 4 in preseason, you MMR would be nearer to Bronze 1/Silver 5 and get reset to Bronze 2/3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"headshotjosh","date":"2015-01-22T00:47:31.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also what was the point of reseason if u wana get urself ready for the season and then all ur hard work lost","replies":[]}]}]}
