Riot please","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"I have been watching pro games like in LCK, LPL, LCS etc and saw a Zoe instantly poping an enemy from a long distance every two games. This is disgusting to watch and seriously hurting game play experience. Riot claimed that s6 Leblanc&#039;s skill set is unfair for the opposition because it leaves you no time to respond and the burst damage is too high. Now let&#039;s do some simple comparisons between the two:\r\n\r\nS6 Leblanc&#039;s disadvantage:\r\n- High difficulty to pull off the combo\r\n- Skill shot is harder to hit considering the size, range and travel speed of projectiles (ethereal chain vs sleepy trouble bubble)  \r\n- Can be cc&#039;d to stop her from returning to her original position (higher risk)\r\n- Need to get closer to the target comparing with the range of sleepy trouble bubble (higher risk)\r\n- cc is a root effect instead of a sleep effect, which is basically a stun before waking up\r\n- longer cd on combo (considering the skill with the longest cd, Lb&#039;s ult vs bubble)\r\n\r\nS6 Leblanc&#039;s advantage:\r\n- More slippery (passive and can choose to escape with w)\r\n- A bit more damage considering all skills landed\r\n- Could deal more aoe damage depending on the combo, which also means higher versatality\r\n\r\nConclusion: From the standpoint of the opponent of these two champs, Zoe is clearly harder to play against defensively but easier to kill compared to S6 Leblanc. If S6 Leblanc was too strong that a rework was needed, then Zoe only deserves a nerf even more. S6 Leblanc was also more fun because you get to use different combos depending on the situation whereas Zoe is just one trick sleep-and-pop-you.","replies":[{"poster":"catch this work","date":"2018-02-13T12:19:03.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except Leblanc actually took a brain to play, Zoe is more about whether or not your opponent is unlucky enough to not notice your E.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-02-01T13:41:29.759+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Zoe's stuff can be blocked by literally everything, is incredibly easy to predict, and has a long travel/arm time.\n\nOld Leblanc's damage _(remember they are mostly referring to her ability to Q/W instantly for half your HP)_, is targetable and AoE, instant, and at no risk to herself.\n\nZoe like Aurelion Sol is a good example of a champion with extreme strengths and extreme weaknesses.\nZoe is squishy and immobile, she gets 1 chance, for that 1 chance she has to predict, position and aim 3 seperate spells _(4 if you count the first cast on her Q)_. If she fucks any of it up, she dies in under a second. Thats pretty much exactly the definition of counterplay.\n\nGoing near your minions, being hit with a targetable orb then immediately jumped on, just to wait 5 seconds to have it happen again. Is not counterplay.\n\nMaybe becasue its a mid laner and im used to aiming and predicting skill shots, but I have no problems at all sign Zoe.\nAll you have to do is think _\"If I was Zoe, how/where would I shoot my bubble?\"_ and then just not do that.\n\nWhat do you mean Zoe is harder to play against defensively? \nAs long as there is at least 1 minion near you, you're safe, just keep it between you and her, and if she fires her Q to the side, put the minion between you and it. \n\n\n_________\n\nIm not saying Zoe is weak, or doesn't need a nerf. There are several things she doesn't need. Like the reset on her E for example.\nBut she still has wayyyy more counterplay than old LB's 'harass'.","replies":[{"poster":"00 Setsuna","date":"2018-02-03T11:52:23.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's say we agree Zoe's combo is not easy, she does not get punished if she fucked it up. She can remain in the back line and w8 for the next cd. Yes she is immobile, but unless you come from behind you have no hope of catching onto her without getting hit by e. If Zoe got caught in the open, it is obviously a positioning error...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RealDsy","date":"2018-02-02T00:22:44.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why do you compare to old stuffs? Its simply op.\n\nBiggest problem is her E. Its skillshoot yes but very easy to land very fast and also can shoot miles away. Put you sleep to 2 sec and if it does you are dead. Its kinda like an ashe ulti. But she can also follow up... lool\n\nNone cares laning face you can hide behind minions since lategame in teamfights she lands her E very easy. And that point you or your mate is dead.\nIn teamfight you never can catch her since she jump always with R. So stun chapions cant do anything unless they coming from behind.\n\nSo its totally safe to play deals ton of damage from behind with jumps. And also has kinda the best cc in the game with almost range of ashe ult. It can be used also for zoning.\n\nI tried btw lategame buy cc removel item. With annie was the plan if i got hit by her e just remove effect and kill her. But its not possible since she always jump on you with her R. So once you remove cc she is out of your screen.(cant even flash stun her) You can only doge her follow up q. Which is nice since you dont get one shotted but you cant even damage her as a punishment of missing her q.\n\nANd if we talk about lb i played with the old one a lot. The new is bad even for a joke. You are burst with delayed burst who two shotted by adcs. Since you cant tell enemy adc \"please wait 2 sec until my damage proc with my passive\" Unfortunately rito didnt think about this...","replies":[{"poster":"00 Setsuna","date":"2018-02-03T11:49:09.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am comparing Zoe to old Lb because old Lb got axed but Zoe has not (yet).\nAnd I agree new Lb is just a complete joke right now.","replies":[]}]}]}
