For example, a team consisting of {{champion:432}} , {{champion:23}} , {{champion:157}}  , {{champion:421}}  , {{champion:58}}  would get absolutely smashed by a team of mages/supports/adcs like {{champion:99}} , {{champion:43}}, {{champion:81}} , {{champion:126}} , {{champion:76}} except for cases of extreme skill disparity and MAYBE an afk. I think a way of making ARAM &#039;balanced&#039; while still maintaining the allure of playing a random champ is this:\r\n\r\n- For a certain period of time track the win loss rates of champions on ARAM, or KDA, maybe a player survey to ascertain which champions are perhaps a little op.\r\n\r\n- Give each champion a numerical value depending on how op they are (higher for champs with higher win rates and kdas and vice versa).\r\n\r\n- Add an equation or WHATEVER to the random champion selection process, that ensures that teams have relatively equal &#039;score&#039; with a certain degree of discrepancy.\r\n\r\nWhile the re-addition of {{summoner:31}} brings many champs such as melee assassins and initiator tanks further up the list, I think something like this would really help reduce hilariously frustrating and disheartening games that result in nothing but broken dreams and &#039;omfg bgnwp teammates suck cant dodge skillshots&#039;","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-30T14:26:26.078+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":">Random\n\n>Balance\n\nThese two words don't work together.\n\nIt's either ARAM and not balanced, or AKRAM and balanced (All kinda Random All Mid)\n\nARAM is fine as it is, and honestly, each team can win because each side has power spikes at certain periods over the other team.\n\nNot to mention, you used a example of these 2 teams\n\n{{champion:432}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:58}} \n\nV\n\n{{champion:99}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:76}} \n\nThe scarier team is actually the tanky engage comp over the poke comp, they just have to play it right (don't take much poke, engage heavily any time you can)\n\nWhile the poke comp is the easier one, Against a combo like Rek/Yas your looking at being punished hard for being out of place (or just flash/tunneled on), and the first team only gets punished for being poked (which is something they stop by dodging)","replies":[{"poster":"Markus7575","date":"2015-04-30T22:15:17.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In a fair open fight initiated by the melee team, they would win (at level 6 though) but the thing about ARAM is not taking too much poke is MUCH easier said than done, MUCH MUCH easier. given the nature of the poking team, the poke is so frequent and punishing that seemingly the only option would be to stay out of exp range, which MAKES engaging heavily much harder (although this has been somewhat mitigated by the Mark spell). Another thing is that in my experience the initial bush skirmish which inevitably results in decided the winner of the laning stage is almost ALWAYS won by teams like the poke comp which has both single target AND AOE damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-04-30T17:23:50.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The strategy you suppose relies immensely on on the poke team making some sort of positional mistake which applies to any match composition.\n\nTheir positional mistake can easily be rectified by their heavy CC or their Utility/Movement boosts.\nLux is the only real punishable champion out of the 5 (but still not by far) because she has heavy CC, albeit no movement speed steroids or dash/blinks. She can use her Slow to deny area.\nJayce can knock back anyone that tries to engage on them. Use gate to help disengage back under tower and transform for added movement speed bonus. Not to mention his poke.\nNidalee will stay the farthest back, occasionally healing others because she shouldn't be in any real threat at all. \nKarma is a mix of Nidalee's movement speed and Lux's heavy CC. She can deny area for a smaller period of time than Lux. She has a movement speed boost and adds a strong AP scaling shield.\nA competent Ezreal knows he has to save Arcane Shift in early to mid game. Iceborn Gauntlet effectively allows him some small strength in area denial. \n\nRek'sai really can't engage on them. The amount of Snares that can disrupt her tunnel/dash negates that. At the best of times she could only ult under tower tunnels or straight in front of their team not the preferable back.\nYasuo's strategy to E through minions is hampered by the nature of the game mode. His team composition only has one source of knockup, if Rek'Sai fails or dies, He would need to rely on himself. His whirwind can easily be dodged by most except Lux.\n\nTryndamere relies on AA as a source of damage, which is hampered by the nature of ARAM. Although unkillable for a short amount of time, He can still be snared to death. His Slow is pretty effective but kinda gets countered by Jayce's gate.\n\nBard would be useful with his Stuns. Ezreal and Nidalee, the two best source of damage would be very difficult to catch with their dashes/blinks. His E usefulness is severely hampered because of the lack of terrain. Ultimate would theoretically win them teamfights, but Bard has a weak source of damage whereas all of their enemy team deals damage.\n\nRenekton would really be shield, his Slice Range limits his mobility. Vulnerable to snares, of which Karma covers and subsequently Lux covers. His ultimate helps for being meatshield, his damage would probably be hampered in that he'd need to build more tanky items to survive lane. Q is effective only when he initiates successfully with E. W would be a nice follow up to the other's ultimates though.\n\nOverall, the poke team offers a wider variety sources of damage than the melee team because the melee team is all physical damage not counting Bard's negligible magic damage. \nThere is a chance that Melee team will win, but more often than not; highly likely they won't.\n\nConsidering Everyone in ARAM takes flash, I see the Melee team's window of engages as extremely uncommon and small.","replies":[{"poster":"Markus7575","date":"2015-04-30T22:10:41.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for phrasing this better than I could, one of the reasons I chose Bard specifically on the losing team is because, as it currently stands, on ARAM he is awful, his heal is negligible, his e is useless, and since so few people MAIN Bard and can play him well if someone gets him and doesn't reroll most of the time they just troll/feed because they don't want to bother trying to learn him, and I don't think I've ever seen his ultimate used effectively on ARAM, I'm sure it COULD, but I just haven't. Also another point about karma is that in my experience her poke is SEVERELY underestimated, if you build her AP her short cooldowns and heavy mobility ensure lots of damage, especially at long range given the nature of her ulti.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-04-30T17:35:38.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's also a few mechanical faults like:\nEzreal's blink, Nidalee's Dash and Jayce's knockback can still be casted even though Renekton had/is stunning them.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-30T18:28:56.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes because being knocked up by Rek and then ult'd by yas means you can react.","replies":[{"poster":"Markus7575","date":"2015-04-30T22:05:28.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can though, she's not invisible and the myriad of heals and shields buffer quite a bit of yasuo's damage. I mean I probably used a bad example of champions but I was trying to make a point. There's also an argument to be made about the nature of healing supports and how hilarious they make the game, in my experience supports like {{champion:37}} or {{champion:44}} have the same effect as long-range poke mages, they significantly swing the odds of victory","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2015-05-01T09:11:13.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like the new dash in aram is buffing melee's though.

Now this is instantly going to cop a lot of flack from people that are about to say or are saying in their head \"but i don't wanna play (champion x) i don't like them and i do better on all the ones i own. your idea is dumb cry cry cry\" and to that i say go play summoners where you can pick those champions you enjoy playing so much.\n\nif we limit aram to a select pool of champions its turns from being a lucky dip into being rummage through the box and pick something you already have and play frequently and can dominate on. now addressing the issue of why they don't have the entire champ pool available to them through leveling up and buying champs aram accounts. i know people and have come across many people that would have every carry/long range/high burst champ but none of the others now when i ask those people about why that is the case the usual response is is something along the lines of \"because they are strong and op in aram\" in relation to what op said in it needs a little balance in that a team like {{champion:37}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:45}} \nvs{{champion:131}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:268}} long story short we got shoved poked out healed and shielded so hard we lost almost instantly and engaging in any way shape or for of the word is point less (final score was 50-17 guess what team the 50 went to) im not saying \"heals are to strong in aram\" or \"omg nerf shields so bs\" im saying  the frequincy of those champions are way to common, and if you don't believe me ask yourself and even provide a screen shot of when was the last time you came up against a {{champion:83}},  or a {{champion:72}}. Now that's not saying they are bad i have had a lot of wins and just good matches in general on {{champion:83}} but the rate at witch we see those champs to the ones that fall in the \"op on aram\" basket is just ridiculous.\n\nnow the benefits of it besides not seeing as many of the same or the \"op aram champs\" people descoving champs they never knew they would of enjoyed or maybe had a bad game in summoners but enjoy them more in aram, leading to them enjoying playing and learning that champ. Don't just ride a bike at a park go out and explore is all im saying. prime example i have a mate that hated lee-sin because he got destroyed in a summoners he received it on a free to play week and he now owns it and every skin for it he loves lee in aram and its something he would happily play because he knows it better. \n\nall in all i doubt riot will see this because if they do its a bloody merical, and i doubt they will do it because hey why have some one buy one champ when we can have them make a smurf and buy these 20 champs again YAY MONEY. But aram isn't truly random if you are just picking from a select pool. random is having the chance to get anything not just the chance to get one of 10 adc's i own or the 10 mages i own because there's a better chance of the pool of 20 the the free to play champs and even if i get one of those guy im gonna dodge and log on my smurf.\n\nJust make aram truly random just make the whole roster available because right now its que up and hope to god you get some thing with huge range and scales hard with heals/shields or poke.","replies":[]}]}
