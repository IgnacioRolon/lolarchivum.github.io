I had friends check my profile and they can see games played on my account today whilst I was at work. \nMy account was hacked and it seems the hacker was using 3rd-Party applications which lead to my account being banned.\n\nI've already submitted a support ticket, but is there anything else I can do to make it more likely that my account will be restored? Should I apply for account recovery even though the hacker didn't change my password?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-02-06T11:46:11.348+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Change your password, the password for the associated email address, and any accounts that share those passwords now if you haven't already.\n2. Run an anti-virus scan on your computer.\n3. If you regularly play at public locations like internet cafes, check those PCs before you use them next time (both for viruses and for physical devices).\n\nChances are support will direct you to an account recovery ticket at some stage but just follow through with your initial ticket for now.\n\nBe aware there are certain circumstances that could result in the account being unrecoverable (e.g the account being shared, the intruder being a friend or family member, ownership of the account cannot be verified etc etc). They are relatively rare, but it is a possibility.","replies":[{"poster":"Arcade Gangster","date":"2020-02-15T06:32:55.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same problem and was wondering if my account can be recovered? Someone hacked me, I changed my password and I am not logged in anywhere else but now I have been banned and I'm quite upset since I didn't do anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-02-20T04:09:51.850+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry it took me so long to get back to you, I was away for a week!\n\nFollow the same process that OP did (submit an account recovery ticket to Player Support) and it should be all good (with a bit of patience and time). As I mentioned, there are exceptions, but generally such accounts  can be recovered.\n\nhttps://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}]}]}
