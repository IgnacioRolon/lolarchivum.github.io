Our team lost 1 won 1 yay! An improvement for clash could be having scrims against other clash teams with the same ban format and everything but the names aren&#039;t shown something like Summoner 1,2,3 etc. The scrims could be a 3-day thing where you play 2 games with your team a day in preparation for the knockout games. This is one feature which would make the game feel like more of pro scene in my opinion. What other suggestions do you guys think???","replies":[]}
