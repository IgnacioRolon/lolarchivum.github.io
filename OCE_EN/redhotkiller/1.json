I main top but can go anylane and play decently. I live in new Zealand (North island). I play this game for fun but can be quite competitive (Sometimes). I like to think that I&#039;m a pretty chill person and don&#039;t judge others by there skill level as they will  get better over time.The reason I want to make a team is because I don&#039;t like solo que as you get a lot of toxic players (And of course to have fun).\r\n\r\nTeam requirements\r\nAge: 14+\r\nMood:Humouress\r\nSkype or TeamSpeak (Pref Skype)\r\nThe ability to play everyday (afternoon)\r\nThe ability to have fun playing league\r\nThe ability to work as a team\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd me in game (I&#039;m not the best player in the world)\r\nHave a great day!","replies":[{"poster":"   zzy","date":"2016-02-10T10:29:48.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"adc mid sup add plz\nin nz ashvages","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spiritz","date":"2016-02-08T07:38:49.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: Support Lane\nAge: 21\nMains: ADC main but i wanna play on my support smurf and a Support.\n\nGot skype and a tone of 5s exp just looking to get Sup smurf up to Gold :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Abyswalker","date":"2016-02-07T08:27:03.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: Abyswalker\nAge: 18\nMains: Top/ Jg\nhave skype","replies":[]},{"poster":"Matthews","date":"2016-02-06T20:39:32.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi im interested in joining\nAge:15\nMains: Adc Jungle\nable to used comms\n\nIm like you sick of solo q and just wanting to have a bit of fun, Hit me up in game Matthews, or on here\n\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"RedHotKiller","date":"2016-02-06T21:36:31.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sent you a request in game","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Skrab","date":"2016-02-06T06:29:21.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I would love to join your team because i hate solo q as well. I have been playing casually for about 4 years. I like to metabreak and try weird build but i can be pretty serious if needed. I don't talk much unless required or someone talk to me first (LOL!).  I am a very tactical/strategical  person so i think a lot about team comp and each person strength so i know how i should play with anyone. I main support but i can play other role as well although it's going to be more supportive than carry.\n\nI can't play until next weekend because of my overseas job. Other than that, I can play afterwards almost everyday except Thursday from 10 AM to 5 PM and more at night after 9 PM.\n\nAdd me in game (Uniucky) if you want to form a team. \nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"RedHotKiller","date":"2016-02-06T07:53:45.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Skrab","date":"2016-02-06T14:41:14.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since we have 3 support main..
