My ping is consistently higher as if I am playing on NA, and is not spiking. It is not the type of ping where it says 200 and feels 9000, it actually feels as though I have slow connection to NA servers. As you can imagine and have experience (i&#039;m sure), this is pretty frustrating. I was just curious to see if anyone else has this issue tonight and who their providers are.","replies":[{"poster":"Fabi0thefabulous","date":"2015-04-16T12:20:13.912+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"and everyone in the game dcs ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2015-04-18T04:49:09.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm with Orcon in NZ.

Towards the end of a game it usually drops back to 46 which is pretty normal for me. iinet is my isp. I played a couple of games with my son and daughter this morning that were alright then in the 3rd game  the 3 of us had high ping...really hard to walk let alone do anything else. Another person in the team had high ping (800-1000) but 5th person was normal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DEviLkAm","date":"2015-04-16T13:37:29.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem but im with telstra, and pings with in this 2 months keep going up to 2XX","replies":[]},{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-04-16T12:14:36.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im not getting this but was getting the spikes of extreme lag, but its probably just optus being optus, i have to call then non-stop for them to fix my internet, i get really sick of it, just ring them up and complain to them, ask them what is going on.","replies":[]}]}
