He is very aggressive towards other animals and has come to the league to get his fill of there blood.\r\nKit:\r\nPassive: Gain Wool: As Mervin kills monsters and animal like champions, he gains stack/s of wool (champions, dragon and baron grant 5 wool, assists small and large monsters grant 1)(capped eat 50 wool) Each wool grants 1 attack damage and Mervin&#039;s skills have bonus effects at 35 stacks of wool.\r\nSkill 1 (Q): Baa! : Mervin shouts a mighty roar inflicting damage(60/100/140/180/220)+( %Attack damage)  in a cone if front of him. Once Mervin has 35+ stacks of wool his baa! becomes even mightier and now champions, monsters(excluding dragon and baron) and minions are too afraid to face him for (0.5/0.75/1/1.25/1.5) seconds forcing them to either stay still or run away from the beast.\r\nMana:50/60/65/70/75   Cool down: 12/11/10/9/8\r\nSkill 2 (W): Ram! : Mervin gains bonus movement increasing(fairly quickly) to (50/60/70/80/100) for 4 seconds but can only move in a straight line if he hits a champion knocks them up for 1 sec dealing (55/80/95/110/125)+(50% bonus attack damage) -(75/100/125/150/175)+(75% bonus attack damage), he is stoped by walls. Once Mervin has 35+ stacks of wool Mervin will lock onto nearby champs and start moving towards them in a straight line. \r\nMana: 60/70/80/90/100 Cool down:20/17/15/13/11\r\nSkill 3 (E) Ewe! : Selects a champion or large/epic monster and takes (10/15/20/25/30)% reduced damage from them and deal (10-15-20-25-30)+(10% bonus attack damage) bonus magic damage to them for 5 seconds.

Cannot be used more then once in the space of 40 seconds.  \r\n(Active) Mervin pride forces Mervin to display his beautiful form by turning his wool pink.

I tried to be the most original and creative I could in the moves/ kit but the scales and base stats are pretty much a copy of vi.\r\nHope you like the Duke of Woolsberg.","replies":[{"poster":"SilentXKiller","date":"2015-10-03T07:17:35.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Rock Lee I like the ideas of this champion, however if you have not noticed in your creation of this champion, I'm saying that he's not what the League needs. Think of it this way, there is going to be a champion named Mervin who is a sheep... No, i think you might need to change his name, appearance and race, I suggest Yordle and probably therefore change his abilities, plus there isn't a place on the League called Woolsberg, hope this helps, it might sound harsh, but personally this is what think. Cheers and please be sure to check my pages! I just posted a few! Have a great day! :D","replies":[{"poster":"Rock Lee","date":"2015-10-03T07:43:26.823+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There many champs similar to it, there's a bear a lion a dog a rat wolf cow fish \nI think it will be good change of pace from the recent complex champ being realised","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SilentXKiller","date":"2015-10-03T07:56:33.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I agree however, I think the sign of sheep/ram is already taken by Braum{{champion:201}} and the fact that it would be better to change his name since the name Mervin sounds weird, unlike Brand, obviously related to fire, Yasuo, sounds like Japanese like the character is, so all these champions' names have something to do with what they're are like, I think it's better to change the name of this champion and probably the description so that he doesn't sound too... non-aggressive. I mean like Mervin sounds too honest and weak, maybe Merlin or Morville or something, just ideas, man !!!","replies":[{"poster":"Rock Lee","date":"2015-10-03T12:11:22.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"honestly Mervin is a name that all shall fear plus MEEEERRRRRvin bra too gold too gold bra","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Conrad","date":"2015-10-03T11:16:28.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glorious","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rock Lee","date":"2015-10-03T07:36:23.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Baa ram eye mate Baa ram eye","replies":[]}]}
