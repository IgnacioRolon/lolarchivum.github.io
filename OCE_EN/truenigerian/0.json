He often has a lot of trouble reaching opponents such as {{champion:10}} , {{champion:17}} , {{champion:133}}  etc. Darius is a good fighter, but now I feel like his ability to engage in the top lane is much more difficult. He needs the ability to get to his opponents better. For example: if his opponent is in range to attack, Darius should be able to hook them rather than being bullied out of lane and feel useless for the rest of the laning phase. If he&#039;s being bullied, it should be due to having a difficult skill match up... not due to a complete kit disadvantage.","replies":[]}
