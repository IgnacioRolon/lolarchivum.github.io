Refusing to finish just to farm some more kills, EZ callouts in chat, letting the minions finish the nexus and stand around for style points I guess? You already won the game, oh and you're gonna be a jerk about it too, cool bro. Other scumbags doing this to you doesn't justify you doing it to someone else.
