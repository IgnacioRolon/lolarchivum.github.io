It just happened to me and the enemy were not a good bunch so i decided to make this post. the worst case that has ever happened to me is when i got matched with the same exact team 3 times in a row, this team included a certain player who was very toxic and annoying and also happened to be a platinum smurf. This has happened a lot in 5 queues and is really frustrating. My suggestion is to add a feature that allows players to say that they do not want to be matched with a certain summoner again or adjust matchmaking so it is impossible to be matched against the same person twice in a row or something along those lines, please riot at least respond to this post and please do something about it, it would be VERY appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Catspeare","date":"2016-03-29T08:53:34.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If that happened then there would probably be a couple of hundred trolls who would do that to everyone and thus stuff up the game. A better idea would be to place them in a priority, for instance, you could put said players in a low priority so unless it's extremely unfortunate, you probably wouldn't have to play with them again. Or alternatively if you were playing with a grand lad who you don't want to add but were fun to play with you could put them in a higher priority to play with them again. This priority could be reset every month or so, since if you have the unlikely Miss Fortune {{champion:21}}  (pun) to play with them again, you most likely won't remember them. However i have no idea how much work that would need and how many bugs that would create. Probably after Hextech's bugs are managed and the like. Good idea though. \n~Catspeare {{champion:268}}","replies":[]}]}
