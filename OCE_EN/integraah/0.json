I&#039;ve started to encounter more and more bot accounts in this gamemode making It harder to have genuine fun in that mode due to the amount of bots accounts just running in a dying to the other bots every game..... One of enemy bots managed a whooping 17/0/0....\n\nIt started with only one bot account, that&#039;s fine, i have 3 other human players who can play.. then it went up to 2... and the last Coop vs ai game I had.. I encountered 3 bots... me and the only other human players were left with that super fed champ... and nothing to defend ourselves with, it became a really stressful game... It&#039;s getting to the point where there is no reason for Co-op Vs AI when it&#039;s just going to be Co-op + Bots vs AI\n\nI&#039;m starting to think that those sites which are offering level 30 smurf accounts are the ones to blame for the ruining of Co-op Vs AI. Running programs which reenact player movements to trick the system. Still wondering why Riot Games haven&#039;t done anything about it yet.. \n\nThanks for reading my 5 cents.\nHighZedVelocity out","replies":[]}
