I&#039;ve been really getting into Renekton lately. That being said I&#039;ve looked up all his skins and Rune Wars was my favorite by far, the shop doesn&#039;t sell it so I&#039;m wondering why? and also how is this skin obtainable if you cannot buy it?\r\n\r\nThanks in Advance ~ Koresto","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-06-02T06:22:13.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They made it \"legacy\". Basically removed it from the everyday shop. It will come back during special events and sales but can't be directly purchased right now.\n\nIt is possible to get it randomly through a Mystery Skin Gift but its a very very long shot.","replies":[{"poster":"Koresto","date":"2016-06-02T13:22:47.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah that's a shame, thanks anyway! hopefully I can get it in the near future.","replies":[]}]}]}
