I think it&#039;d be reasonable to have it available more often so we have more chances to grind for the end of the season. Not to mention that Worlds knock out stages are on every weekend from here onwards, starting at 2pm AEST and for those who actually like watching the games also won&#039;t have time to play TT ranked.\r\n\r\nI think it&#039;s only fair for the last month of the season, I don&#039;t think queue times will be that affected especially since in order to get all the Victorious Orianna chromas you need to get Gold+ in 3 different queues, so I imagine more people would be motivated to play TT this time of year.\r\n\r\nAny chance this can happen?","replies":[]}
