I copy pasted what he was saying and took a screenshot and attatched it in the comment section in the report options. \r\n\r\nIs there any chance that this will be enough to get them punished? \r\n\r\nThanks, Best Teemo {{champion:17}}","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-09-02T12:48:10.151+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nSo back in the day when all reports were manually reviewed, the report comments would have been a great place to post stuff like that. Today we have the Instant Feedback though which doesn't read report comments (as far as I know).\n\nI'd say you're better off sending in a [**Riot** support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with your screenshots and evidence. Providing a link to the game where it happened in your [match history](http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/) is also really helpful.\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n>  **Just to clarify BTW:**\n> \n>  Even though report comments won't be read most of the time by the Instant Feedback system, that doesn't mean they're useless. \n> \n> Manual reviews done by actual humans still happen all the time, and the comments on reports are now really important for editing and fine tuning the Instant Feedback system itself. They also collect data through report comments to design projects like the new tribunal!\n\n> [This link](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/instant-feedback-powers) is really helpful if you want the full details.\n\nI hope this helps :)","replies":[{"poster":"Best Teemo","date":"2016-09-03T05:00:51.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it did thank you :)","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-09-03T07:16:15.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\nAwesome!
