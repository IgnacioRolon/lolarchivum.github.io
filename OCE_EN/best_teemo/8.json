I kept telling my friend who was playing Khazix not to worry and that we could come back and still win it. \n\nAfter winning that team fight we ended up getting baron which helped us gain back map control and the enemy team eventually surrendered. \n\nEnd score on Teemo: 14 - 2 - 8\n\nEnd Team scores: 36 - 30","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-18T08:13:37.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice work xD","replies":[]}]}
