I had a zilean one a while back that involved me running around the entire map whilst my team was dead and I had like 3 hp for most of it and I got killed 3 times by annie, leesin and ashe and I was running around for a good 2 minutes having 5 people chasing me rather than ending the game and eventually we won. Imo it's worse with zilean because you can continually lead them on, stun them slow them speed up run around dodging leesin qs and if you do get caught out you revive and stun them again, activate your talisman and run away at 1100+ movement speed and then just keep baiting with his irritating laugh and spam mastery 7 emote.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-25T00:12:09.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The kind of Teemo that reminds me of Kevin from Sin City.
