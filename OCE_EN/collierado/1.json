This left some players in \"ghost games\", where different parts of the server think you are in a game, when you are not.\n\nUnfortunately, there's no way for us to re-sync this information without restarting the entire OCE platform. It will eventually self-resolve, once those games expire, which in normal circumstances should take approximately 3 hours.\n\nTL;DR - it should be fixed for each of you within the next hour.","replies":[]}]}
