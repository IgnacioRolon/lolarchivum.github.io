She has a lot of power with Sated Devourer, and her dash (Q) and two slows (W+E) gives her some decent ganking potential too.\n\n[(My recent Fiora games. Still figuring out how to play her.)](http://i.imgur.com/Re01WC0.png)\n\nHowever, her camp clearing is very weak early-game, that I usually have to return to base every 3 Camps (to heal) because she has no sustain. It gets easier once you buy Devourer, but before that it is painful.\n\nFor those who don't know, Fiora's new passive lets her \"deal bonus true damage on 'Vitals' while receiving a small heal + ms boost in return\". I think this would be an awesome addition to help Fiora in the Jungle. The added damage and healing would let her clear camps for longer, and would probably make her a viable Jungler.\n\nRiot, please consider this!","replies":[{"poster":"Truegolddigger","date":"2015-08-09T12:21:05.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They probably won't do this because they probably don't want Fiora to be a jungler.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-08-09T12:06:39.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree this should happen even if only on the large monsters to make it less visually confusing (taking into account what Talon12 has said)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-08T11:15:39.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that would be way too confusing, so many vitals, tit would have to be they show up after you hit a monster, and rito is too lazy to do that, just time your w to block their damage, you can block a whole camp worth of damage if you time it right (yes her w blocks monster damage still, she is also way better at baron solo now aswell)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-08-08T04:01:34.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you really want to jungle as Fiora you'll come up with something that works.\n\nHowever yes, it would be nice if her passive worked on jungle minions.","replies":[]}]}
