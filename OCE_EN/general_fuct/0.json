Let me tell you a story.\n\nWhen I first started playing League I was on the NA server, and like every other new player I got told not to go straight into ranked because I wouldn't be good enough and I'd just make the game hell for all the better players trying to climb. Like every other new player I was arrogant enough not to listen to everyone else. Following my placements I was put into Bronze I and even though I thought I deserved better, I was happy as it meant I was in a position that should be relatively easy to climb out. Fast forward 2 weeks and I was in Bronze II, flustered because I couldn't see what was possibly going wrong with MY game and why I was the the one getting dropped because of trolls/ragers etc. You know the drill. I transferred to OCE and got dropped into Bronze IV, devastated and ashamed I took the natural path of all hard-done-by noobs and fell prey to the toxicity of the game and proceeded to rage and troll as all around me did. And then I had this epiphany: Maybe I wasn't doing good at this game because I'm not good at this game. My head proceeded to explode, I feel onto the floor in a puddle of blood, guts, brains, semen, and (most importantly) brilliance. From that day forward I decided that maybe good players were good because they focused on being good, not the little things of the game like the pathetic lower-echelons bad attitudes. In 2 weeks I hit S1, the server ticked over into pre-season before I could finish my last promo game into Gold. Bad-luck-Brian, but I didn't let it get me down. S4 I got put back into Silver, bummed but determined I decided 'yolo-swag ima rank just high enough to get the sick-ass skin.'. The last 3 weeks I decided I wanted Plat, and despite the constant trolling that, and this may come as a surprise to low-elo players, does still happen in mid-high elo, I hit Plat. I had two weeks to spare.\n\nAll of the friends I still play with from back when I was low-elo help me realise that the only thing that separates me from them is my ability to take responsibility. The single most important skill one needs have to climb the ranks in LoL is the ability to say, 'You know what, guys? That was my fault.'\n\nThe toxicity can be used to learn that the only thing you need to do to improve is, strangely enough, improve, and it's as simple as that. \nLeague has taught me how to improve at anything in life, and I say with all the honesty I can muster: Thank you, trolls. You've made me a better person.\n\n\nI hope you can learn these lessons on your own, OP. Good luck, my friend. :)","replies":[{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2014-12-26T14:17:35.230+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Logged in to say: Well said, Fgt.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2014-12-26T04:49:26.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What \"abuse\" are you receiving?\n\nI can't think of a time i have received abuse for losing, because lets face it \"gg2ez\" and %%%% like it isn't abuse, it's people pretending they are good.\n\nI have had abuse for winning but i just laugh it off.","replies":[{"poster":"Child","date":"2014-12-26T05:11:43.942+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"gg2ez, gg easy and the sort are all reportable anyway","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2014-12-26T04:44:08.868+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stop playing LoL until you turn 13+ then you might be able to ignore the extreme toxic abuse such as \"gg 2ez\" and \"ez game ez life\".","replies":[{"poster":"General Fuct","date":"2015-01-28T02:47:33.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why should we have to ignore breaches to the summoners code?
