The best way to do these kinds of things is in a premade 5 team (made possible by dynamic que), so you can communicate using voice as well as minimize the flame from people that aren't in on the new meta you are creating. \n\nQue times as premades are a whole different ball game, as the system tried to match 4/5 premades with other 4/5 premades (due to the perceived advantage of voice chat)\n\nOn the whole super long wait time topic, its mainly because people want to play carry roles.\n\n* Take x number of people online, in the same mmr bracket, and queuing at a certain time (which in OCE is bound to be tiny, especially with more and more people turning to norms due to the wait times/ \"potato teams\"),\n* take half away for being premade (the best way to play the game)\n* then take away another 3/5 who have their primary/secondary as a mix of mid/top (the proportion of qued players in this category probably goes up, as the elo goes down)\n* then you have the remaining players as potential que partners (assuming they are split evenly amongst the 3 remaining roles (which in itself, is highly unlikely)\n\nWhat I'm tying to say here, is that getting your primary isn't so much about waiting an extra couple of minutes on top of the already ridic que times, its about being the lucky one in a mess of numbers.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2016-02-24T03:43:56.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess so.
