I can't be the only person who hates checking the damage board (the thing that you click to see how much damage who did what) after your death to see that Revive did 89 magic dmg and even though it was a teamfight, the minions still managed to do 180 physical dmg and get the assist. I don't know about anyone else, but i have had it with the horrible stats that this board is showing after a death. Like it's tolerable... but Riot wants to make it a clearer game and i think this is a big problem. Especially over time.\r\n\r\nThere's another issue with pink wards in the dragon pit. It is possible to put a pink ward RIGHT in the centre of the pit so when the enemy comes to do dragon you have full vision of it until the dragon dies (because the hitbox overlaps and it is literally impossible to destroy the ward before you kill the dragon.. So this puts the team at a huge disadvantage because they can't do a sneaky dragon. Perhaps the same thhing can happen with Baron? I haven't tried that. Moving on.\r\n\r\nAnother \"BUG.\" That crab in the river means that Teemo CAN NOT shroom anywhere in the river because the crab likes to walk over them. So after you put one down in the bush to control dragon area it just walks through it for nor eason.. I propose that the shrooms only activate on the bug if recently placves from 5 seconds to 20 seconds.. If you play Teemo it's pretty annoying (good for you haters of course.) \r\n\r\nOne last thing (my opinion)... I think Sions ult should have a larger hitbox or the ability to charge up your q while sprinting with the ult because it is just too dam unlikely in league to hit someone. It literally limits what Sion is good for because all he can do is run down a lane.. and with any luck the enemy team won't see him coming. Like think about how agile the characters in League are..... Does anyone agree? I think he needs some sort of readjustment. Thanks, peace out.\r\n**","replies":[{"poster":"Silver5aruman","date":"2014-12-09T13:02:25.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo is still quite a strong champion, and the crab thing not being affected by them doesn't make sense.
