At the moment I am playing league at a mates place on his whole set up. The main problem is that he doesn't want me to change any of his key bindings etc etc which is annoying because he is a level 23 noobcake and has the weirdest set up that has random keys all over the place.. It would be good if we could save our key binding profile because usually when i come over I don't have my keyboard and mouse in my back pocket.
