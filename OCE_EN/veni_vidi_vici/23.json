Like every single weapon, even Nami's stick.. even a simple Nidalee or Pantheon spear, yet Vi's gauntlets are always forgotten :'( Her gauntlets are the coolest weapons ever.. I am planning on making a 3D printed figurine of her and maybe a keychain of her gloves to  put on my mirror in my car or something. Please attend to this.. Thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-01-27T22:44:23.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There definitely aren't\n> [{quoted}](name=VENI VIDI VICI,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=OafQAgq9,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-01-27T15:54:31.858+0000)\n>\n> all the weapons\n\nPresent in the music video, i didn't see darius's axe?

Her fists get forgotten just like swains peg leg etc and gangplanks pistol and alot of others.
