I was unable to screenshot the chat but got a few pics of the hate speech with my ipod (lol). I did send a report after game for hate speech. Is that enough for Riot to recognize?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-12-16T22:03:00.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I think it comes down to what you feel is enough in this situation. If you don't think the post-game reporting system is sufficient, sent Riot a support ticket. At least that way you know, for sure, that it's getting looked at instead of getting chucked around a system for several more games while they rack up enough reports for something to happen.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-12-17T04:00:43.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that's what I think. A case like this should be looked at straight away. Rather than be dealt with by system.
