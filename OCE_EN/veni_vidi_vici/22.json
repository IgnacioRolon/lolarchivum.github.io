It is an extremely tough lane with their jungler always top feeding the cho. To make things worse: if you get silenced while your poison is on; you can&#039;t turn it off! So if you&#039;re low as hell on mana and you&#039;re about to turn off poison but get silenced.. You lose a whoooooole lot of power!","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-11-24T04:49:11.550+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's almost as if Cho'Gath counters Singed, NO WAY!\n\nBut seriously don't be stupid, counterpicks exist and Cho'Gath is one of those champs that sustains Singed's damage, has good CC and just denies him in general, by your dumb logic Singed should be good verse every champ which shows you know nothing about balance. Will also add a junglers job is to screw your lane up so to call Singed weak and blame Cho'Gath all because the jungler was doing his job is idiotic.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-11-24T05:11:22.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Noway!! Really?\n\nNice man. Just straight up attack and demean my post. Logical fallacy all over bruhs. Keep blowing shit out of proportion.\n\nRead the post. I wasn't blaming junglers or cho gath or singeds weaknesses/strengths. All I was highlighting is silence makes it so he can't turn his poison [OFF] which feels unnatural.","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-11-24T13:27:26.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How old are you? I didn't \"attack\" you, if you think telling you to not be stupid and calling your logic dumb is attacking then you have some growing up to do, you big cry baby.\n\nWell that's a lie because why would you even mention those other things? You got outplayed by a Cho'Gath and their jungler so you come to the forum complaining about that, then you proceed to bitch about Cho's silence for simply doing what it was designed to do which is stop you from using abilities, want to avoid this in the future? Get better, simple.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-11-25T03:23:16.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha ok big guy. You're not worth the keystrokes.
