Everyone and anyone you know is a c@nt. In fact I just got off the phone with my mate and I said to him \" How ya going C \"\nI understand you can use it in a negative light and so on.

Just like saying KYS. But once you start going into the slang and say \" We don't stand for that in USA / Russia / Beer { Yes there is a place called Beer } doesn't mean that in Australia it means the same thing.\n\nTo help people understand.. In Aus if you call a black person an [ABBO](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=abbo).. That is callified as racist. \nBut if you call someone a [gringo](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gringo)..
