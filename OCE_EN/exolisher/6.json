Is this normal or because there is only one player and it is on the bottom base (i haven&#039;t tried being on the top base yet to test it out)\r\nOnly the top turret for Blue Base was destroyed, Mid being half hp, and bot around 1/3 hp (or the low hp turret icon) and as for Red Base, if i remember correctly all 6 or 5 outer turret were already destroyed (this was about 30 mins in game)\r\n\r\nComment down below if this was because i was playing solo on Blue Side or complete other reason. If that was normal wouldn&#039;t Blue Side have more chance of wining ----- a bit unfair","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-01-06T11:25:18.018+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's got nothing to do with one side having an \"innate advantage\".\n\nThing is, there are many factors that will affect this and the only way to see which side has an advantage (if any) would be by having hundreds, if not thousands, of matches run without champion interference. After all, even things as simple as two minions in the first wave focusing the same target can snowball the game into a one-sided match.\n\nYou could jump onto YouTube to find a great many videos on this subject, most of which will only cover one match. You'll then find a great many people claiming that X side has an innate advantage based on what they did, and you'll more than likely find that there will be about the same number of claims for each side.","replies":[{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2017-01-06T13:39:57.125+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've done this a bunch of times in custom games with no one interfering with top or bot. Blue seems to have a slight higher rate of being pushed bot side, while red has a higher rate being pushed top. Idk if this was just chance, but its whats happened in my experience.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-01-06T11:16:09.613+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Greetings Exolisher,\n\nAs a quick note always keep in mind there might be auras or blocking Minions pathing that may occur that you might not notice that can effect this.\n\nHowever if you are look for a bit more information as far as how Minions work, Riot recently did a Dev Blog on how the AI of Minions work. It was a very interesting read going on about waypoints, agro in the river and first wave having slightly different behaviour. If you are interested in learning more about Minions and if you are going to do some experiments with this I would highly suggest a read.\n\nHere is a link:\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/qRHotV9k-minion-ai-rules-documentation\n\nI hope that this helps. If you do some experimenting let me know what you find out it'll be interesting.\n\n~Elam","replies":[]},{"poster":"EXOLISHER","date":"2017-01-06T08:24:18.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't go and read much of the post in Boards, so if this was already posted and answered (sorry didn't intend to copy) and please share the link in the comment tnx ^^","replies":[]}]}
