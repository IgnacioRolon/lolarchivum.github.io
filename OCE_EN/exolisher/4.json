LOL\n\nMMR is based on a lot of things.. Wards / Damage amount / Deaths / Kills / CSing and champion you play and so on.\nNot just win or lose. That is so failed in it's self it isn't funny.\n\nLets say for a second you are playing very easy champion to play. Lets say Teemo. You did the most damage and died the least.\nBut what you didn't do is buy wards / CS very well and you have less then 20% KP and also your APM was about 40.\nWhen team fights happen you were off cuddling the dragon and whispering in it's ear. \n\nAll this can have effect on your MMR. Don't worry about win or lose. Just worry about how well you were CSing , Warding, Damage taken, Damage dealt and so on. MMR is based on you. Not the team.","replies":[{"poster":"tts01008","date":"2017-11-13T13:20:47.592+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide#q2\nIt is a bit more complicated than simple win rate, but you are definitely wrong about MMR.

They have the ability to track in-game performance per role as well which would lead me to believe they factor that into MMR.","replies":[]}]}]}
