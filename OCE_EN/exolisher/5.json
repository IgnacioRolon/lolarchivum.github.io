And doesn&#039;t have to adapt to the changes since they just started.\n\n&bull; **Veterans**: (To me players from S1-4 or 5) More than likely own every champion. And by now, Know their Play-style and/or Compatible Champions and are experience to changes and can adapt easily.\n\n&bull; **Intermediate**: (To me, players from S5 or 6-7) Mostly, from having a reasonable Champion pool up to having quite a few. And now are unable to purchase new champions, since they had to spend more on Runes and Rune Pages; More than likely didn&#039;t save IP or buy champions because the &#039;removal of earning currency&#039; wasn&#039;t widespread or clearly announced, and only a handful of PBE players know (not even Streamers mentioned about it).\n\nI consider my self an Intermediate player (Started around S6 but started to actually play around late S6), and have a &#039;Main&#039; Champion and Role. and also know how to play other few for when I get auto-filled in Draft Pick, or didn&#039;t get my role in Blind Pick. But there are still a bit of a problem. One example is where I found myself to be better at playing Sejuani compared to the champions I own and use for Jungle (I mainly play ADC and SUP).\n\n>  I think what the main problem is not that we **don&#039;t earn Currency**, but on **Lacking Champion Pool, or not owning Champions we&#039;re most compatible with**. Currency (both BE/RP) doesn&#039;t have a massive impact in League of Legends. At most It&#039;s just used for Skins, Chromas, Icons... &#039;Appearances&#039;, which have no impact on the game (or gameplay) at all (may hype you up but still no changes to the game/gameplay).\n\nA suitable change can be to easily get more champions, since many players don&#039;t play as much compared to others and may take long to even get new champions. Not much of an example but say my alternative account, (I started to actually play League of Legends around late S6) I made the account around S7, mainly for &#039;testing things&#039; and rarely played on it. It&#039;s Lv. 30 but only own about 6 Champions and only 1 I really know how to play (I was trying to see if I&#039;d like mid or jungle, that&#039;s why no champions are the same with this acc).\n\n> Also, I&#039;d like to add a comment on the New Runes, their amazing, it let players deep into their play-style, compared to old system which are mainly generalized or &#039;small buffs&#039;. As for the rune pages, No one should really need a lot, except for the &#039;last second change&#039; incidents. Similar to item builds, players should know their Rune set easily, like in the old mastery system, how players can quickly and easily change mastery in a matter of second (Even now I just use 1 page out of 3 + the pre-sets), and rune pages back then were Only Needed since they can&#039;t be edited in Champion Select. Adding to that, correct me if wrong, players have 30 Seconds to lock (more if Draft especially &#039;last pick&#039; players) and another 30 before playing, at least an entire Minute to create a Rune setup. (take me about 5 sec to set rune and change summoners)\n\nHmm don&#039;t mind this but the feedback and complains are just &quot;Exaggerated&quot;, If you think about it (what I just wrote above). Players can use and survive with 1 Rune Page, and Currency has barely any impact in LoL (understand that Riot Games Employers also need money). \n\n~~Also if you don&#039;t mind, Share it around if you agree on what I just said. So it can calm the community (or a player) a bit or something, the last paragraph at least xD ~~ \nI'm also interested on what your opinions are :}{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-23T10:02:10.419+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And adding to that I think a big issue is that drops are randomised, requiring either a ridiculously long grind to even have a chance at something or dropping a sh!t tonne of cash to get it faster.\n\nTherein lies the real issue - this will be a problem for a lot of teenagers with poor impulse control. It is like any sort of gambling - the house never loses. Only in this kind of gambling, there is only a virtual return that will in time be utterly valueless. So not only is it gambling for a small chance to \"win\", the thing you win has a non-existant, virtual cosmetic value which will expire.\n\nIt preys on people not being able to control their spending and uses the same psychology as any sort of compulsive gambling.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-21T22:03:19.424+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The new system punishes new players by forcing $ for champs by severely restricting growth of champ pool.
