Instead of searching for the item name, it will be more efficient to locate it instantly in your set and yous press/buy it, especially if you need a quick stop, let say Ekko, right click an item after recall then instantly ult back to join fight? or if you forgot an item name, instead of searching for its image or going through items one by one; long sword&gt;tiamat&gt; hydra. (Especially for the meta players who don&#039;t follow recommended items, they can just right click the item and buy it straight away)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pce Out~","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-11-11T08:27:04.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty sure they've said somewhere that item sets are being removed.\n\nedit: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/client-update/article/4ac7a0bc-8847-40cd-8efb-aa5aa3a660f4\n\n>  Will the open beta be missing any features from the legacy client?\n> \nJust a couple at the start.
