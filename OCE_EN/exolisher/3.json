Even though it stays uncoloured, once in game my Mastery Keystone shows that i chose a mastery (and it is working - colossus and thunder lord), however, back in Champion Select it was uncolourd as if it wasn&#039;t picked. Also, when i press Reset Points, the selected (coloured) mastery icons remains, but when selecting another mastery icon, it will not show colour but the sound can be heared, but the previous selected mastery wont change colour. \nIs this a Game Bug (Visual Error) or PC Error?\n\nEdit: This is in Alpha Client","replies":[]}
