As has already been mentioned, Lethality (and Armour Pen) will only apply to basic attacks, since all of Kat's abilities deal Magic Damage. A better idea is an AP biased hybrid, which *should* work well with the Hextech Gunblade, which will also give you sustain from the passive (I have a large tendency to use Hextech Gunblade whenever I use Kat). Personally, I find Luden's Echo to be a good 2nd/3rd item.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vhaegor","date":"2016-11-17T13:03:41.301+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"don't buy lethality items on Katarina, they don't work on anything but her autoattacks.
