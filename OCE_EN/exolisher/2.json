Is it possible to suggest something like this to Riot Games?\n\nSome players Disconnect (or Quit) in the first 0-5 mins, and it really is annoying and a waste of time, especially since you can&#039;t &quot;remake&quot; because they were in-game (sometimes just ~30 sec, like I had today).I thought it&#039;ll be good if &quot;remake&quot; will detect an inactive/disconnected player up to a certain time and be able to remake, especially if they where in-game then disconnected (and  your in RANK queue). a solid 15 min of free jungle and ganks for the enemy...and you can&#039;t imagine the rest\n\njust wanna throw this in too, in my other account (same league/rank  so not really a smurf in my opinion) I had 4 players dc'ed around 4 min and i had to wait till 15 min to leave without getting a penalty...","replies":[]}
