It keeps telling me that i've entered an incorrect combination of user/pass but the thing is when i go onto the retrieve account on the support page it literally says my account user dosent exist??! iv been playing league for over 7 years and this is the first time iv come across anything like this. \r\nAlso yes iv checked that my region is correct.\r\ncrucial information: the account im trying to log in is my secondary league account, it was made with another email address which i have forgotten the username to the email. if given the user to my email account i would be able to log in because i know my passwords. I've submitted tickets but riot does'nt really have anything to support a problem such as the rediculous situation i am in. pPs guys i dont want to start a new account and level back upto 30 again without all my loot and skins etc.","replies":[]}
