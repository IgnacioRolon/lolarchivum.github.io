In lane Veigar can get really punished by mages that outrange him (think vlekoz, xerath, syndra, zoe, annivia, ziggs) or get outplayed by champions with invulnerability or high mobility mechanics (Fizz, Kassadin, Leblanc, Vlad, Zilean, Zed). He also typically is rather slow at roaming and he aims to scale into midgame teamfights (free ap from stacks is actually most impactful during midgame), meaning his roams are easily either matched or countered by vision control.\n\nVeigar ult's damage is also very dependant on missing hp, meaning his 'desperate' combo is literally just q+ult, which requires alot of ap and is mainly used against squishies and gets shut down hard by banshees. Similarly banshees veil can save you from getting caught and combo'd by veigars full e-w-q-r 'DIE' combo.\n\nand if all else fails, you can always ban him, your team has 5 bans. Veigar isn't really overpowered but more niche frustrating, and again, Banshees, Edge of Night, Zhonias, ect... ways to negate his rotation or cc, go along way in making veigar's combo managable, and veigar is very vulnerable to being outranged since he has no sustain or mobility tools and his range is middling compared to other mages.","replies":[{"poster":"AceFunHouse","date":"2018-03-21T05:00:33.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll be surer to keep this in mind thanks","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-03-25T06:39:22.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Veigar is like my guilty pleasure.
