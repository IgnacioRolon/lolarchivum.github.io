At the moment we have a solid bot-lane and Jungle but we are lacking Solo-laners. The main thing we are looking for is the ability to be a team player and communicate well so we can focus our efforts, have more fun and get better results. Thus climbing together as fast as possible! {{item:3270}} \r\n\r\nIf you would like to play with us, leave your IGN, the lane you want to play in and some of the main champions you play in that role in a comment and we will get back to you for a game or two when we are all online. The hours we mostly play are late-night to early morning so if that works for you, even better. And one more thing, if you have a duo that plays in the other role we are looking for and is also looking for a team that would be even better! :D  (synergy!)","replies":[{"poster":"Rothus555","date":"2015-03-05T11:41:54.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN : Rothus555\nRank: G4\nLane: top or mid (prefer top)","replies":[]},{"poster":"KING OF THE APES","date":"2015-03-02T20:44:37.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN : KING OF THE APES\n\nRank: S3\n\nLane: Top or Mid\n\nChamps: Top: Lissandra, Irelia, Tryndamere, Nasus, Vlad, Darius, Garen, Jayce, J4, Malphite, Maokai, Riven, Swain\n               Mid: Lissandra, Nidalee, Annie, Ahri, LB, Syndra, Orianna","replies":[]},{"poster":"Master DuSt","date":"2015-03-02T02:29:55.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN : DuSt235\nRank : bronze 4 (plays at top silver level) [was silver 2 in season 3]\nLane : mid\nChamps : viktor, yas, ezreal, ziggs, heim and swain (learning more currently)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Master DuSt","date":"2015-03-02T02:24:21.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN : DuSt235\nRank : bronze 4 (plays at silver 2 lvl i am told)\nLane : mid\nChamps : ziggs, Viktor, Ezreal, Fizz and swain","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2015-03-02T06:30:41.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"IGN: ImDuhN00b \nRank: Silver 2 now, Silver 3 last season \nLane: Top or Mid\nChampions: Champion pool is pretty big even ones that don't really see doing mid lane but works like sona, elise, sejuani etc.\nTop {{champion:14}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:122}}  Are ones i play more then others but i can play just about every top champion well\nMid {{champion:112}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:76}}  ^ But can play mostly all mid champions well.\nThank you for your time","replies":[]},{"poster":"lost chapter","date":"2015-03-01T15:08:37.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"IGN : FBI Robin\nRank : Silver 1 \nLane - mid - champs-yasuo, ahri, zed, nidalee, orianna","replies":[]},{"poster":"Istehz","date":"2015-03-01T10:26:25.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"IGN: Istezz\n\nRank: Gold 4\n\nLane - Mid - Mid Champs: Ahri, Orianna, Nidalee, Cass, Annie, Zed, Yasuo, LB and Swain","replies":[]},{"poster":"Prt","date":"2015-03-01T07:22:44.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"IGN \"Prt\"\n\nMain Mid.
