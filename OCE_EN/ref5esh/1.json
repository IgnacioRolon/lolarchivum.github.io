Last year I was very active, working with high-level soloQ teams to newly formed ones looking to climb and improve. I also worked with multiple players from a wide range of ranks, assisting them with things like lane matchups, teamfighting and decision-making. I have been able to deliver feedback in both written form through documents and verbally through Skype or Discord (or a combination of both).\n\nFor me, this comes from a passion of the game and eagerness to see others improve. At the same time i am always looking to improve my own skillset, and thrive on testing myself and learning from others.\n\nWhether you&#039;re a Bronze player looking to climb to Silver, or an amateur team wanting to make the pro circuit, contact me here or in-game (**REF5ESH**) if you are interested!","replies":[{"poster":"Quixotic","date":"2017-04-24T13:20:44.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wtf ur gold 1 lol","replies":[{"poster":"REF5ESH","date":"2017-04-25T03:20:28.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I watch games more than I play, if rank is that important to you.","replies":[{"poster":"Quixotic","date":"2017-04-26T04:33:57.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have played 150 games with a 50% win rate you are where you belong lol","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-04-23T11:05:56.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How much do you charge???","replies":[{"poster":"REF5ESH","date":"2017-04-23T11:21:58.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In terms of payment, the first couple of sessions are free!
