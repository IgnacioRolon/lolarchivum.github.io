Having seen success from most of my players, this has allowed me to not only understand League of Legends better, but also improve my methods of breaking down gameplay into useful feedback for players to improve on. I have had experience in both delivering verbal feedback while spectating, and written feedback from watching replays.\n\nWhat I can offer your team:\n- Creating team compositions\n- Strategies through picks and bans\n- Analysis of all stages of the game\n- Teamfight breakdowns\n- Individual player analysis\n- Post-game feedback to improve future matches\n\nConfident in my abilities, and eager to improve myself as an analyst, I am looking for a team to work with. This will be completely free-of-charge, as long as the workload is appropriate. If you are apart of a RANKED team and are interested, please reply to this post and we'll discuss details.\n\nThanks for your time!","replies":[{"poster":"bluz0r","date":"2016-03-09T12:30:55.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Chavez,\n\nI have added you in game but I am looking for an analyst for my ranked team.\n\nWe are Diamond+ and practice regularly.
