Whether you&#039;re an organised team looking for a fresh perspective on your games, or just a SoloQ player wanting to improve your game, I&#039;d love to help out. I&#039;ve been a Gold/Platinum player for multiple seasons and have a good understanding of the game, enough to know where improvement can be made.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve worked with other players and local teams in the past (nothing too serious) and have helped them improve themselves through both VoD review and individual player analysis. In turn, this has helped me become better at breaking fundamentals down and being able to give helpful advice. I&#039;m still learning the in&#039;s and out&#039;s on doing analysis and giving useful feedback, but am slowly improving.\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re interested in having me look at your games, reply here or add me on the client (OCE): REF5ESH","replies":[{"poster":"Dunk Master RR","date":"2016-01-30T13:03:24.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a solo q b5.
