I am an ADC main, with a plethora of champions up my sleeve (Lucian, Jinx, Kaisa, Xayah, Trist to name a few). I can also play most roles, with top being my weakest. I am decent in the jungle with champions such as lee sin and nocturne. I am also looking to make my own team, but am looking to join one too. Add me for details. Thanks","replies":[]}
