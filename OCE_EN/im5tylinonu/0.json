I don&#039;t know how anyone with eyes can&#039;t see how they have butchered what was a great skin and the only reason they are getting away with it is because Galio doesn&#039;t have the fanbase of say Ree Sin.  Yes they might of changed the colour again to green but the old effects weren&#039;t just green, but more of a blue-green rainbow.  The effects were slightly different too but now they are the exact same as the rest except for the colour.  IMO Gatekeeper Galio should be left exactly as it is while the others are updated because Riot is doing a disservice to those of us who shelled out our money for that skin.  \r\n\r\nCurrent (old version):\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hJ5YHOEty8\r\n\r\nPBE (Bad) Version:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDooT8VHUbM","replies":[{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-18T09:07:10.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's Galio who gibs a shit","replies":[]},{"poster":"BadLuckFollowsMe","date":"2015-06-17T22:30:17.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh, from what I can see they sacrificed a slight blue tint for a better looking q and a far better ult. Though the new shield is kind of lacking. Nowhere near a disgrace, absolutely not butchered, but it certainly could cause a difference in personal preference. Hardly a change worthy of a forum post though.","replies":[]}]}
