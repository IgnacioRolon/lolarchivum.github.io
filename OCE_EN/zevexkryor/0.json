Same with Vayne, with the new trending vayne build she does broken damage with that shiv and assassin build? and then jayce...where do I begin? so much damage, you might say his late game is not that good but CAN BE good if he has the right items...why, these champs with &quot;skill&quot; got buff and now meta except Vayne but I bet she will be meta soon.","replies":[{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2016-11-10T16:19:27.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game state in it's entirety is a mess at the moment.
