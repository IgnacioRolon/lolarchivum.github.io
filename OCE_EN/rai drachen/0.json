(Vi also helped on pretty much every objective, many more than i did) so we can be fairly confident that she played better than i did. Yet she was ranked not 1 but 2 whole tiers below me, i got an S+ and she got an S-\n\nPicture 2:\nI was Taric, i had less kills than anivia, infinite more deaths, but i did have more assists. again i got less CS and less gold. She had a Perfect game (the definition of 'perfect game' being a game where you didn't die once.) and yet i get an S+ (for what, lets be honest is a very average support KDA) and she only gets an S- (for what is quite a good KDA for a squishy mage at 25 mins) \nAlso look at Ashe's score... she didn't get an S at all. and her score is way better than bot mine and Anivia's.\n\nIt is very clear that some roles are biast in champion mastery, support being one of them. \n\nSo i dare you to try and tell me now that you need a perfect game and 300 CS to get an S (cos i never got either in those games and i got S+ in both.) \n\nThe system doesn't treat roles equally, it is very very hard to get an S with an ADC or assassin, and piss easy to get it with a support.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-05-31T01:41:55.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**The system is based on the champion played in the role they are being played in, comparing the player's end game stats to the average end game stats of the same champion in the same role.**  \n\n* It doesnt go \"oh look a support, lets go easy on them with the things needed to get an s\". \n* Likewise, it doesnt go \"an assassin?!? we should make it near impossible to get a high grade mawahahaha\".\n\nAnnie top, Annie mid and Annie support could all have the exact same score/gold/objective assists at the end of the game and will still each get different grades. \n\nThe reason it is harder to get an S with an adc or an assassin, is because there are more people playing them and getting really really good scores. Normally these kinds of scores would be anomalous and balanced out by players also having really really bad scores, but it seems the more snowball type of champions (e.g. not supports or tanks) are having more good games than bad games played and pushing the grade boundaries far up.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"rai drachen","date":"2016-05-30T08:13:45.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lord thats exactly what im talking about first time playing nami i got an s plus but kha who im alot better at its hard to even get an a+","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-05-30T11:29:07.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because Kha'Zix is very popular, and a lot of people play better than 11-3-2, and I'm guessing your jungle farm wasn't past 250, so it grades you accordingly. \n\nBtw Kha has a 10.6% play rate so he isn't uncommon...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-05-30T08:04:25.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rankings are also more lenient on certain types of champions (god knows why) \nfor example, you can wander aimlessly around the map for 40 mins doing practically nothing as a sup/tank champ and get an S most games. \n\nbut if you're playing an assassin... well.. good fucking luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"rai drachen","date":"2016-05-30T08:00:16.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so help dragon baron/herld towers and wards all work towards it? this i never knew","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-05-30T07:55:22.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"kda isnt everything\n\nplace wards, clear wards, get assists, participate in team fights, secure objectives, get farm.\n\nthats how you get an s","replies":[]},{"poster":"rai drachen","date":"2016-05-30T07:21:20.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there have been times where i have carried teams i have never gotten an s of any class on a kha","replies":[]}]}
