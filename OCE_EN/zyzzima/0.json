OCE gets stuff first (or close to) so generally around patch days some server transfers are unavailable until those regions catch up.\n\nNot sure if this is the case here since I don't remember when the last patch was, but give it a day or two and it should be available again.\n\nThat said, it looks like OCE to LAN is available, so I don't see why LAN to OCE wouldn't be.","replies":[]}]}
