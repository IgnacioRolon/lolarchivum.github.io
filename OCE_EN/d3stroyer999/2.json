But what about katarina? A fed katarina can destroy everyone on the enemy team, what about counter play for her? I know that riot are adding windows in her kill pattern but this is surly not enough as they are giving her &#039;significantly higher  mobility&#039; as quoted by riot Beluga Whale.  And to top it all off, now she will be more deadlier in her laning phase. How is this going to make healthy gameplay??!!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-10-17T07:55:12.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love how they think Kat will be more deadly in her laning phase xD\n\natm, she just spams her dagger from max range as many times as she likes, and then just jumps on your face. \n\nI'm not sure how it can get any riskier for her opponent than the constant looming threat of sudden death...","replies":[{"poster":"TwoHeadedFreak","date":"2016-11-13T20:49:24.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=d65EnkAY,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-10-17T07:55:12.245+0000)\n>\n> I love how they think Kat will be more deadly in her laning phase xD\n> \n> atm, she just spams her dagger from max range as many times as she likes, and then just jumps on your face. \n> \n> I&#x27;m not sure how it can get any riskier for her opponent than the constant looming threat of sudden death...\n\nEkko destroys Kat.
