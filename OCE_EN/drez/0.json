The noxus assassin looked up and saw a white flurry disappear into the trees. She did see clothing, so it left her confused. Was it a human, or an animal? The assassin bounced into the trees and chased after the creature. She could see it&rsquo;s white tails and what seemed like human legs as they swiftly moved through the trees. Clearly, the thing had a very good understanding of her surroundings, like any assassin should. The person/creature jumped out of the trees and into a grassy field. The noxian followed her into said field, still cautious as always. The being turned around to face the assassin. It was definitely an Ionian woman, average height and bmi. The assassin also noted that the other assassin (the Noxian assumed that the Ionian was an assassin) was dressed rather scantily in comparison to most Ionians, but the clothes were still remnant of Ionian clothing.\n\n&ldquo;You Noxians are very peculiar in my eyes. I don&rsquo;t understand why you recognize only the value of a person through merely their military capabilities and possibilities ,&rdquo; said the Ionian.\n\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand why you Ionians have different clans and factions within Ionia. Why can&rsquo;t you just be one great big and all powerful island. You certainly could be very strong and a very dangerous threat to Noxus, Demacia and Freljord,&rdquo; the Noxian replied.\n\n&ldquo;Why are you telling this to your enemy?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been the one to think of the political effects of my speech. I&rsquo;m just an assassin, I follow orders and do my job.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Was it your orders to chase me?&rdquo;\n\nThe Noxian paused to think about what her mission was again.\n\n&ldquo;My mission was to exterminate anything that would get in the way of our main forces. You stand in the way of the Noxian military, so I will have to get rid of you.&rdquo;\n\nThe Noxian pulled out her blades and fell back into a fighting stance.\n\n&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; the Ionian said as a blue ball of magic manifested, floating above her right hand. Katarina and Ahri charged at each other and thus began the first duel of the Noxian invasion of Ionia.\n\n{{champion:103}} {{champion:55}} \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nSyndra {{champion:134}}  and Zed {{champion:238}} approached the Ionian council building warily. While Karma {{champion:43}}  herself had summoned them to the council personally, the only reason they went was because Karma {{champion:43}} said it threatened all of Ionia and Ionian culture. Just in case that this &ldquo;summit&rdquo; was a trap, Zed had stationed shadows of Syndra and himself so that they could jump out safely and quickly. They entered the building and an attendant guided them underground, into a room with two gigantic and heavy looking doors **(Author&rsquo;s note: the doors are made of a similar metal as Braum&rsquo;s{{champion:201}}  door (his shield)). **There was a large, circular official table, with the Ionian flag in the center. Karma was on the opposite side of the table in relation to the door. On her left was Shen{{champion:98}} , Akali {{champion:84}} was next to him. On the right of her was Yone, Yasuo{{champion:157}} , Taliyah {{champion:163}} and Master Yi{{champion:11}}. Zed knew of all of these people (due to his travels around Ionia), with the exception of Taliyah. Syndra on the other hand, had heard of these people, but did not know what they looked like. She was surprised to see how differently they dressed in comparison to her normal attire. There were nine seats left. Zed sat next to Master Yi (Shen and Akali tend to make Zed uncomfortable and vice-versa) and Syndra sat next to Zed, exactly opposite of Karma.\n\n&ldquo;Waiting on seven people,&rdquo; Karma said. A she said that, Lee Sin{{champion:64}} , Udyr{{champion:77}} and Varus{{champion:110}}  **(Author&rsquo;s Note: Before Varus was &ldquo;corrupted,&rdquo; he was a guardian of Ionia. The skin Arclight Varus is based off of this time)** walked in.\n\n&ldquo;Four,&rdquo; she corrected. They sat waiting. Shen and Akali were talking. Varus was talking to Karma, Yasuo to Taliyah and Yone, Master Yi seemed to be meditating.\n\n&ldquo;Do you have any idea of what we&rsquo;re doing here?&rdquo; Syndra asked Zed. Said ninja turned and looked her in the eye.\n\n&ldquo;Yesterday, one of the shadows I have on the outskirts of the island was disturbed. When I sent five of my students to investigate, only one returned, and he said that they were struck down by someone moving faster than them, whom struck from the darkness. I theorise we are looking at a possible invasion, or another situation like Khada Jhin{{champion:202}},&rdquo; Zed said, his voice sounding unusually disturbed. The doors opened once more. In walked Irelia{{champion:39}} , whom was standing behind a girl in silver armour. She had blonde hair and blue stockings{{champion:99}}. She was also holding a wand or staff of sorts. Judging from nationality, they theorised that this was a Demacian. Before the doors closed, another person walked in. Wearing a white poncho and his mask, Jhin{{champion:202}} was certainly given a few strange looks. Zed glared, Shen seemed surprisingly neutral. Jhin looked at Zed and said, &ldquo;Oh stop, haven&rsquo;t you gotten over yourself already? You&#039;re still just the child that wanted me dead years ten years ago.&rdquo;\n\nZed looked away, still pissed off.\n\n&ldquo;One,&rdquo; Karma said. They were starting to get impatient when the doors opened for the final time. Ahri{{champion:103}} walked in, covered in blood and sweat. Her clothes were torn and her tails were dyed red at the tips with blood.\n\n&ldquo;What happened to you?&rdquo; Yasuo asked.\n\n&ldquo;A Noxian scouting group just so happened to be in my way. Their leader was an assassin whom gave me a run for my money,&rdquo; she replied.\n\n&ldquo;Did you kill her?&rdquo; Karma asked.\n&ldquo;She ran off before I could get the killing blow in.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;So we&rsquo;re looking at an invasion,&rdquo; Zed said, his hand stroking his mask&rsquo;s chin.\n\n&ldquo;That _is_ the reason I summoned you all here. I know some of us are enemies,&rdquo; Karma said, looking around. At this point she looked at Syndra, who glared back, before Karma continued, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll have to fight together because this threatens all of Ionia. Because we are facing Noxians, I requested information from Demacia, hence why Lux is here.&rdquo;\n\nSaid girl stood up and nodded. She began by talking about the Noxian leaders and fighters, &ldquo;Noxians are basically bred for war. All of their leaders value the strength of their soldiers over values. Jericho Swain{{champion:50}} is Noxus&rsquo; current leader. Katarina Du Couteau{{champion:55}} is one of their best scouts and assassins. She has red hair, two blades and generally dresses in black. Does this match the assassin you fought, Ahri?&rdquo;\n\nAhri nodded. It was an exact description. Lux continued on, &ldquo;The two war machines they have are Darius{{champion:122}} and Sion{{champion:14}}. Sion will probably lead the forces into battle. He is gigantic and wields an axe. Darius is similar, although significantly shorter, but still taller than most here. If you take down Sion and Darius, the Noxian forces will lose their morale.&rdquo;\n\nThe Ionians took this information into account. It sounded like Darius and Sion were the war horses of Noxus. Zed asked,\n&ldquo;Are there any other assassins that are to be noted, and any other dangerous targets?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Talon Du Couteau{{champion:91}} is the only other notable assassin. He&rsquo;s usually hooded and has the ability to &lsquo;blink&rsquo; behind people. There is also an assassin that goes by the name &lsquo;LeBlanc{{champion:7}},&rsquo; but we know very little of her due to the fact that she doesn&rsquo;t often show up on the battlefield, as she works for a organisation called &ldquo;The Black Rose&rdquo;. As for other member whom are dangerous, Vladimir{{champion:8}} is one of the higher ranking generals in Noxus, although be wary around him for he is a hemomancer.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Hemomancer?&rdquo; Udyr asked.\n\n&ldquo;A person who uses blood, whether it&rsquo;s theirs or not, for their magical use,&rdquo; Varus explained.\n\nAs he finished saying that, what felt like an earthquake struck. Once it stopped not three seconds after, Ahri, Zed, Shen and Udyr rushed outside to check on what had happened. The rest quickly followed after them. What they found was that the village and the above ground of the council hall had been obliterated. Ahri was glaring at Katarina, who was on the other side of the leveled village, standing in front of the noxian forces. Zed immediately shadowed to his dojo and alerted his students, whom were ready for this. He shadowed back to the battle ground, shortly after his students appeared behind him. Shen teleported to the Kinjou temple, and then teleported the members back to the soon to be battlefield. The Ionian military soon arrived, having noticed the smoke from afar. Yasuo, Taliyah and Yone made their way to their village, as they noticed smoke coming from that direction. Master Yi&rsquo;s village was north of the battleground, so he made his way there to gather warriors for the battle. Shojin Monastery monks began showing up, standing with Lee Sin and Udyr. Master Yi arrived soon after, followed by many men and women ready to fight. Ahri took to the trees to strike down from the shadows.\n\n_&ldquo;Lath Rian Oune Vi Phyla!&rdquo;_ Karma chanted as she prepared her Mantra.** (Author&rsquo;s Note: what she chants is an Ionian dialect. It translated to _Weave the Threads of Tranquility!_ in English).**\n\nThe Noxian and Ionian forces looked each other down. Katarina saw Lux behind Karma and scowled. Sion came out of the forest and stood next to Katarina. His body seemed to dwarf the human. The Ionians were slightly intimidated by his size, but regained their composure quickly, for they had fought much bigger creatures. SIon made the first move, and charged at the Ionians, who charged back.\n\nThus was the start of war.","replies":[]}
