If I play a norms game/ARAM by myself I always end up with 3 new people in a lobby before the evening is over. It's as easy as spamming the \"thumbs up emote\" every time a player shows consideration for another (eg, using their heal for you, or letting you step on the healing pad for bonus hp in ARAM, delivering a solid gank in your lane or a free kill for you, a free buff etc). If I felt there was solid communication/positive playstyle from them I'll add them after the game.\n\n_ It can be as simple as finding that perfect adc/lane partner you just \"sync\" with_ even if there was no verbal/or emote communication at all. **The key is to invite them to discord** after the game to make things a memorable evening of playing, and soon enough you'll have the quite the large friends list. I've ended up with at least 10 solid regular discord friends for daily games, and about 30 that I play with weekly. (Ranging from Bronze 5 to literally Challenger and Master tier) It's the most satisfying thing in the world when you end up mutually owning other games to enjoy playing with them too!\n\nIn regards to your toxicity, we've all been there. If the \"gj\" and \"ty for gank\" in chat doesn't work for you, or dropping the thumbs up emote, sometimes I just drop my discord in champ select. People join in about 1/10 times I drop it, but when they do, **only the nice players join!** It's a social expectation that  _you're not going to flame them_ if you're inviting them to your personal space.\n\nIf you want people to remember you, you don't even have to carry the game. Something as simple as a free blue/red buff for them works too. The penta-kill team mate (if you are lucky to have one of those) _will certainly remember the person who** enabled** it._\n\nAnyway, be pro-active with those friend invites, and** play with them immediately** after adding them. \n\n**Good luck with making some friends dude!** \n_(You can add me if you like, I'm an unranked supp main)_","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-07-23T00:26:19.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, i find my friends just by having a laugh in games.\n\nabout 3-4 days ago i was playing with my premade friend and we stumbled into a game filled with trolls (not the bad kind) no one picked a proper champ for their role, i think it was a yi top, poppy mid, irelia jg (or something similar) and we essentially just fucked around for 30 minutes. the chat went from sexual innuendos and jokes into talking about the bs that is politics, i think at some point we even gave relationship advice, towards the end of the game we all added each other and discorded, i wouldn't say we play frequently (differing time tables) but we still chat our discord is somewhat lively, and filled with memes.\n\nif you just run into a fun loving bunch of nerds in norms/aram, queue up with them if you like them, after one toxic statement, you just leave and never speak again, its pretty simple","replies":[]},{"poster":"M1m1","date":"2018-07-22T11:48:29.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't play Ranked (because idk why I should as I keep meeting toxic people) and I'm like sorta new to the League game but I've had my friend help me not play like a Bronze player for starters and played for a few months now and yeah he doesn't want to play league anymore because of toxicity by teams and people we meet.

Of course there are a few times where I have been added and invited to the premade and the discord, but it is usually just for that session and not much else. \n\nThe best way to make friends in league (or at least what I have found) is to get involved with the general community a bit more. Places like [Summoners Society](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SummonersSocietyOCE/) are a good place to start, and there are a [few large discord servers](https://discord.gg/BCGcgcF) as well. Uni and high school clubs are also pretty great in this regard (if this is an option for you).","replies":[]}]}
