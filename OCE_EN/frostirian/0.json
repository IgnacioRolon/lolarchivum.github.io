Do the summoners have no shame or was this a cruel joke? To work alongside an abomination like this, a cruel ethereal being, an emblazoned puppet-master, sickened Caitlyn to her core. She had little choice in the matter however, as they set up an ambush against the Freljordian duo, Ashe the frost archer and, her faithful and steadfast companion Braum.\r\n\r\n A wave of minions clashed against one another, fighting to the death, Tiny blades against shield and flesh, a slew of spells coming from their rear-mounted comrades. Naught but cannon fodder, Caitlyn reflected sadly. &quot;Look, here they come, like lambs to the slaughter!&quot; uttered Brand a rye smile on his face, the smell of brimstone thick in Caitlyn&#039;s nostrils as he spoke. She placed a trap on the very edge of the bush, it&#039;s springs creaking under the enormous load.\r\n\r\nCaitlyn lines up a shot on Ashe, pulling up from her crouched position to ride the shot. With a thunderous roar, the shot speeds across the clearing, catching Ashe on her on the thigh, a rivulet of crimson pouring from her wound. &quot;Braum, we&#039;re under attack!&quot; Ashe barked, pain showing on her face. Braum turned his mighty mass toward the brush, anger seething on his face, raising his shield he slams forward the sheet of ice covering his shield. Caitlyn fires her net in return, recoiled forcefully back by the great hempen mass. \r\n\r\nBrand however is not so lucky, a thick spray of icy shards crash into him. The ice screams as it punctures his molten flesh, dazed he desperately raises a pillar of flame to bar their path. Braum does not yield however, engulfed in flame he slams a meaty fist into Brand&#039;s face, magic cascading off, unable to follow it&#039;s mortal shell. Ashe unleashes a torrent of frigid arrows, each bringing Brand closer to an icy prison. Brand unleashes a ball of flame toward Ashe to bring temporary respite to his frozen hell, only to be halted on a ghostly shield raised before Braum, a grin spreading across his mustached face.\r\n\r\nAll the meanwhile Caitlyn lays down fire, trying bring down her frosty foes. A leg, an arm, a head, how do they still stand? Her trap snaps shut as Braum takes a step too far, a grimace replaces the smile that was once there. Brand takes another shot, his frame freezes accompanied by an angry crackling, surely he can&#039;t remain frozen for long. Caitlyn loads a peacemaker into her barrel, a scythed contraption for criminals that she could not detain. With a metallic screech it fly&#039;s from her gun, sailing past brand, it slices through Braum and Ashe, a ribbon of blood trailing behind.\r\n\r\nBrand breaks free from his bonds, slamming his hand together with all his might. A tremendous ball of flame rushes forward towards Braum. Panicked he slams his shield into the ground, a mighty glacier fissure bursts forth killing Brand, his corrupted essence rockets upward arcing towards the nexus from which he was summoned. His pyroclasm however continues on slamming into Braum turning him to charcoal and spilling on towards the minions behind.\r\n\r\nAshe near mortally wounded, sprays a volley of arrows and dashes for the safety of the tower. Caitlyn clears her mind, takes her stance and raises her rifle. A slow smile spreading across her face.\r\n\r\n[Any feedback is appreciated by the way :) ]","replies":[{"poster":"Waysted1","date":"2016-06-28T23:59:51.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i love the last two sentences, it gives enough to entice without giving all away, we dont know if ashe dies, its likely that she did but its open none the less for her escape. a great piece of narrative. kudos","replies":[]}]}
