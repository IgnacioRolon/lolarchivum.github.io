Does it offer any synergy within her kit, generally on hit effects?\n\nThe truth is while Diana may gain additional magic damage every 3rd auto attack, she actually doesn't usually sit around to repeatedly spam that.  She's not like Jax that can deal high sustained damage but rather insane burst damage. Furthermore Devourer not only delays your power spike but puts you at greater risk of being counter jungled due to you lacking burst that you would have with Runic Echoes. ","replies":[]}]}
