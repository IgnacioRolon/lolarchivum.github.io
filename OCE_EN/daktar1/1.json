For starters, the Heal scales with the damage dealt when critting so no IE = lower crit damage = lower heal. Then you need to take into account whether you actually need the healing in the comp you're in/with the comp you're against or whether you'd be better off with the damage from Fervor.\n\nFor the most part, AD Carries should be getting Fervor of Battle with Thunderlord's and Warlord's tied for a close second.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-15T00:23:13.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on the ADC. Most take Fervor, some take Warlord's, a few take Thunderlord's. I'd do it somewhat like this. Some ADCs can utilise more than one keystone pretty effectively so it'd be personal preference on what you take. It's typically just on burst you take Thunderlord's, on late carries you take Warlord's and for the others you take Fervor.\n\nWarlord's: Jinx, Tristana, Caitlyn, Twitch, Draven, Vayne, MF, \nFervor: Lucian, Twitch, Caitlyn, Ashe, Sivir, Vayne, Varus, Quinn, Kalista, Kog'Maw\nThunderlord's: Graves, Corki, Ezreal, MF, Vayne","replies":[]}]}
