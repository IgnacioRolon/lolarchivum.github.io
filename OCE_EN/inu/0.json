I think the closest you are going to get to an accurate player rank is by using another game and then judging a players ability based on time played in each game.\n\nSo I made masters in sc2 in under a year and I am diamond in rocket league right now. I have played League of legends at least 5 times more than both those games.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperiusˆ","date":"2017-04-06T01:59:26.160+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"doesnt mean youre high elo at league as you are in the two other games. your attitude is legit disgusting, and you should never be allowed to play for a competitive team with that mindset. you're a hardstuck gold player who can only play twitch, an extremely small champion pool for a player that has a strong desire to go pro. maybe if you came to the conclusion that you're a shit player who requires immense amounts of improvement for having 500 games in season 7 and still be gold after 4 seasons, you would be suited to playing in a competitive environment. try expanding your champ pool outside of twitch for once, play to the meta like every other competitive player does and fix that shitty ''but im a good player at rocket league and starcraft, and riot does not make a good solo performance indicator'' mindset or fuck off. on behalf of several other high elo players who think you are also a joke","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2017-04-06T13:04:27.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"It is funny because I know I excel at this game. I do not however excel at sc2 or rocket league relatively, and you know, 5 times the playtime etc.\n\nAlso being high elo doesnt mean you are good at league either. So I guess no one is good at league!\n\nThe reason I play twitch 24/7 is because he is the strongest adc in the game by a long shot, I have every champion and I can play them pretty damn well, not because of my mechanics, but because of my game knowledge.\n\nI am the one who keeps taking the bait of trying to use logic in a situation where people have blind faith in the riot religion. I can't help but to keep giving people chances that they might come to their senses, that maybe I just have to word it in a particular way to trigger something in people's brains to think \"what if he is ACTUALLY right? Maybe he has been right all this time and I have just been brainwashed into thinking the way I do. Maybe I should look into his data with a clean unbiased mindset and even give him a chance to prove himself.\"\n\nCan't blame me for trying to provide a fresh perspective for people in case they overlooked something. I don't know about anyone else but I actually did the research and have tried to prove myself wrong on top of it. No one else has proven me wrong and I can't seem to prove myself wrong.\n\nI know this is probably futile, but it is how I like to spend my time.","replies":[{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2017-04-08T22:52:04.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We went over this man, your not Hot Sh*T don't get roosted and then run to other boards to get roosted.... -_-","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2017-04-09T13:28:53.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look, if people are not going to use logic, then why should I?","replies":[{"poster":"Scøtt","date":"2017-04-23T07:59:19.898+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just give up dude","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"inu","date":"2017-04-06T02:54:18.106+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Imperiuš,realm=OCE,application-id=mR0UmRrp,discussion-id=aRUNzOA6,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-04-06T01:59:26.160+0000)\n>\n> doesnt mean youre high elo at league as you are in the two other games. your attitude is legit disgusting, and you should never be allowed to play for a competitive team with that mindset. you&#x27;re a hardstuck gold player who can only play twitch, an extremely small champion pool for a player that has a strong desire to go pro. maybe if you came to the conclusion that you&#x27;re a shit player who requires immense amounts of improvement for having 500 games in season 7 and still be gold after 4 seasons, you would be suited to playing in a competitive environment. try expanding your champ pool outside of twitch for once, play to the meta like every other competitive player does and fix that shitty &#x27;&#x27;but im a good player at rocket league and starcraft, and riot does not make a good solo performance indicator&#x27;&#x27; mindset or fuck off. on behalf of several other high elo players who think you are also a joke\n\nomg preach it","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-04-06T03:29:00.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He took the bait.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Minigorophin","date":"2017-04-05T17:19:28.219+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"upvote, nice guy!","replies":[]}]}
