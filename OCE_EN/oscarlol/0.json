This is ridiculous.","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I received the following e-mail from Leagueoflegends@email.riotgames.com:\n_Hello Summoner,_\n\n_Your account: osc833 was banned due to the use of malicious 3rd party programs or modifications to your League of Legends client. We believe that all players should play on equal footing in an effort to promote competitive sportsmanship. You should be aware that modifying your League of Legends client is against the Terms of Use: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse. We hope you can see that it is unsatisfying to play against other players who are using a tool to gain an advantage over others._\n\n_If you wish to dispute the actions taken against your account, you may contact us via this link:_\n\n_http://support.riotgames.com_\n------\n\nWhat in the hell is going on Riot, I spent almost two weeks of patience and correspondence to recover my account and now you&#039;ve banned my account when I haven&#039;t even had the time to play the game? This is absolutely unacceptable. I was extremely patient in working with your accounts team to get my account back, change my e-mail address and even change BOTH my e-mail address associated and my account password to completely unique never before used passwords - let alone in combination with my e-mail. **The e-mail itself is new and is secured by two-way authentication.** How in the HELL are things still happening on my account when i&#039;m not even touching it ?\n\nI started work full time in the country the week after I recovered my account and have had zero time for LoL , and now on the ONE long weekend I have free to try and pick the game up again this BS happens? This makes absolutely no sense - i&#039;ve had my account since before Season 1 of LoL and never had even a report against me til I was hacked. I haven&#039;t even played a match since recovering this account.\n\nEven with all of my e-mail and passwords secure there is so much wrong with what is happening. I need a please explain , this is completely unacceptable.\n\nI have gone through absolute hell just to recover and secure my account, the e-mail associated is completely unknown to anyone else I know, I have no brothers, no sisters, i live by myself. I do not give passwords out to anyone. My Windows install is fresh. What the hell more do I have to do to stop things happening to my account? \n\nHere was my last correspondence with your team regarding securing my account - I suggest you check with person as to my authenticity. The only thing I can think of is that the people who hacked my account were also using cheats or exploits at the same time. \n\n-----------------\n_Jamdaze _\n\n_Jamdaze (Riot Games Player Support)_\n\n_Jan 24, 05:13_\n\n_Hello there Summoner,_\n\n_Iâ€™m Jamdaze, ready to help purge your problems!_\n\n_Thank you so much for the vital information you sent. After checking around every dark corner, I think we are safe and ready to attack this issue head-on. Evil lurks around every corner; so please let me guide you through the closure of the case:_\n\n_I already reversed the Summoner name change as well as the other transactions made._\n\n_For now, I would love to know that you are doing your best to protect your account. Just to be sure, I would like to share my means of protecting my account. To do so, I always change my password and never share it with anyone else. Also, if you are using an email that you rarely use, change the email linked to your account with the one you use often._\n\n_I guess this is it for me. I hope I lessened your worries and if there is ever anything else we can help you with, you are very welcome to send us a message!_\n","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-13T07:37:08.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nDo you currently have a ticket open with Player Support regarding this ban?
