I haven't even played!","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Let me tell you my story.**\n\n**Jan 20 2016**\nMy account had been inactive and unused for a year. Whilst I have not been proactive on the game, I have always valued my LoL account as I spent quite a bit of money and time into both my collection of champions and skins for this account. It was something that I wasn&#039;t proactively using, but definitely wanted to come back to when my work life was less busy.\n\nAs soon as I saw a ban come through on my e-mail address for a username I did not recognise I took great steps to recover, identify myself and give assurances that my account was secured. I explained to the GM team patiently that my account had been inactive for some time, and that the user ID and purchases made on my account were definitely not made by me.\n\n**Jan 27 2016**\nMy account was recovered, and GM Jamdaze was very helpful in assisting me with this. I assured him I had taken great lengths to both secure my account and e-mail address with unique complex passwords, as well as securing my e-mail account with two way authentication so that I was virtually hack proof. I installed and updated my LoL client and kept it up to date however, I did not play a single match on this account after recovering.\n\nA few days after this was secured,I received a job offer to work in the country which I accepted, which left me little time for LoL, feeling comfortable in the fact my account was secure and nothing could ever possibly happen to it, I left my account Idle again , and begun my new career path in the country.\n\n**March 11 2016**\nI checked my new e-mail account and received what seemed to be an automated response from Riot&#039;s e-mail system given that I hadn&#039;t played a match. However, much to my shock and horror it appeared I had actually been banned despite not playing a single match on my account since recovery.\n\n_Hello Summoner,\n\nYour account: xxxxxx was banned due to the use of malicious 3rd party programs or modifications to your League of Legends client. We believe that all players should play on equal footing in an effort to promote competitive sportsmanship. You should be aware that modifying your League of Legends client is against the Terms of Use: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse. We hope you can see that it is unsatisfying to play against other players who are using a tool to gain an advantage over others.\n\nIf you wish to dispute the actions taken against your account, you may contact us via this link:\n\nhttp://support.riotgames.com _\n\n**As you can imagine, this left me shocked but I figured it would be easily resolvable explaining what had previously happened on my account - I posted on the boards about this and I received a response from a GM:**\n\n_SephirothSG (OCE)\n - 5 days ago\nHey there,\nDo you currently have a ticket open with Player Support regarding this ban? If not I suggest you to open one as they&#039;re the only people who can help with account related issues.\nIf your account was recently compromised it&#039;s possible the person who compromised your account used the disallowed third party tools you were banned for._\n\n**March 15 2016**\nI lodged a ticket with the GM team through the account recovery page as instructed, feeling confident this was a simple misunderstanding I explained very carefully what had previously happened with my account and that this had to be a simple misunderstanding.\n\n**March 18 2016**\nHere I am today in total shock that this is even possible. I have not only been ignored but received a generic response from your GM. \n\n_OrochiKyo \t\nOrochiKyo (Riot Games Player Support)\nMar 15, 14:09\nHello oscarlol,\nYour account has been permanently suspended following the use of scripts, hacks, exploits or unauthorized third-party programs in League of Legends. Accounts that are caught using hacks to gain an unfair competitive advantage are subject to permanent suspension. We work hard to preserve a fair and competitive environment in League of Legends. Regardless of intent, use of unauthorized third-party programs is explicitly against the Terms of Use, which can be found here:\nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/legal/termsofuse\nKeep in mind that account sharing of any kind is also against the Terms of Use. You are responsible for all activity on your account, so be sure to keep your account information to yourself.\nWe won&#039;t be able to go into the specifics of an account&#039;s exploit abuse, as divulging this information could compromise future investigations. Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.\nOrochiKyo\nRiot Player Support\nThe Deathsinger_\n\n**Despite giving you as much information as possible your GM gives me a cut and pasted response. I have provided you with  all the necessary history to make the correct decision on this matter. In summary, if you lose access to your account once, be prepared for the ripple effects that may happen. Even if you have done your best to protect yourself afterwards. This account recovery process and the GM team have completely let me down. After six years playing this game, hundreds of dollars invested of both time and joy, I no longer feel like I can trust this organisation to fairly uphold what is right and wrong in this game. I have not had a game played on my account since January and that was in use by hackers, but yet I am still banned for actions that were not carried out by me, with no help and no one willing to listen. I hope you all can learn from this, even if you recover your account - be prepared for the ripple effects that a large organisation&#039;s blanket policies can issue on you with no reason or explanation. And most of all, no foot to stand on to defend yourself.**","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-03-18T10:44:30.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could I get your ticket number so we can look into it for you please :)","replies":[{"poster":"oscarlol","date":"2016-03-18T14:06:57.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"20868365 is the current one active to remove my ban.\n\n20090269 - was the one I first logged to restore my hacked account (which Jamdaze attended).\n\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"13AndAborted","date":"2016-08-28T20:09:57.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to necro this thread, but did you ever get your account back?","replies":[{"poster":"oscarlol","date":"2017-07-25T14:14:18.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like I didn't.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HallowHorror1031","date":"2016-04-09T18:25:58.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something similar happend to my friends account Im not so sure I need to invest a single dime into riot after what they did to him lol.riot kinda sucks","replies":[]}]}
