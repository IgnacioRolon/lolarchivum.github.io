(something like 2/7) blamed my jungler who was ivern for not ganking his lane before olaf was 6. called himself high elo but he lost to a silver 1 olaf. he claimed he was high elo and we were all trash in game a few times. he went afk occasionally and danced around. i must admit i did tell him to killhimself 3/4 of the way he was doing so in game in which i take full repsonsibility and i say sorry. but the fact that riot arent doing much about getting rid of these people is the thing that really annoys me. i get these kind of people probably around 60% of the time and its just ridiculous. riot pull your pants up. these toxic people make others toxic. its like a disease. get your act together if u really care us.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2016-12-21T10:20:26.809+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was just a bad game imo, it didn't feel like he was really in the \"toxic\" zone but more to do with being \"obnoxious\". The former is report-able, the latter depends. This guy seems to be walking on the line so Idk.\n\nHowever, telling others to kill themselves isn't right either. Remember, 2 wrongs don't make 1 right.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chong Wai","date":"2016-12-21T10:15:37.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"plz comment if u agree with me","replies":[]}]}
