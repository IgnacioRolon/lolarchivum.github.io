So I do not understand why the game won&#039;t end with a surrender.\nWhy does the game continue on when 3 people surrendered to it??? \n\n(It's a waste of time continuing the game, what's the point in the surrender vote system if the game is gonna continue at 3/2 votes.)\n\nChange the surrender vote so that the game will end even if it is 3/2 as **3 > 2**.\n\nI don&#039;t see why or how 2 should be equal to 3. You won&#039;t except 2 riot points if it&#039;s worth 3 would you?","replies":[{"poster":"Flood","date":"2015-06-11T17:53:29.782+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woah we've got a mathematician here! I've also come across similar threads before, by that I mean by the dozen.\n\nWhy it shouldn't be 3 to 2 is purely due to the fact that the 2 that voted no can potentially carry the game. Even though the numbers favour surrender it is only **one** more. It is so easy to have 3 - 2 vote in favour of surrender but harder to have all 4 team mates vote yes which is a system to keep you from losing hope. I feel like most of the people who post these kind of stuff are ones who give up the easiest. Don't lose hope because at late game team fights matters more than a petty unfavourable trade at 12 minutes into the game. If you look at Pro players at LCS or Worlds they don't give up because of an ace at dragon because they know there are future skirmishes and all out team fight that can quickly turn the game around. \n\nHere's a very bland way of putting it into perspective that I found in other forums:\n\"You think the Game is over so you start a Vote. Now the majority of the other 4 Players need to agree it is over and 2 out of 4 is not a majority...\"\nSounds like a horrible way of explaining it, but it works logically.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-12T00:03:32.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep.

Look at the statistics in gold leads instead. 12 more kills=3600 gold maximum due to depleting gold worth per consecutive death. 3600 gold is equivalent to a few jungle clears, a few turrets each worth 625 gold total and obvious farming will make up the difference in the late game. If you don't think you can come back from 4 - 16 then **YOU** are responsible for the loss of that game. If you think afking because it pointless then it's **YOU** who is causing people to tilt and if **YOU** cbf with playing then I ask: why bother playing at all with that attitude? \nMy advice from a fellow player to another is that don't give up way too easily. You can't predict the distance future with a present score, people get cocky all the time. Played against an overly-egotistical Fiora who was 18-4-5 at the time, but she starting throwing because she thought she could 1v5 with Lissandra and Nautilus in our team. She lost and we won because we did not prevail. We won also because we had 3 - 2 vote. Please change that attitude of yours, it will make the LoL community a whole lot better.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-06-12T03:04:25.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was going to vote this down, but kinda want people to see Floods response.","replies":[]}]}
