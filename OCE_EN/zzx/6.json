My friends and I are looking for players to jam with, we vary of all kinds of ranks and roles. We are very easy going and laid back, I’d suggest if you are looking for a real competitive squad to perhaps look at other posts,\n\nDiscord use would be preferred as were always up for talking a bit of shit and it’ll be easier to get to know you!\n\nOnly thing I’ll preface by saying is that we are very easy going.
