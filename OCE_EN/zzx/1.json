Pick and ban - compositions, what to pick, when and why\n2. Strategy - playing around power spikes, map movements, etc\n3. Team review -  What the team thinks (you guys) should discuss\n\n**How can this help us improve?**\n\nFirstly, from the perspectives of each individual player, you will hopefully learn things about the game that you didn&#039;t know before, e.g, understanding when to pick a champion and why, when you should look to fight based on the champions and other circumstances in the game and much more. But secondly and more importantly, in my own personal experience it can be helpful to have someone from the outside looking in for a more objective view of the game.\n\n**What the analysis will NOT include**\n\nThe analysis will not include suggestions or comments on mechanical errors made inside the game unless that is something that you would like. The reason for this is very simple, I do not claim to be some amazing mechanical genius and most of the time I won&#039;t be able to help you with those kinds of errors.\n\n**A little bit about me**\n\nI&#039;ve been playing League of Legends for 2-3 years, my highest reached Division is PLAT IV, kind of on the low end but I think that I have some knowledge about the game that players around that level don&#039;t have. I don&#039;t really follow the pro scene, especially not OPL, but I do occasionally watch the NALCS and LCK. The recent MonteCristo reviews have given me some insight on how I should approach looking at games, but as I said earlier, I&#039;m still very new to this. \n\nIf this sounds like something that you are interested in having or testing out for your team, let me know. I prefer to be contacted in game, though I will check here from time to time.\n\nThanks.\n\nIGN: Remembrance","replies":[{"poster":"Theta Floz","date":"2015-04-27T02:49:56.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey dude,\n\nMe and my team are interested in what you've got to offer bro.\n\nI've added you in game so feel free to shoot me a message when you can.\n\nCheers,\nFloz","replies":[]},{"poster":"zzx","date":"2015-04-17T04:15:37.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to clear things up, if it wasn't obvious already, this is completely free.","replies":[]}]}
