Gold2 promos and I get 2 mid silvers and unranked on my team?\r\n\r\nTired of how broken this matchmaking is, way too many games get blown out by 10 minutes with people getting 1v1 or 2v2'd over and over, yet somehow they're still in an elo that they don't belong. https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/submit\r\n\r\nPrimary reason: LP isn't affected by individual performance even though they have a metric for it in champion score.\r\n\r\nI had a game 2 nights ago:\r\nI went 41-1-13, 95% kill participation, I got 18LP\r\nMy ADC went 4-12, fed his lane like crazy, died instantly every fight did 40% of my damage and he got 20LP.\r\n\r\nI fail to see how that is remotely fair and it's stuff like that, where people feed and still get good LP despite being carried, that keeps this broken system going.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomo7182","date":"2019-05-26T00:38:30.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Pantheon is the only silver player in that game. he was duo with the lux so thats why he is in that game.\n2. the yorick is gold, the site you use lied to you\n3. the silver did the best in that game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Taliyah","date":"2019-05-22T04:21:41.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so two things:\n\n1. If you have silvers on your team, they must be good silvers. They are winning enough for riot to place them with golds. (i.e. their MMR is high)\n\n2. If you're going really good in a game (95% k/p etc), its probably because you're vsing people who are... less good than you. For that reason, it doesnt make sense to reward you with a bunch of lp for beating lesser players.\n\nhope this makes sense","replies":[]}]}
