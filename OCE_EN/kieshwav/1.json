Gold2 promos and I get 2 mid silvers and unranked on my team?\nhttps://imgur.com/a/aJpTExz\n\nTired of how broken this matchmaking is, way too many games get blown out by 10 minutes with people getting 1v1 or 2v2'd over and over, yet somehow they're still in an elo that they don't belong. \n\n\nPrimary reason: LP isn't affected by individual performance even though they have a metric for it in champion score.\n\nI had a game 2 nights ago:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/PZNk4yn\nI went 41-1-13, 95% kill participation, I got 18LP\nMy ADC went 4-12, fed his lane like crazy, died instantly every fight did 40% of my damage and he got 20LP.\n\nI fail to see how that is remotely fair and it's stuff like that, where people feed and still get good LP despite being carried, that keeps this broken system going.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2019-05-21T23:30:06.380+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The first image that you posted is so familiar to me. It usually happens to me, **_just after_** a promos series that I've won. Just for arguments sake, here is a recent case in point:\n\n[Stupid matchmaking](https://i.imgur.com/tQh6Tvq.jpg)\n\nThis is the number one thing that I would like to be fixed in ranked. The games like this are a waste of time, some clown fiesta stomp for one team and not a display of equally skilled players. Waste of time for both teams involved.\n\nAnd yes, there will be those that say that the teams are even in mmr, blah blah blah, but actually is that true? Why should accounts that haven't played in a long time retain their mmr? NEACE has a good suggestion, [here.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D6ift1vXoAcYrC4.png)\n\nIn my situation above, there is no way the teams are evenly matched, unless Sivir had very high mmr. Now they played like the worst player on the team, and last year they were silver ranked. So i refuse to believe that. Then some might say, well the gold player opposition have bad mmr. And that's not possible either when you look at their win rates.\n\nThen the other question is: **HOW THE HELL DOES A BRONZE PLAYER GET IN A GAME WITH HIGH SILVERS AND GOLDS?** \n\nOh, that's easy you say, they were duo with someone. And that's why you had harder opposition overall. \n\nGood try, but there were no duos on our team. I checked.\n\nFix your matchmaking Riot, it's been crap for a long time now. Whether you include a button in the client to say to player \"I will wait LONGER FOR ACCURATE MATCHMAKING\" or just take NEACE's ideas, it needs to be fixed.","replies":[]}]}
