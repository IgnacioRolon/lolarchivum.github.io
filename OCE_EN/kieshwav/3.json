It would be nice to see something along the lines of \"you're behaving poorly, sliding down the honour scale, punishment is coming\"\r\n\r\nI know they always talk of \"if people see progress, then they game the system\" but I think that's a poor excuse, instant and relative feedback could be more useful.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-29T13:39:25.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is linked. Any punishment will result in a drop in Honour tier. Down to Honour 1 for a chat restriction, down to Honour 0 for bans (and chat restrictions received at Honour 1).\n\nRealistically, that first chat restriction *is* the warning that behaviour is sliding, which is why the Honour drop doesn't happen until an actual punishment is triggered.\n\nIn addition to that, negativity in games that isn't enough to trigger a punishment will still prevent you from earning Honour for that game, so the visible progress is that there is no progress. \n\nIf it's one off game you likely won't notice, but if it's a consistent thing you will start falling behind the average and positive players quite quickly.","replies":[]}]}
