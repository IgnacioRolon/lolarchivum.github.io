Stop playing Lux. You suck at Lux. Your cs on her is awful.

Upgrade your trinket. its free at lvl 9. just do it.\n\n3. play more and play often. the only way to get better is to play more and learn from mistakes. Stop thinking your only in Bronze because of teammates and \"you do well against higher ranked people\".\n\n4. Play more! Your account has almost no ranked games over 3 years.

Ask yourself, \"Why do we bother to cs?\" and when you truly understand this question, then you will have your answer to the above question :)\n\n> The thing is I try not to get tilted about teammates and just play the game, but it is hard to carry every game  when people don't listen to simple instructions.

When it comes to playing worse, \"worse\" can just mean \"worse\" in one area only.\n\n> Sorry if I'm whinging but the game is just much more enjoyable playing with better players.\n\nAgreed. When you get to Diamond 2+, that's when the real game begins. Until then you will have to carry the trash on your back, sorry about that :)","replies":[{"poster":"Joiksu","date":"2018-02-22T00:15:41.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Here is an example of \"carrying trash\"](https://imgur.com/a/7LCmx). In this game it was a Co-op vs AI (Intermediate bots) game. However, all 4 of my teammates were cheating by using robots to level their accounts in this. I.E. they don't care if they win or lose, they just farm XP, so that the owner of the account can then sell it.\nSo they are feeding like crazy. But still got carried.\nIf you can go into a custom game and put yourself on a team of 4 bots (beginner) + yourself v 5 bots (intermediate) and win, then you are closer to learning how to carry. After that reduce the number of bots on your team until there is only yourself left. It's good training.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-02-21T09:14:01.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BarryButcher,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=jNGimeBb,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2018-02-21T08:26:25.524+0000)\n>My rough rule is, you can tell where someone deserves to be after 50 ranked games and they usually are where they belong after 100.\n\nAlthough a good rule of thumb, not a hard and fast rule. I think everyone has an upper limit that they will never pass. But I think many people are stuck well below their upper limit because they just dont know the game.\n\nI dont reckon I'll ever get gold because I am not good enough in a 1v1 against a gold opponent - just dont have the micro skills. But I can lose lane and carry game in silver because I can make up for a lack of micro skills with some learned macro - I dont tilt too easily, I ward a bit, I pay attention to build order and itemisation, and I keep an eye on minimap. These are techniques that can be learned to maximise natural potential. \n\nSo while he (assuming he because of the 'Kon' in konquest) might be stuck after 100 games, if he starts warding more in game 101 he'll start to climb. If he tilts less from game 110 on he'll climb. if he chooses the best build order to maximise impact on the game from game 120, he'll climb. If he doesnt push out and wards and keeps an eye on minimap, he'll climb.\n\nEveryone has a potential to be reached and a ceiling they'll never pass. But learning the game allows you to get to that ceiling. Bronze is a low ceiling - if I can get out, anyone can.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Joiksu","date":"2018-02-21T03:40:16.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=konquest236,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=jNGimeBb,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-02-21T02:27:42.245+0000)\n>\n> I'm stuck in Bronze and I'm not sure why?\n\nBecause you've only played 11 games of ranked soloqueue. If you want to prove yourself, you need a much larger sample size. \n\n> Some games slipped away during the placement games, but I still dominated for the most part and was expecting to start climbing from silver.\n\nDominating means nothing, only winning. I would set your sights on improving at the game and not worrying about your rank. When you improve, then results get better.\n\n> The level in Bronze is quite bad, I do well against players in higher ranks yet get put in Bronze? How does this MMR system work?\n\nYou'll have to earn the right to play players in higher ranks by overcoming bronze players firstly. If you can maintain a 50% win rate or better, you will eventually climb. But you'll need to grind out a lot of games.\n\n> Feel free to have a look at my match history and pick me apart I'm open to criticism.\n\nKeep playing twitch, and don't play mid lane until you know how your champion can cs, and also you know when and **when not** to roam.","replies":[{"poster":"konquest236","date":"2018-02-21T13:29:46.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply! \nReally informative!\n\nI do understand that I need to grind out a lot of games to achieve desired rank but I'm just curious to how this placement system works.

Duo-ing puts you at a deficit (your three teammates will be weaker than the corresponding enemies), unless you both are way better than the division you are playing in.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-02-21T07:05:26.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got out of bronze 2 to S4 in about 4 days.
