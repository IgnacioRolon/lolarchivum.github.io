I think its unfair that summoners in certain servers get recognized for bringing their friends to play this amazing game while some summoners dont. I think its about time to bring the Refer-A-Friend system to the OCE server .","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-02-08T22:47:58.170+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is something we are working on.

It reads as if you are pausing for a while between each word.\nAnyway though, yeah there have been a lot of these posts, and a lot of crappy responses on Riot's part. However, if we never said anything in the first place we wouldn't be putting that much pressure on Riot. Hell, if we never said anything about RAF they might have just decided to not do anything about it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Se7eN Peace","date":"2015-02-08T18:35:51.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There Have Been Loads of These...

However, making these posts of the forums increases the chances that Rioters will see that we want a bloody RAF system.","replies":[]}]}]}
