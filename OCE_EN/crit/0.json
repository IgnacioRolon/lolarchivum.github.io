I went for a level 4 dragon because the enemy team didn't have vision on it and their Lee was mid lane.\r\nANYWAY, I w'd it, making a clone, and after the clone went away the dragon wouldn't attack me...maybe it was the square i was standing in. \r\nI don't know HOW i did it, I just know that I did it. I haven't tried to do it again.\r\nI have a video i recorded which I sent to all my mates. If needed, I can upload or send this video somewhere.\r\n\r\nJust would like this patched as unfair bugs and glitches could give players the extra advantage over others, which isn't fair.\r\n\r\nCheers, \r\nI P In Pools","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-25T06:29:38.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"So i emailed player support and they told me to make a thread here....\"\n\nThey wouldn't tell you to put it on this board. Why go against something else they said? That completely removes their integrity. Head over to the [bug report boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report) for this.\n\nAlso the fact that you're unable to consistently repeat it does get rid of its believability, and possible solution.","replies":[{"poster":"Crit","date":"2015-02-25T11:19:10.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

If the glitch cannot be repeated then it cannot be resolved, as the conditions for which the glitch occurs in are unknown, thus making fixing it impossible.\n\nSorry if I was being a bit ambiguous with my previous statement. Everything I've said is still true, though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crit","date":"2015-02-25T11:20:12.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And also, they did tell me to post here.
