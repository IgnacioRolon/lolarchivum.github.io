I can still move and see health bars going down but cannot see the visuals of abilities cast, I cannot see gold when last hit a minion, and when something dies (minion, jungle camp, or champion) the health bar goes down but the body stays there. And when i hit blast clone my champion moves to the new location but I don&#039;t see the animation of me blasting over. \n\nI don&#039;t think this is simply lag because it happens every game and I always have around 60ms and 80 fps (I capped it thinking that would fix it). I&#039;ve tried pretty much everything in the resolution/graphics settings and full repair/re-install. \n\nThis has been going on for a couple months and I&#039;m not sure what is going on. Does anyone know what the problem is and how to fix it?\n\nThanks so much if you can!","replies":[{"poster":"NigTekz","date":"2017-12-25T22:34:24.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think i have this same problem, my game just stops working but my chat seems to be working fine, my ping is stable and so is my fps. it only started today for me","replies":[]}]}
