I&#039;ve been playing on NA the last two days, my latency is somewhat bearable, it&#039;s not great but it&#039;s still somewhat playable, I&#039;ve got a consistent 214 latency which I can work with, this is mainly so I can play some games with a friend of mine from NA, anyways, now that you know that here comes the weird shit.. I am from NZ and when I play on oce my latency is a stable 54-60, pretty much whats happened is since playing on NA and then coming back to oce, my latency on oce has shot up to a stable 327-328 MS.. pretty much unplayable, and here&#039;s the weird shit, I can log back onto NA and my latency is a stable 214 still, nothings changed about it, my connection to oce is no longer 54-60 MS it&#039;s changed completely to this and I don&#039;t know wtf has happened.\r\n\r\nTLDR: OCE stable MS is 54-60 is now 328 after playing on NA, NA latency has not changed which is 214 it&#039;s just my connection to OCE that has changed... solution?","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-27T11:17:24.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ayo! Can you try the solutions in the [**Troubleshooting Connection Issues**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) Riot Games Support article and let me know if anything works?
