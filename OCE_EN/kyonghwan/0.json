It severely restricts the user from making any claims or the ability to refute/appeal the matter to riot, I write this due to the fact that in the games mentioned below, I was provoked into the conversations and had equally toxic chat directed at myself from the user that I was conversing with.\n\nSecondly, I would like to know the basis of the claims, how they are judged and why no prior contact is made to the player informing them exactly about the reasons for the decision in order to allow the player to understand the processes that were involved in making this decision.\n\nFinally, the message also stated that &quot;other&quot; players judged my comms to be far below the standards of the league community. I would like to know why I have been targetted for this matter as I believe that it was unjust and that it has extremely impacted the way that I now view Riot. \n\nI would like to add that I have been a loyal player of League of Legends since its release date and from memory have been apart of the league community since Season 1. I have never recieved any chat restrictions bans or suspensions during this time. However, only recently have I been subjected to a chat restriction and believe that it was unjustly placed.\n\nI would very much appreciate any type of feedback and whether the restriction was placed due to a report made by an &#039;Individual&#039; player ;who would most likely show the chat in a negative light to the player who he was having conflict with, or if the games and chat logs are actively monitored by the league community (RIOT) and are judged objectively after viewing the chat of both players. If the prior is the case I would suggest that you take a more thorough approach to the investigations as it could severely impact the league experience of the player that has been subjected to such bans/restrictions.\n\nThank you for your time and I will be expecting a reply.\n\nKind Regards,\n\nKyong Hwan (Raphael) Kim\n\nP.S. I am currently unable to continue playing league due to the fact that when the notice arrived, there was no option to refute the claims or get in contact with any RIOT staff. Rather there was only the option of clicking \"I Understand\", which would clearly state that the player has agreed and accepted the restrictions; regardless of their view on the matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-27T13:28:28.422+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since Tele had to go to bed, I'll add in a few things he didn't address.\n\n> Firstly...\n\nUltimately it is your behaviour that had gotten you restricted. Two wrongs don't make a right, so if your chat logs don't speak well of you, that's something you need to work on. Riot still sees the whole log, so if you do ticket support about it they can see what you are talking about, however, your behaviour (and yours alone) is your responsibility, and thus so is your restriction.\n\nDefending yourself is fine, if not particularly useful in the face of negative individuals, but retaliation is not. Why should you be allowed to demonstrate the same negative behaviour as them? They will be punished just as you were.\n\n> Secondly...\n\nThe basis of the claims is a few factors. When a player is reported the game is flagged for review. No report means no risk of punishment, regardless of what may be said in the chat. Once a player is flagged the game is reviewed by the Instant Feedback System, an automated machine learning type that decides to punish or not based on history and severity. There are also regular manual reviews to maintain the integrity and accuracy of the automated system, as well as to handle cases the automated system cannot. \n\nMany people get pretty uneasy when an automated system is involved, but the false positive rate is **extremely** low, and when there is a false positive, it is usually resolved within a week through support (and only so long because an allowance of time for the ticket to be read given long queues is necessary)\n\nAs for no prior contact, the system essentially works on the 10 game chat restriction being your first warning to say \"Hey, you have a history of being a bit negative, and haven't shown any signs of improving/it being a once off thing. Your behaviour in these games was not ok, so take a bit of a break from chat and get your act together.\"\n\nFollowing warnings would be the 25 game chat restriction and then the 14 day ban, past which it is generally pretty clear that reform isn't an option, so the next punishment is a permanent suspension. You can drop punishment tiers, but it takes a good while, and relies on demonstrating no negative behaviour.\n\n> Finally...\n\nNo reports means no punishments. It is the players of the community who decide what is an isn't ok by way of what they report. The automated system learns from this, and expands it's knowledge on what is and isn't ok from the base that was built into it. So it is exactly as it says, the vast majority of players deem behaviour like what you demonstrated to be unacceptable, and thus you were punished for it.\n\nIt's worth noting that those who report inaccurately (e.g out of spite despite no wrongdoing) have their report weight reduced, so you can't just report someone and assume they'll get punished, there does have to be a valid issue there.\n\n> I would like to add...\n\nFrom a behaviour perspective, it doesn't matter how long you've played or how much money you've spent or not, everyone is treated equally. I don't want to say it's admirable you've gone that long without receiving a punishment, because really that should be the expectation of the community, not the highest standard, that said, I can understand how it would seem unreasonable for you to be being punished now when you never have been before.\n\nKeeping in mind that it doesn't matter who started it, only the behaviour shown, if you still feel the punishment is unjust you have a couple options. The first is to submit your chat logs here, and us here on boards can highlight where you went wrong, this is a means of community feedback, but would only be a confirmation or denial of unjust punishment. The second option is to submit a ticket to player support and have the case reviewed: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\n> I would very much appreciate...\n\nOne report is enough to trigger a punishment, but usually it's a couple games worth of reports that will net you a punishment, the exception would be particularly sever behaviour. If behaviour is sever enough (e.g hate speech) it can also skip you punishment tiers. It doesn't matter whether the person reporting was also negative, a valid report is still a valid report. How would you feel if your reports were now invalid just because you have been chat restricted? Report weight is determined separately from punishments.\n\nThe vast quantity of games would make it impossible for Riot to monitor every single report, hence the automated system, but it is also the reason for frequent manual reviews which I mentioned earlier. There has been talk of a new tribunal for community monitoring but no promises on anything yet. The execution would have to be completely different from the old system for something like that to work out.\n\n> P.S...\n\nAs I mentioned before, boards and support are the two places to talk about this stuff. If you don't wish to click I understand, it basically means to Riot that you are refusing to acknowledge any wrongdoing. As Tele said, this is prompting you to reflect on your behaviour, not judge and justify it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-11-27T13:10:05.660+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey summoner,\n\nAs **Miicka** already said the best thing to do is contact [Riot Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), but I can answer a few of your questions for you here :)\n\n__*\n\n>  I would like to inquire why the chat log only allows the subject in question to to view their own messages that were sent rather than the chat log of the whole game.\n\n + The idea behind the chat logs is to self reflect personally on **only** your behaviour that game. The aim is that people look at just what they said in chat and think _\"wow... did I really say that?\"_\n\n While having the context there might make your actions understandable, it doesn't make them ok or acceptable. It's also much harder to reflect on your actions when you can just shrug it off as _\"he called me a %%%%% first, so my actions after that were justified\"\n_\n\nLet me be very clear, context can matter. Especially when judging a case (which is why the [old Tribunal](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Tribunal_screen.png) had full chat logs), but in this case you are supposed to be reflecting on your behaviour, not judging it.\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n>  I would like to know the basis of the claims, how they are judged and why no prior contact is made to the player informing them exactly about the reasons for the decision\n\n+ The Instant Feedback System is what would have likely issued your chat restriction. \n\n The exact inner workings are fairly complex and not publicly available, but the system uses 'machine learning' from reports to see what kind of behaviour and words most players find unacceptable. (Follow me up on this for more info)\n\n It's not absolutely perfect since it can miss some types of behaviour, but generally it's quite good. Rioters also do quality assurance checks sometimes on reports it issues just in case something does go wrong.\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n> The message also stated that \"other\" players judged my comms to be far below the standards of the league community.\n\n+ Riot often has coded language like that (I don't like it either). What they actually mean is that people reported you for offensive behaviour. That includes consistent reports across multiple games not just in the game where you were punished (except in very very severe cases).\n\nDon't get the wrong idea though. Just people reporting you will not trigger any punishment. The Instant Feedback system needs evidence from your chat logs for it to issue punishment. \n\nI hope this helps, and feel free to reply with any questions :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"KyongHwan","date":"2016-12-02T20:53:29.770+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The idea behind the chat logs is to self reflect personally on only your behaviour that game. The aim is that people look at just what they said in chat and think \"wow... did I really say that?\"\n\nThank you for clarifying this for me, I understand the notion behind allowing the individual to view their behaviour in order to help them understand the negative impact that their actions could have on the game/team. Basic developmental psychology 101 :D\n\n> Defending yourself is fine, if not particularly useful in the face of negative individuals, but retaliation is not. Why should you be allowed to demonstrate the same negative behaviour as them? They will be punished just as you were.\n\nI also understand the fact that this is something of a problem. However, the question I would like clarification on was how the summoner under scrutiny could be able to get the full chat log in order to be able to appeal/refute the restriction without the necessary evidence being provided? Is there some way that I could potentially fetch the chat log from the previous game so that I may be able to quote certain aspects of the chat that may have been the trigger for certain responses? How and when can you draw the line between defending yourself and retaliation? \n\nUnfortunately, in such a competitive scene such as league where often times stress levels can soar quite high, people can and I have personally experienced players \"retaliate\", feeling that they are simply defending themselves from the barrage of insults they are receiving from the corresponding player. \n\nThe reason I was hoping to be able to view the complete chat log is not simply to state \"He called me this, so I called him that\", but rather to be able to effectively present a case to Riot in the format of \"this was stated by the player, I understand that I too was at fault with certain behaviours that were displayed in my chat. However, having been treated in such a manner (Example A), I reacted in a way that was highly uncharacteristic of myself. Please note that I attempted to diffuse the situation prior to the commencement of such behaviour (Please refer to example B)\", this would allow the summoner in question to be able to write a detailed report that would highly increase their chances of appealing the matter resulting in a favourable outcome. \n\n> When a player is reported the game is flagged for review. No report means no risk of punishment, regardless of what may be said in the chat. \n\nI seem to find this highly unethical... I understand that it is almost impossible for Riot to manually review all chat logs or games due to the sheer quantity of games being played in any given instance. However, \"No report means no risk of punishment\"? If this is truly the case, then I would like to reiterate the previous statement that there should be a system implemented that would allow a more thorough investigation on the players who have been reported. I say this due to the fact that, as mentioned above, certain times due to stress caused by multiple different reasons (eg. leavers, toxic behaviour, trolls etc.), I personally deter from reporting many playing due to being highly empathetic and understanding that this could happen to the best of summoner's.\n\nI understand this system is in place in order to encourage summoners to utilise the report system. However, this would indicate that in most cases had the restriction not been brought to the attention of Riot through the ticket submission or on the message boards as I am currently doing, most likely due to the high quantity of reports Riot would once again be forced to review what was stated by the reporting player without taking into account the full scope of the problem and/or the Instant Feedback System would be programmed to review the chat of the accused player over the accusing player. Again this would direct me to think that it would be more effective to be able to view the complete chat log to file an appeal that would allow the summoner being punished to present their case more effectively.\n\n> From a behaviour perspective, it doesn't matter how long you've played or how much money you've spent or not, everyone is treated equally. I don't want to say it's admirable you've gone that long without receiving a punishment, because really that should be the expectation of the community, not the highest standard, that said, I can understand how it would seem unreasonable for you to be being punished now when you never have been before.\n\nI included this in my original post in order to present the case more effectively by stating all mitigating factors that would be beneficial to my appeal. Unfortunately, due to the limited evidence that I possess, it is extremely difficult to present these factors other than showing that I have no prior record of punishment. Much like in the court of law, an individual being convicted on multiple occasions is generally sentenced with a harsher punishment. As such, I was attempting to show that this was uncharacteristic of myself and that I would appreciate if Riot could investigate the matter in order to determine why I would have acted as such when I have no prior record of doing so. \n\nI would like to add that this was by no means mentioned as a means for me to state that my behaviour was admirable as I have not been punished in the past. I do understand that being punished should be the minority rather than the status quo.\n\n> Keeping in mind that it doesn't matter who started it, only the behaviour shown, if you still feel the punishment is unjust you have a couple options. The first is to submit your chat logs here, and us here on boards can highlight where you went wrong, this is a means of community feedback, but would only be a confirmation or denial of unjust punishment.\n\nOnce again without supporting evidence that would accurately depict both sides of the case, I would like to refrain from doing so. In turn I would like to pose a question on this matter in the form of a case scenario.\n\nIndividual A has accused individual B of assault. The court has been presented with video evidence of Individual B assaulting Individual A.\n\nThe court has requested for the accused (Individual B) to present counter evidence in order to determine whether this was the case. However, the only evidence that Individual B has acquired was the video that was provided to the court of Individual B assaulting Individual A.\n\nWould the accused be able to present an effective case in order to show the court their innocence? Would they have any power in appealing the matter at hand without more evidence? Highly unlikely. Presenting such one sided evidence would rather be detrimental to his case. Much like your request for the current chat log in my case.\n\nHowever, if the accused (Individual B) was able to acquire such evidence of prior events that showed that Individual A had assaulted the accused prior to the commencement of the evidence presented by Individual A, how then would you imagine that the course of events would proceed?\n\nI would appreciate the community to reflect upon this rather than what you have requested. I have therefore taken up your second option of submitting a ticket to Riot and am still waiting on the results of the investigation.\n\n> As I mentioned before, boards and support are the two places to talk about this stuff. If you don't wish to click I understand, it basically means to Riot that you are refusing to acknowledge any wrongdoing. As Tele said, this is prompting you to reflect on your behaviour, not judge and justify it.\n\nI believe that you have misunderstood the OP. I stated this due to the fact that in any given circumstance whether it be electronic, verbal or written (this case an electronic agreement), once an agreement has been given it is legally binding and therefore I would lose all power to appeal the matter as I have now agreed to the punishment being enforced by Riot. As mentioned, I believe that the punishment was unjust due to the multiple number of factors provided above and that I would appreciate an investigation to take place in order to determine whether there could potentially be mitigating factors that should be taken into account in this case.\n\nPlease do not misunderstand my intentions of not clicking on the \"I Understand\" button. I do understand ,as I have clearly shown in this post, that I too was wrong in the behaviour that I portrayed during the games that were mentioned by Riot to myself. However, I am simply requesting that the suspension be reviewed and potentially revoked before I click on the \"I Understand\" button, which would effectively mean that I am pleading guilty and \"understand\", that I must carry out the suspension placed on my account.\n\nFinally, I would like to add that League is one of my favourite past times and by no means am I writing in order to offend or provoke Riot or any of the community. I am simply writing this in order to question some of the processes that are currently in place in the hopes that:\n\n1. My case could be reviewed and investigated due to the mitigating factors present in this case\n2. Explain certain aspects of the reporting system that (I believe) could potentially be improved\n3. Create awareness of certain problems that could have potentially affected players who have been faced with a similar problem\n\nFollowing the investigation, if Riot still deems that my behaviour in these limited number of games deserves the punishment in the form of a chat suspension, I will gladly carry out the suspension and continue engaging in my favourite past time and will definitely work to correct my flaws.\n\nKind Regards,\n\nKyong Hwan (Raphael) Kim","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-03T04:57:04.418+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> how the summoner under scrutiny could be able to get the full chat log in order to be able to appeal/refute the restriction\n\nRiot can see the whole chat logs, so if you talk about the chat log of your team they can see what you're talking about it. I realise there is an element of trust there, but aside from the whole 'reflect on your own behaviour' thing, it also protects other players (whether they were in the wrong or no) from things like witch-hunting.\n\n> certain aspects of the chat that may have been the trigger for certain responses\n\nIf you could open a dialogue with support it's possible they would be able to clarify some for you, but given their workload it is unlikely they would be able to help you too much (that's why this boards community is a thing). If you can remember any specifics I'd be happy to go over it with you.\n\n> How and when can you draw the line between defending yourself and retaliation?\n\nIt's a difficult one certainly, there is quite a bit of grey area which makes defining these so hard, but to give a general example. \"BUT I DIDN\"T DO ANYTHING!\" or \"I HAD X ON ME I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING\" is fine, but \"NO, FUCK YOU\" or \"YOU TOXIC PIECE OF SHIT\" or \"SHUT THE FUCK UP\" not so much. I tried to pick some more borderline cases to help clarify, as things like hate speech or death threats even against a toxin should be a pretty obvious no-go. \n\nThe easiest way I draw that line is consider how I would feel if someone said x to me. If I would be offended by it (even if not overly affected) then it's probably not the best thing to say. Best advice I can give you however is that, if you are unsure, don't say anything at all, or say it to your screen but don't type it. If I'm in comms with someone I'll often rant about a toxic player (happened last night in fact), but I won't type anything, because I know they aren't worth my time. Especially if they've been toxic since second 1 >:(\n\n>  this would allow the summoner in question to be able to write a detailed report that would highly increase their chances of appealing the matter resulting in a favourable outcome.\n\nPerhaps I can clarify a little on this one. As I understand it you are facing a 10 game chat restriction yes? This punishment is pretty much a warning. It's to say hey, this has gotten a little more serious than the occasional tilt fest, and we just need to let you know that this behaviour isn't ok (regardless of circumstance). Assume you avoid the behaviour that got you in trouble (finding other ways to vent is your best bet) then you aren't in any danger of another punishment. \n\nGenerally you'll follow the tiers 10 game rest. > 25 game rest. > 14 day account ban > permanent ban. The system is designed around encouraging reform, and the vast majority of players that receive a punishment never see another. I get the feeling you'll probably be one of those since you're taking the time to understand.\n\n> I seem to find this highly unethical...\n\nThe behaviour bans are largely managed by the machine learning automated system, i.e the instant feedback system. However appealing a ban through support will get you a manual review of your case. The vast majority don't see any change, Occasionally a punishment will be reduced or increased following a manual review, but VERY rarely are they removed. The IFS has a very good accuracy rate. I should clarify that the \"no report no punishment\" only applies to behaviour bans, not things like cheating (an I believe intent feeding) as they have other means of detection and verification in place as well.\n\nBasically with your report you are deciding if you feel that player was deserving of a punishment. You mention your empathic response, which is perfectly ok. I am in much the same boat, where if I feel someone's toxicity is borne out of rare frustration then I usually won't report (unless they cross the lines that I deem too far). For the most part the system won't punish those players anyway, as it has to be more than very rare toxicity (unless it is severe behaviour) to trigger a punishment. A bad week would do it, but a bad game would not.\n\nAs I mentioned, ticketing support will get your case manually reviewed.\n\n>  the Instant Feedback System would be programmed to review the chat of the accused player over the accusing player\n\nA report flags the game as well as the player and all chat is considered when determining a punishment. Report weight isn't reduced by what punishments you have received or how many reports you have submitted, only their accuracy.\n\n> As such, I was attempting to show that this was uncharacteristic of myself\n\nHence this is only a 10 game chat restriction. I know it isn't the clearest thing, but remember that this is more a warning than a punishment. It's meant to give you some down time to think about what you should and shouldn't be allowed to say in chat, and once that has been considered hopefully you won't have to deal with the punishment system ever again.\n\n> Presenting such one sided evidence would rather be detrimental to his case. \n\nPerhaps not the cleanest analogy but I'll run with it. Even if you were to assume person A had assaulted person B first, to compare this to the whole retaliation vs defence thing, the video would should person B wailing on person A well past the point they are able to defend them self. It's that matter of taking things too far. \n\nIt would be like someone coming at you with a knife with intent to kill, but they're blocked by a locked door with no way in and you shoot them 6 times anyway. Self defence could be argued, but it would definitely be considered excessive force and you would get in trouble too (theoretically anyway). Again sorry it's not the cleanest analogy, the grey area is hard to define.\n\n> As mentioned, I believe that the punishment was unjust...\n\nIndeed I did misunderstand a little, however I don't want you to get your hopes up. Without seeing the logs and without seeing any kind of report history (as Riot does) I cannot confirm or agree with your claims. I can say that Riot won't ban anyone without justification (even though they legally have that right) but that comes down to a trust issue, and given you feel the punishment was unjustified I imagine what trust you had in them has been a bit shaken.\n\nI do have to mention that your perspective and Riot's will not be the same, and you're going to have to accept that going in if you want a proper discussion out of support. Riot's perspective is essentially that it doesn't matter who started it. It may be a rare occurrence for you, but there were either enough cases in a small time frame or it was a more severe case for you to get an actual punishment for this. I have little expectation of you getting your punishment removed in all honesty, but there are some important things to remember:\n\nFirst of all, this punishment is not a mark against your account forever. If you show good behaviour once the restriction is up you'll get loot back in as little as a week, and your account will drop back to good standing in about 3 months. Neither are definite timelines, but assuming no hiccups that's the general timeframe you'd be seeing (NOTE: the first is a visible change in that you will start earning loot again, the second however is not and depends entirely on continued lack of negative behaviour).\n\n> which would effectively mean that I am pleading guilty and \"understand\", that I must carry out the suspension placed on my account.\n\nI wish I could remove the stigma there. In this case pleading guilty and carrying out the suspension isn't a bad thing. It's an acknowledgement and correction of a mistake, which is an admirable quality, not something that should be condemned. Everyone fucks up, it how you handle the fuck ups that's important.\n\n> 1.\n\nYour case will be reviewed through support, but as I said don't get your hopes up too high. You may also receive a macro response, since support is busy and have to get through cases as quickly as possible, so if you do get one, just respond to the ticket with the key points you want addressed and keep it as short and sweet as possible.\n\n> 2. \n\nHopefully I did an adequate enough job here. Obviously your perspective differs a bit from mine (and from Riot's), but hopefully you can at least understand the reasons the systems are they way they are. I don't disagree they could be improved, though perhaps in different ways than what you feel though. There's always room for improvement.\n\n> 3. \n\nYour kind of issue is something that's handled case by case. For the most part players in your situation will take the 10 game hit and never see a punishment again, but Riot avoids concrete rules here for a couple reasons. One is to deter those who wish to skirt the line of what is punishable for the sake of continuing to be toxic, and the other is to leave the door open for discussion and shifts in what is and isn't acceptable (as determined by the community via what they choose to report or not report).\n\n___\n\nAs an extra note, if you want some feedback on your logs but don't want to post them here then you're welcome to add me in game and I can take a  look for you if you want.\n\nLet me know how it goes with support :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"KyongHwan","date":"2016-12-02T21:21:03.351+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"P.S.
