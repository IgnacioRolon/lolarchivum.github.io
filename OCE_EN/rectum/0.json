The forum was quite lively, lots of views to a thread. \r\nhttp://forums.oce.leagueoflegends.com/board/forumdisplay.php?f=59\r\n\r\nNow, we barely get pass 70 on average. This new moderating method that seem to cater so heavily on possitive reinforcement; Anything that seem to resemble discontent or arguement, get deleted by the carebear mod. When people say stupid things, you let it go. When people retort back to the stupid comments, they get banned. Lol alrighty then. \r\n\r\nWhat a great thing you have going for the forum huh? A forum on a state of decline compare to the **past**. yes! instead of growth we&#039;re getting less and less people visiting the forum because of the restricted freedom of speech.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-03-25T19:02:05.090+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do notice a stark difference in the number of people that post in this forum vs the NA forum. I don't think this has to do with moderators, since similar, but not the same, rules govern both boards. I think it boils down to fewer red posts and fewer people showing up to the boards.\n\nIf someone were violating the boards' Universal Rules, then I can see why there'd be action taken against them. Freedom of speech protects you from government action, and not from private institutions. If you start yelling profanities in Denny's (or the Oceanic equivalent), they have the right to not serve you and kick you out.\n\nYou're being critical of the moderation, but not violating anything on the boards, except for maybe posting in the wrong section, but I'm not sure where you would post this.\n\nIf you do have an issue with moderators here, you might be able to discuss that with moderators on the Boards Discord.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-03-25T12:23:09.470+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"The issues of the boards being \"dead\" were existent from long, *long* before these \"supposed\" issues of \"biased\" comment deletion.
