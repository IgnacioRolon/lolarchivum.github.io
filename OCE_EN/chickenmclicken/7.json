I&#039;ve been playing this game for around 4 years and spent over 200 dollars, I know I was shit talking but I don&#039;t want everything I have done and worked for to go to waste, I was want another chance I know I probably don&#039;t deserve it but I need this... Just tell me I I can email someone...","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2017-08-21T09:28:01.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"perma ban is for repeated offender.

They will take you through the process and determine whether the ban was rightful or a false positive. The ban will only be revoked if it is determined to be a false positive. Keep in mind, the punishment systems are based *solely* on your behaviour, not that of other players, so using excuses such as \"they started it\" (this is probably the most common excuse) will certainly not fly here.\n\nShould the ban not be revoked and you wish to continue playing, there is nothing stopping you from making another account. Keep in mind, however, that repeating the same behaviour on another account is a good way to get that one banned as well, so it may pay to reflect on what has lead you to this point (even if you choose to switch to another game, really, as they'll likely be using fairly similar criteria).","replies":[{"poster":"ChickenMclicken","date":"2017-08-19T07:34:05.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't get 200 dollars and over 1000 hours back by making another account, but thanks.","replies":[]}]}]}
