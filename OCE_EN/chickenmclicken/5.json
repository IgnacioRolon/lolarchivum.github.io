They have the most unbalanced system for banning. Games should not have a ban system in general. People dont purchase games to be punished. They play to be involved in the community regardless of how it operates. In  the real world, there is no pathetic system for speech that offends someone. Riot, just like your champions in game, your banning system and afk system are unbalanced. Here's some free speech, go fuck yourself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-22T03:55:01.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you queue up and join a game, you have a responsibility to your team to be there until it ends, even if you don't think there's a good chance of winning.\n\nI recommend you open up Rick and Morty on a second screen as you play instead :P (kappa)","replies":[{"poster":"GankyLiraffe","date":"2016-12-22T08:20:23.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A responsibility to be glued to your computer? Do you know how stupid that is depending on the scenario? But no, the gaming system doesn't take into consideration the variables of the real world or the player if they go afk. It takes broad sweeps of the community and generalises the entire situation. So when you say responsibility, it doesn't exist. Stop getting sucked into the BS nonsense of social responsibility in a gaming situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-22T20:47:54.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right, sometimes you don't have a choice and you must leave due to a **rare** real life emergency. Riot understands this and [allows you to leave some games unpunished](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ#h3q3). \n\nThe system only starts to punish you once you start to AFK frequently. If your real life emergency or technical issues are happening constantly, then you need to take the time to sort those out before you queue up again. We can help with fixing any technical issues here too.\n\nAlso, _why do you think there is no responsibility for you to finish a game?_ \n\nWhen you leave a game it's almost always guaranteed loss for 4 other players. Every time you AFK you waste people's time in-game. So the system wastes your time in Low Priority Queue next time you play. It's a fair punishment.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
