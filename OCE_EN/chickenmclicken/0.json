The thing that comes to mind first is 3rd party software (such as scripts/bots) and/or cheating (such as exploits), which typically are escalated straight through. It *might* also occur in the event Riot has reason to believe the account has been compromised, in which case the ban is simply a temporary measure to prevent further abuse of the account until the original owner can reclaim it (by providing certain information regarding the account).\n\nDepending on the reason for the ban (which ideally should have been made clear in the reform card [in-client pop-up] and/or email [to registered email address]), your best bet is to submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and address the issue with them (or ask them for clarification if you can't find a reason for the punishment in the reform card/email). In the case of a 3rd party software and/or cheating ban, you should use the \"Account suspensions or restrictions\" option to appeal, however in the case of compromise, you will need to make sure you're logged out and use the \"Recover my account\" option.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Candy4lif3","date":"2018-12-02T04:22:07.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please elaborate of what crime you have committed so we can do a thorough examination to see what you did was unjust","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-12-01T10:35:23.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it fair to imprison a murderer right after he is convicted?\nOr should we give them warnings first and only imprison them the second time?","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-12-01T07:02:25.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends what they did.
