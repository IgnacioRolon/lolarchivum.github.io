And I am FAIRLY certain that my account has over 2,500 hours in normal games alone if my progress wasn&#039;t wiped. Could a Rioter please look into this and check because I feel a bit cheated that I&#039;m not getting the conqueror emote considering I&#039;ve played since the start of Season 2.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is I don&#039;t believe I&#039;ve received the adequate amount of blue essence to compensate for the Runes and Rune pages changes. Having had 14 Rune pages and basically every rune in the game that was viable, the total amount of blue essence for compensation I was given was under 8000 blue essence. A bit stingy considering I spent countless hours grinding out 14 runepages worth of IP and even more grinding out most of the viable runes.\r\n\r\nIF a Rioter could look into this, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2017-11-07T07:17:28.419+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Ringbear\n\nThat does sound strange and definitely something that is worth looking at.   First up I'd suggest initially that it might be best to get a support ticket in, so we can track this properly.   The same goes for anyone else who might read this and be in a similar situation (one-off transfer from SEA).\n\nI'll also see what I can find out about it, but it might take a few days to track down.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Ringbear","date":"2017-11-07T07:20:35.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll do that as soon as possible.

You've not been forgotten though!\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"flex like ouu","date":"2017-11-07T10:06:05.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey, this is exactly the same case with me. I have played since season 2 and with an using  (wastedonlol) when it worked I already had clocked well over 2.5k hours in season 3. I am one of those garbage division locked monkeys that have atleast close to 1k ranked games or more per season. So I feel atleast being given a reward based of game time would be nice, but I only got the \"champion\" one, which is the second bestone :/ I already sent in a support ticket but it has yet to be replied to. is there anything you could do about it","replies":[{"poster":"MrDoomydoom","date":"2017-11-08T16:18:44.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same problem here, just started season 3 but have consistently clocked in games since then, in NA though so its not just OCE. sending in a support ticket soon","replies":[]}]}]}]}
