Dont get me wrong its a unique item and amazing but the problem is being in low diamond elo you have to 1 man carry everyone and once two tanks build Adaptive helm bam i am useless on Cass even with Void Staff, Morells and Liandries i do nothing. They just run straight through me its a complete joke i hope the passive can be nerfed a little because i feel like its making cass very weak into tanks for her being a tank shredder. Not only that i found funny when i vsed a mundo who was out healing my damage with Adaptive helm.","replies":[]}
