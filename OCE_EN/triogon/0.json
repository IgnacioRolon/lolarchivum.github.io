I bought a cheap rune to see if that will update my in store IP however it just lowered the amount of &quot;store IP&quot; relative to me client IP.  In the screen shot I have attached it shows that my client has 6303 but the store tells me I have 5915 IP. Any assistance in fixing this issue would be greatly appreciated.\n\n*First time making post I don't know if this is the right place.","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2015-09-25T01:06:19.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Triogon,\n\nThanks for the detailed report!
