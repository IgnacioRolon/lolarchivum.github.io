Anyway, assuming so...\n\nHis behavior was pretty appalling, he was making extremely rude comments in game and in the post-game chat, I added him asked him if he'd like to 1v1, at which point he said this.\n\nJust wanted to warn fellow solo queue players, and also the Ardent team, that this is how one of your players behaves when he thinks nobody is looking.\n\n(posted from my smurf, Sinai is my main).","replies":[{"poster":"Jacki","date":"2015-01-25T10:14:14.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Uhh why are you Whining so hard, do didn't provide evidence of him saying anything remotely toxic or \"name and shame\" worthy....","replies":[{"poster":"Ailias","date":"2015-01-26T04:04:36.033+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zezima,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=WEElytIk,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-01-25T10:14:14.330+0000)\n>\n> Uhh why are you Whining so hard, do didn't provide evidence of him saying anything remotely toxic or \"name and shame\" worthy....\n\nExcept maybe, 'kill urself' ?!\n\nI don't know why anyone thinks this is remotely okay to say to anyone.","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-01-26T04:11:57.502+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"^\n\nHIRE THIS MAN RIOT.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jacki","date":"2015-01-26T09:29:26.334+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Maybe you should stop intentionally provoking people.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dunkmaster Vi","date":"2015-01-25T13:40:13.944+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol 1v1 in netball that is actually such a good comparison to lol for 1v1's","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-01-25T10:07:34.348+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Name and Shame.

You are provoking them - smart move, get yourself banned as well I guess? You accepted or sent a friend request to them - not sure you understand how dumb that is. You wanted to 1v1 them - this isn't CoD, and LoL isn't anything like a 1v1 game, so that's pretty stupid and makes you sound like a child. This is nothing, grow the hell up and stop whining. Use a damn mute button or block them or something, and stop provoking them like a 12 year old.
