I&#039;m set in all other lanes\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not great at assassins or mages and love all in chaps like J4, Maokai and Sejuani.\r\n\r\nWhat champions would you recommend for mid? Or do I have to bite the bullet and learn assassin champions?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2015-10-06T21:37:46.358+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Swain, vlad can be the kind of champs that hang around and fuck shit up while soaking damage for the team. Tbh you could roam maokai pretty effectively. If you really need some big damage while feeling like you're 'all in' on a fight, look at kennen. Galio scales with MR and does SUPER well against anyone with a DOT (malz, brand, nexus turret :p) but is generally a good pick against AP mids and has that all in tank feel. You could even run revive karthus ðŸ˜‚","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-10-07T00:48:26.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THAT IS NOT FUNNY!!!\n\nRIP revive :'(","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-10-13T04:50:23.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(â—¡ â€¿ â—¡ âœ¿) ...\n\nãƒ˜(â—•ã€‚â—•ãƒ˜)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-10-13T04:48:19.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yasuo is actually a fighter, so you can give him a try, he is great at killing non mobile/skill shot/squishy champs, while also being able to soak a decent amount of damage and dishing out a lot.

Lux is a very safe and low skill floor mid laner who is fantastic in the current meta, she scales hard late game and is still a serviceable lane bully early game. Veigar is again a very low skillcap mid laner with great zone control from his E and massive AoE damage from W, he can use Q to farm into late game and has decent sustain from his passive. Brand is on the verge of breaking out as a dominant mid laner because his passive applies Rylai's Crystal Scepter and Luden's Echo, effectively giving him a 5 second slow that can also potentially be AoE, to put it short, he's just insane with items. Ahri is just really safe and has boatloads of mobility and a great CC spell in charm. Vel'koz is a great champion with large amounts of CC for a mage, in addition his passive gives him true damage and his damage is insane, he is a serviceable lane bully but is harder than the aforementioned champions.\n\nGangplank is kind of a flex pick and is quite hard to play effectively but when played well he is great against squishy immobile mages since he can cleanse their CC spells with W, walk up to their face and bully them hard, his barrels give him a lot of damage and his passive lets him stick to these mages easily but he does get bullied quite easily until level 3 and he is melee.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-10-06T23:25:45.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you want mid but don't want to be assassin try Yasuo since he is a fighter champion.\n\nBut I would recommend a more AP mage such as: Orianna, Azir, Twisted Fate.\n\nalso the AD assassins such as Talon and Zed.\n\nAlthough if you want tank mid Cho'Gath is quite good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-10-06T22:48:26.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahri is basically all you'll ever need.
