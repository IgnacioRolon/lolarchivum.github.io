Dealing with a HAM player","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im playing with a mate who goes HAM all the time (and usually dies). I want to try and show/explain to him that at times objectives are more beneficial that kills. He gets the blinkers on going for the kills, when the better team thing to do could be getting a tower.\r\n\r\nI understand its always going to be situational  with objectives v kills. Objectives gives you gold and map presence. Both of those allow you to get kills easier. \r\n\r\nIve trying to show that my focusing on objectives and map presence will equal more kills. Keeping his quest to kill and help the team moving forward.\r\n\r\nI cant find any videos/forums to show him to support this.\r\n\r\nHas anyone got any they can share or have you played with people like this before and realised its just a lost cause?","replies":[{"poster":"ErÃ¸se","date":"2016-01-14T01:08:07.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't play with mates who are like this tbh.
