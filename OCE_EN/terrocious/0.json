There&#039;s a lot of Bioshock fans out there (like me) who could tell you how awesome this skin would be. Sadly I don&#039;t have any concept art, due to the fact that I have the same artistic skills as a potato, but I do have a couple ideas.\r\n\r\n      There are two different ways you could do the skin. Both ways you do it, you dress Annie up like a Little Sister, which means you giver her the same hair style, clothing, eyes, etc. as a little sister from Bioshock (but keep the trademark red hair). Now here&#039;s where the differences occur; little sisters are infamous for having a big daddy, who follows them around and kills anything that stands in his or the little sister&#039;s way. Now my original idea was to give Tibbers the Big Daddy equipment, but keep him the same for the most part. Things like giving him a drill arm and a diving helmet would fit really well with this skin. The overall combination of the two would make a really nice crossover between the two games, and a lot of Bioshock fans would be crawling over each other to get this skin.\r\n\r\n      My second idea for this skin was to make an accompanying &#039;Big Daddy Nautilus&#039; skin for the &#039;Little Sister Annie&#039; skin. Just like with Tibbers, you&#039;d give him some of the Big Daddy equipment, although you could really pull of the Big Daddy look on a champion like Nautilus. The only problem with this part is that I wouldn&#039;t know what to do with Annie&#039;s Tibbers.\r\n\r\n       Now, I know that this idea is far fetched, and that it would be a pain in the butt to get licensing and stuff, but as a Bioshock and League of Legends fan, I think this would make a fantastic crossover. I was just hoping that, due to my artistic in ability to create anything, that some of you guys out there could create some art of &#039;Little Sister Annie&#039; or &#039;Big Daddy Nautilus&#039; :D.
