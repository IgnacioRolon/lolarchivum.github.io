There is one notification, but it's very limited, and not seeing it doesn't mean no-one was punished.\n\nIt can be frustrating, but with an emphasis on reform, and on preventing things like witch-hunting, Riot has to keep things pretty private.\n\nA lack of clear feedback doesn't mean the system does nothing, and one report is all it takes to get a game reviewed. If you feel a report wasn't adequately addressed, or for whatever reason couldn't use post-game reporting, you can submit a ticket via player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nTwo important notes: Support cannot and will not tell you *anything* about another player's account, implicit or otherwise, so you will get a generic \"thanks for the report\" type response, and manual reviews are much slower than automatic ones, so you should always use post-game reporting where possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-10-03T23:28:16.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Support cannot tell you anything about the account? \n\nTrue, though I do recall a few seasons back, you would get a notification if a player you reported got punished.\n\nManual reviews take a long time? \n\nTrue, they probably haven't even gotten around to starting.\n\nSomeone was punished?\n\nSorta True, whilst I've yet to see a ban recently (in the ol' days, Riot seemed a bit more open to banning inexcusable behavior), I'm sure some of them got chat restricted for 10 games or so, but I'm not sure this is really going to make them reform.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rilez","date":"2019-10-03T05:00:33.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Sorry you experienced this, I can assure you there is some good in the community too.
