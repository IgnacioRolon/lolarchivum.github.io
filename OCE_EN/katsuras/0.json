I thought the 490 RP mystery gift gave you 520 RP skins or better, and without having actually counted, the 520 RP skins seem to make up roughly one third of the skins you can unlock?","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-26T00:09:19.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"even, if it does include 520 skins (which out of 10 never one got, (really wish bandit sivir was 520, its ugly as hell, wouldn't have got it if it was) just got the cruddy looking 750 skins, only good one was meh sexy {{champion:4}}  1 ^^) you did receive if for free, and you most likely already have the skin anyway, in the view of many people, even the normal mystery for the code wouldn't be worth, because the simple fact still stands, it was free, and rp cost money","replies":[{"poster":"Katsuras","date":"2015-08-26T04:17:03.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You didn't _know_ I got the code for free. I did but I don't think that's relevant, I still had to earn it and it definitely doesn't detract from the value of it so I'm going to have to disagree with you completely, most people wouldn't think it's not worth it at all. I'm doing someone a favour here, I could easily let this code just sit there and expire, but instead I'm giving someone a skin for 790 RP that would normally cost 975 RP. Of course I benefit from this as well, but as I said, it's win-win.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
