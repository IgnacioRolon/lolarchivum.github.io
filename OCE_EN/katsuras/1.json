I could not foresee this problem happening, and I apologised to my teammates and tried playing to the best of my ability. As I could barely move all game, I decided to play safe and sit under the turret for most of the game. I did not AFK and I ended 2/1 and I was the same level as someone on the other team. When the game finished I got a warning for supposedly being AFK. I&#039;ve been playing LoL for something like 4 years now and I&#039;ve never once received so much as a warning before. I&#039;m just wondering if this was some sort of error that needs to be looked into or do people legitimately get punished for this now?","replies":[{"poster":"Katsuras","date":"2015-08-10T14:24:40.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump.","replies":[]}]}
