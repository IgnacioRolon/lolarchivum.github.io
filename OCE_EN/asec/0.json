Of course, you probably don't want to do that because it takes ages to do.\n\nYou can try the following: Go to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_game_client in your Windows Explorer, if you're on Windows, and then delete the folder named \"filearchives\". On Mac, this can (probably) be done by right clicking the League of Legends icon and then searching through its contents. I don't use a Mac myself, so I can't be sure.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[{"poster":"asec","date":"2015-03-28T02:46:02.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks man!
