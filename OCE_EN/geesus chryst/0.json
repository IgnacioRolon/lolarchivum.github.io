Once in game it runs smoothly with high fps and minimal lag. This issue didn&#039;t appear when i went to my parents house for the weekend, and I have a friend in the same area as me who uses the same type of mobile broadband that I do and he doesn&#039;t get the error at all. It&#039;s starting to negatively affect my gameplay with temporary bans because of constant quitting / disconnecting.  \r\nDoes anyone know how to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-23T01:43:32.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly, I'd hold tight a bit, because the servers aren't running at their best atm.\n\nSecondly, what ISP is that mobile broadband stick for?","replies":[{"poster":"Geesus Chryst","date":"2015-05-23T17:55:25.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's Vodafone NZ","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-27T12:57:53.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried using it in a different location? ie. if you go to your friend's house and use it on his computer, does it still lag like hell?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
