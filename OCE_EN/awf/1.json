But honestly, who cares? Here's the thing: people who play this game take it really, really seriously for some reason, so they tend to be pretty good. Not great, obviously, but the standard is pretty high. I'm a normal human being, I'm not stupid and I don't have any major shortcomings (apart from being incredibly old by LoL standards), and I think I'm in the bottom 5-10% of people who play ranked. Maybe even the bottom 1%... but hey, there's always got to be a bottom 1%, right? Even if you took the 100 best players on the planet, one of them would be in the bottom 1% of that group.\n\nAnyway, my point is... um, I forget. I really need to stop posting stuff during the periods where my brain has shut down. I guess my point is that there's no shame in being bad, and _someone's_ got to be at the bottom of the barrel. It's an honourable position, actually. At least, that's what I tell myself.\n\nThat said, maybe you're awesome and you've just had bad luck with your teams.
