Like, are people getting boosted to Platinum or is there just an influx of shitters because we&#039;re nearing the end of the season?","replies":[{"poster":"Belrick","date":"2016-09-05T08:37:23.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are good like you clearly up. the match maker will match you with shit players who get rofl stomped by ave players and you get smacked\n\nThe match maker cannot seem to make balanced teams. I get about 3 good games in 10.  The rest are one sided stomps which sucks regardless if i win or lose.\n\nWorse, i am a support. If i get rated highly im fucked because supports can't carry. STOP GIVING ME HIGH MATCH RATINGS RIOT I SUP MAIN!!!!\n\nI win lane with my adc in most games... has little impact on games outcomes\nOther lanes are far more important.\n\nA top with less gold can 1 vs 1 slay a solo adc. Thats how the game is balanced and is why ADC need supports.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2016-09-05T03:43:43.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand the feeling.
