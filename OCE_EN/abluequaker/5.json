Well it should since Riot hasn't made any moves to tone it down or anything alike that from my view. Hopefully they'll re-release that game mode alongside Dominion in the near future, have a good time in the Fields of Justice and may you be Victorious.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-10-04T06:52:41.767+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can I gently remind everyone of my 3 hour queue time experience at peak hours a few weeks ago?
