Nerfing and buffing policy still needs the change however.\n\nYou don't choose what is the meta for the players, you don't balance or counter balance because some emerged meta is undesirable for you.\n\nAfter years of consecutive failures in the balancing scene I am pretty sure Riot knows somewhere in their heart, that the today's shoe holed meta is half their fault (the other half is the players'). Hence S4 and now S5.\n\nS3 particularly was the product of this type of balancing taken into extreme.
