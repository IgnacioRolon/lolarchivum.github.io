Single objective: push towers. What pushes towers? ADCs. You hit mid-to-late game itemization 7 minutes in without even having to cs. What benefits from this? ADCs.\r\n\r\nThis game mode is literally cancer (except if I cut my balls off the cancer is still there - actual cancer would be easier to deal with) and I don&#039;t want to see it again indefinitely (ideally never).","replies":[{"poster":"Yasho The ADC","date":"2016-09-03T12:10:57.159+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why play it to begin with? Especially with an opinion like that? If you don't like the game mode, don't play it. I don't like it so i don't play it, but i know other people do so saying \"I don't want to see it again indefinitely (ideally never).\" just ain't right. \nSo don't play it and have a cry about it later.

Were you Ashe? lmao\n\nWave clear champs are also good. I love Ziggs a lot since he can take turrets + clear waves (and isn't an ADC)\n\nI also have fun playing Kat. AP Kat on Defense and AD Kat offense lmao legit works great since you want sustain and to take towers\n\nBut yeah, anyway, just don't play it fam. I don't like a lot of the other game modes, therefore I don't play them.
