As it is a English Region just like EU and NA.","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2015-02-09T14:05:46.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keep in mind that Brasil, LA, Russia and Turkey all have non-English speaking casters whereas we actually have English speaking casters.\n\nRiot could at least advertise OPL on the LoL Esports website - even if the stream itself is on the OCE Riot Channel.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-09T15:53:56.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You remember DP?\n\nYou know that laughing stock team that was in worlds, the one that got utterly raped?\n\nYeah we are basically like that compared to NA, EUW, etc.\n\nFact is teamwise, we are decent, just not good (and probably about in line with DP.)","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2015-02-10T01:44:35.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shouldn't that be even more reason for us to adopt the LCS format?
