Why do you need to know who gets banned? Just because they popped up in your game once and ruined it, it doesn't mean they've done it before, could be their first or it could've been your attitude that caused them to act in such a way that disregarded the rest of the team. \nI'm not sure if the chat restriction is manual or automated, but I'm pretty sure for both, bans and chat restrictions, they both require a lot of reports from multiple DIFFERENT players for the punishment to go through.\nWhat I'm trying to say is don't think you reported the player, that's going to be enough for punishment.

But so many players on this server believe that because there's no tribunal that there's no player behaviour moderation on this server whatsoever. There's know way to see a comprehensive list of punished players and we've never had the tribunal system here.\n\nI mean, disagree with me all you want but you actually have no clue how the system works. I'm not even the type of person to report people for every little thing - I report actual toxicity. When you report people sparingly like I do, the report holds more weight. From like 4000+ games I've maybe reported 200 people.

You don't have to be swearing or using specific words, the machine learning of the automated system means it's pretty good at picking up context, and at passing on cases it can't accurately assess for manual review.\n\nThat said, I agree with idiotic shell about the list idea. Having a comprehensive list of people who have banned will do more harm than good. It leads to witch hunts and breeds more negativity in the end. \n\nHOWEVER, you also have a very solid point about the transparency. We really do need more statistics regarding bans/punishments, because as you so accurately pointed out, there is an attitude of \"the system doesn't work I won't get banned\" even though that isn't the case, effectively nullifying the effect of the threat, and leading many players to actual punishments before they realise their mistake.\n\nThere are a couple statistics floating around that look like this:\n1. Only x% of players are ever permanently suspended.\n2. x% of punished players never see a second punishment.\n\nHowever I have misplaced my links for them so I'll have to reach out to some others for the specifics and get back to you.

The easiest way to get perspective on this is to actually mark each game you play with how many negative players are in each one. For the vast majority of those who say \"I have negative players in every single one of my games\", the reality is more like one negative player per 10~ games (if that).\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias\n\nWhat I mean by \"casual\" toxicity, is those one off occasions, where someone gets incredibly frustrated/tilted/offended and lashes out. While it doesn't occur often for that one player, over the entire population the average player is bound to encounter a decent number of these over a long play time. These are instances where a player is unlikely to get punished, but still usually ruins an experience for other players.\n\nAll I can really say is, most of those people who say \"the system doesn't work\" and are negative players themselves, find out that the system works very quickly. Most of the people who hold this opinion are those affected by the above two factors, and who are **usually** largely unaware of the inner workings of the system, i.e they expect more feedback or transparency when someone is punished, and assume that not getting it means there was no punishment, when it is simply (what I would consider) something that is lacking in the system and isn't indicative of the system's effectiveness with regards to actual punishments, only feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"Outis","date":"2016-11-23T12:05:34.031+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"depends what your definition of \"negative player\" is.\n\nin the context of this video game, i count \"negative player\" as anyone who afks/dcs (the reason for afk/dc is irrelevant), anyone who intentionally feeds, anyone who flames for no good reason (someone raging at a player intent feeding to me is 100% understandable), anyone who only plays for themselves and KDA and not for the team (this includes really stupid picks).\n\ni don't know what elo you play in but you're just taking the piss mate. in low elo (majority of playerbase) this shit happens a lot more frequently than you and your riot overlords keep claiming. it legitimately is close enough to being \"every game\" for people to be saying it.\n\n\"1 in 10 (if that)\" is a ridiculous claim. can't believe you actually think it happens in less than 10% of games. honestly it's starting to get insulting that you're claiming people are exaggerating by that much.\n","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-11-23T13:08:21.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Seras has just bought into riot's lies, especially since he took the position with riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-23T15:25:33.915+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"First of all, I have my disagreements with Riot, this particular issue is one of them.

It is my feeling that if they were negative enough to be restricted int he first place, then allowing them into a higher stakes environment is not the best idea. I feel it would be a good punishment and a good reward when you do finish your restriction, as well as the obvious benefit of protecting other players in said high stakes environment.\n\nThat said, I can also see Riot's stance of minimising negative reinforcement (as positive reinforcement does so much better) and leaving the player's behaviour and actions fully in the hands of the player where possible, thereby making it completely their choice whether to reform/recognise their behaviour or not.
