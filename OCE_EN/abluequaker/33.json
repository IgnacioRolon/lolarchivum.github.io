They aim to infrequently change prices, thus why they waited so long; they intend to match the long term trend of the fallen Aussie dollar.\n\nAs to your comment about ZERO reason; how on Earth do you know? While Riot itself is a billion dollar company Riot OCE is not a charitable handout to the OCE community, but a business in itself, that probably has to demonstrate to it's own feasibility. Any resources they need to buy come from the US and they are essentially paying more, any money they make looks like less to Riot NA due to our weaker dollar. \n\nWe have been getting cheaper RP for a year.\nThe prices are being adjusted to what they should be.\nYou can not say that Riot OCE are unjustified in doing this as you have no idea what their financial situation is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-03-08T15:14:30.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"people won't buy less.. when that new awesome skin comes out like the new sons, people will empty their wallets just to buy the bloody thing, they don't care about the price, they just want the skin","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wang Jouster","date":"2015-03-09T13:50:33.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The real reason is because LoL is now Halal certified (totally true, look it up)","replies":[]}]}
