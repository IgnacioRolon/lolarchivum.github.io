It uses the Australian one, more specifically in Australia we mostly use this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_Dictionary . So you're saying they should make one for every type of English? Lol..\n\n\n> Spelling and style\n> As in most English-speaking countries, there is no official governmental regulator or overseer of correct spelling and grammar. The Macquarie Dictionary is used by some universities and some other organisations as a standard for Australian English spelling. The Style Manual: For Authors, Editors and Printers, the Cambridge Guide to Australian English Usage and the Australian Guide to Legal Citation are prominent style guides.\n> \n> Australian spelling is closer to British than American spelling. As with British spelling, the u is retained in words such as colour, honour, labour and favour. While the Macquarie Dictionary lists the -our ending and follows it with the -or ending as an acceptable variant, the latter is rarely found in actual use today. Australian print media, including digital media, today strongly favour -our endings. A notable exception to this rule is the Australian Labor Party, which adopted the American spelling in 1912 as a result of -or spellings' comparative popularity at that time. Consistent with British spellings, -re, rather than -er, is the only listed variant in Australian dictionaries in words such as theatre, centre and manoeuvre. Unlike British English, which is split between -ise and -ize in words such as organise and realise, with -ize favoured by the Oxford English Dictionary and -ise listed as a variant, -ize is rare in Australian English and designated as a variant by the Macquarie Dictionary. Ae and oe are often maintained in words such as manoeuvre, paedophilia and foetus (excepting those listed below), however the Macquarie dictionary lists forms with e (e.g., pedophilia, fetus) as acceptable variants and notes a tendency within Australian English towards using only e. Individual words where the preferred spelling is listed by the Macquarie Dictionary as being different from the British spellings include \"program\" (in all contexts) as opposed to \"programme\", \"inquire\" and derivatives \"inquired\", \"inquiry\", etc. as opposed to \"enquire\" and derivatives, \"analog\" (as opposed to digital) as opposed to \"analogue\", \"livable\" as opposed to \"liveable\", \"guerilla\" as opposed to \"guerrilla\", \"yoghurt\" as opposed to \"yogurt\", \"verandah\" as opposed to \"veranda\", \"burqa\" as opposed to \"burka\", and \"pastie\" (food) as opposed to \"pasty\".[29][30][31] Unspaced prepositions such as \"onto\", \"anytime\", \"alright\" and \"anymore\" are also listed as being equally as acceptable as their spaced counterparts.[29][30][31]\n> \n> Different spellings have existed throughout Australia's history. A pamphlet entitled The So-Called \"American Spelling\", published in Sydney some time in the 19th century, argued that \"there is no valid etymological reason for the preservation of the u in such words as honor, labor, etc.\"[32] The pamphlet also claimed that \"the tendency of people in Australasia is to excise the u, and one of the Sydney morning papers habitually does this, while the other generally follows the older form.\" What are today regarded as American spellings were popular in Australia throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the Victorian Department of Education endorsing them into the 1970s and The Age newspaper until the 1990s. This influence can be seen in the spelling of the Australian Labor Party and also in some place names such as Victor Harbor. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary has been attributed with re-establishing the dominance of the British spellings in the 1920s and 1930s.[33] For a short time during the late 20th century, Harry Lindgren's 1969 spelling reform proposal (Spelling Reform 1 or SR1) gained some support in Australia: in 1975, the Australian Teachers' Federation adopted SR1 as a policy.[34] SR1 calls for the short /e/ sound (as in bet) to be spelt with E (for example friend→frend, head→hed).\n> \n> Both single and double quotation marks are in use (with double quotation marks being far more common in print media), with logical (as opposed to typesetter's) punctuation. Spaced and unspaced em-dashes remain in mainstream use, as with American and Canadian English. The DD/MM/YYYY date format is followed and the 12-hour clock is generally used in everyday life (as opposed to service, police, and airline applications).\n> \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_English#Spelling_and_style\n\nWe do have slight differences in spelling than British English and so does NZ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-03T06:45:22.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The more differences there are between two regional clients the more mistakes can be made and the the more they have to keep track of for updates.","replies":[]}]}
