OCE teams have trouble getting big sponsors to pay for things like houses and food because of various barriers like viewership numbers, time zones & geographical locations to name a few. If Chiefs have a great showing at IWCI & potentially MSI, then we may see a rise in the possibility of sponsors. Until we show we are good, we wont have the funding to train to be good. \n\nLets just hope Chiefs have a really good showing.","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2015-04-20T15:37:45.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair, our OCE teams are probably at the same level that the NA and EU teams were at the end of Season 2 and then they got the LCS in the next year.","replies":[]}]}]}
