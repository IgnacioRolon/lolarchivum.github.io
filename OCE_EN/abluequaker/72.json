It&#039;s Draft mode without Bans.\r\n\r\nWhat does it achieve?\r\n\r\n1.  No more having to call roles in champ select and deal with that one kid on a toaster who loaded in 15 seconds late and instalocks your role because &#039;they called 1st on their screen&#039;.\r\n2. No more mirror lanes.\r\n3. No more last- second &#039;oh shit we have 2 supports&#039; because nobody has called mid or support yet.\r\n4. No more first-timing a champion into their hardest counter. Everyone has experienced this and it sucks.\r\n\r\nI hate Blind pick and we&#039;re one of the few regions in the world that are subjected to the choice of &#039;Blind Pick or Ranked&#039;.","replies":[{"poster":"Smiol Wee","date":"2017-07-16T14:05:38.162+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just had one guy yell at me because I called jungle first but not on his screen, he copy/pasted what was there and when i did the same showing that I connected before him he then instalocked telling me how fake my paste was. I'm fine with dealing with the occasional random instalocker who then either forces someone else to give up their lane or causes you to pick a different lane. But what really gets to me is that you have to deal with it constantly, I just had this happen five games in a row and  and three of those times someone else dodged because of this. And when it comes down to it, if someone does this and you dodge because it either messes with the team comp or their griefing and threatening to feed and you don't want to deal with that, you then get punished and not them. Or you stay in the game and they either do horribly and flame the whole team which results in no punishment other than a loss (which effects the whole team) and some reports (which never results in anything, or at least not substantial enough to detour them). Or they do well and they don't get punished for it. It's a joke and riot haven't provided us with any means to deal with this. The only way to really ensure that this doesn't happen is to play with premades and wouldn't you know it, if you honour your premades it doesn't count for anything so it punishes you for playing with people who wont leave you with three seconds to spare wondering what to do because there's two junglers and someone who instalocked with teleport but you don't know where their going cause the champ works in a few lanes. \nMind you if its not blind-pick then only one person gets to practice a champ on one team, so I think if it were just blind-pick but you had to chose your roles like in ranked and what you've got is what you got.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-07-17T11:02:31.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you know me, you know how much I'm opposed to the \"calling lane in chat\" system.
