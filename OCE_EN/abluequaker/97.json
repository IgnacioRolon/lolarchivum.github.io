Everyone has bad games, including you. You can't say you've never fed before, everyone has. It's bad luck.\n\nIf people don't seem to take it as seriously as you, it's because *they* realise it's just a game. Because luck is involved, you're going to have bad and good games, but over the long-term average they even out to accurately describe your skill level. The 2 (out of hundreds) games you described lean more towards bad-luck games than good-luck. That's the life of a solo queuer. No amount of blaming is going to change that.","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2014-12-03T11:48:51.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The last time I 'fed' was yesterday as Wukong when I would ping a target, get an 'On My Way' ping from Yasuo who was meant to follow up my ult who then continuously backed off as I engaged and pursued a solo target (usually the enemy support or tank mao).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-03T00:46:20.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"cant 1 vs 5 as riven? dont deserve the win.","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2014-12-03T01:42:40.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exhaust, man. You can shut someone down with exhaust alone if they're the only damage source - especially if it's burst damage. I'll accept some blame, and I'll accept that some people just have bad games.
