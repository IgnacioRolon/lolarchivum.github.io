This allows conversations to be formed, with long discussions and disputes. \n\nBut on the NA boards alone, a post made 10 hours ago, will have over 200 comments, thousands of views and will be 3 pages down from the home page _(so no one will ever look at it again)_ also, often if a post isn't either funny, or hating on a champ. it wont get up votes. So the only things you ever see on the home page is some random's meme, or a whole lot of complaints. Neither of which are community-building. \n\nIf a post gets so many comments and are dropped off the home page (or never even reaches it) that quickly, its very difficult to have complex discussions, you have to trawl though 200 comments to find replies to yours.  I can only imagine how hectic the chinese/korean boards are. \n\nSo if all the servers shares the same boards/forums, it would be a machine gun of posts, before you had a chance to read all of them, new posts would already have taken their place, and you'd feel alone in a sea of players, rather than in a community with regular players that you know. \n\nNot to mention the language barriers as well. I remember being on the NA server before they made the mexican one, and the sheer hate 90% of the player base had for the mexicans, purely because they couldn't understand eachother was unreal _(its easy to see why trump got in, people in America are not empathetic.)_ imagine how bad it would be when Americans have to talk to Germans and Chinese and Russians, and no one around the world can understand the majority of the posts because they'd all be in different languages that don't relate at all to where you are in the world. \n\nNot to mention posts looking for teammates, teams, and sever specific events would die off completely. Especially for servers with small numbers like ours, the chances of actually finding another OCE person with a team that needs you, would be very small. \n\n----------\n\nAlso the idea of the internet isn't to bridge the gap between countries, its purpose was to be a place to easily and reliably store and access information, as well as a medium for quicker communication. It's only a side effect of the way we use the internet in modern day, that causes people from multiple cultures to come into contact with eachother more. \n\nSo while it sounds like a good and politically correct idea to have one global forum. The practicalities of it would soon put an end to it\nI can see where you're coming from though. \n\nAlthough theres nothing stopping NA and EU people from coming here and talking to us, and theres nothing stopping us from going and talking to NA.\nSome forums are region locked i believe, but probably because of population numbers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2017-03-13T02:01:57.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can post on NA boards with an OCE account, fyi","replies":[]},{"poster":"Corvo Attano","date":"2017-03-12T22:59:59.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i enjoy having the different forums mostly because you can meet people in Oce on these forums rather than having 20 people in the comments saying \"I can't add you for some reason\" on the NA Boards.","replies":[]}]}
