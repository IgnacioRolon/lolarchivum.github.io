RAF became pretty hard to do after the initial influx of people who started playing LoL. Not to mention RAF was never enabled on OCE up until a few months ago after all of my IRL friends had already started playing. The only way to get RAF rewards was by making smurfs, which is not what RAF was created to achieve and is what prompted the massive rework of RAF in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-08-11T20:45:16.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problems are\n\nwe all know the likelihood of those skins ever returning...\n\nalso the point of having only 5 friends needing to joint was to make it more worth your while to encourage friends to play rather than waste your time smurfing however friends are not made overnight and even if you do make a friend the chances of them being interested in games like lol are not 100% so these things take time, and time is the one thing they haven't given us.\n\nits almost childish, they put up the RAF late wait a few months and then \n\"nup.. no one is using it as quick as we wanted, so we're taking it away so no one can use it ever again\"\n\nall thats going to happen now is that the lower levels will be jam packed with smurfs for the next month as everyone who feels robbed by the fact that RAF came in late and is going away early.\n\ni usually support riot in my discussions but i think this was a bad move.","replies":[]}]}
