I'd ask people in my ranked team if they wanted to duo but they're rarely at home when I'm on LoL.\n\nEDIT: Just need ONE person I can trust to reduce the chance of getting that player that picks a FotM and feeds, or gets overconfident and throws, or is just blatantly rude.","replies":[{"poster":"iNoob","date":"2015-01-03T08:27:40.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"keep tilting rager toxic  bronze 5 gg afk surrender 20","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-01-02T11:22:08.972+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"looking for someone higher than me to carry me plz\"","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2015-01-02T13:25:38.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KingDinger,realm=OCE,application-id=mR0UmRrp,discussion-id=JYY3mgYE,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-01-02T11:22:08.972+0000)\n>\n> \"looking for someone higher than me to carry me plz\"\n\nNo, the title literally explains my situation.
