But I'm not tilting. I ward, I win lane, I roam when I need to, I gank when I need to, I teleport when I need to, I engage when I need to and I peel when I need to. Yet, somehow, I can't win. I always get that one person who isn't paying attention or gets over aggressive or is just careless and throws a winning match or loses it before we even get to mid game. I'm not tilting, I'm just really unlucky right now. And people are so extremely and consistently negative toward each other. I've now won something like 2 games out of about 10 and I'm more focused, playing better than, and being more friendly than every other player I encounter.\n\nI just went from Gold III 94LP to Gold IV after 3 days of this bullsh*t and I need to either stop playing Ranked and hope I get good teams when I start again, or find a duo partner that I can climb with. If I'd won my game back at Gold III 94LP I would have gone into promos with Plat IV MMR and most likely skipped Gold II if I was successful.\n\nWhat the hell is going on with this unnatural tilt?","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-12-07T01:18:56.133+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't play Ranked during the pre-season, a lot of people have some idiotic mentality that it doesn't matter if you win or lose, and that's right for people in Diamond as they cannot be placed in Diamond again for Season 5. Highest is Platinum 1. So essentially, what you're getting is people who mess around because they think theirs no consequences, and it'll bite them in Season when they place in Silver or Bronze from Gold. If you must play it, get a duo and just cheese botlane, as a good support and ADC can (and will) carry the match, it's why when you could see duos and that the enemy ADC and support were duo'd you had to shut them down.","replies":[{"poster":"Goldendo 2","date":"2014-12-08T11:28:48.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk, ive played ranked a lot during preseason and i havent seen much people \"giving up\" or \"not caring\" because the games \"dont matter\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Geldour","date":"2014-12-06T23:44:10.288+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i always take a 10min-30mins break if i lose 2 in a row, means that no one in the last game will be in your game and its like a fresh start","replies":[]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2014-12-06T21:47:12.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Big mistake playing ranked during preseason since that's when all the boosted kids start test driving their brand new accounts.","replies":[{"poster":"Hailwood","date":"2014-12-06T22:11:37.912+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you please explain how this works a bit more?\nBoosted how, and what are they testing?","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-12-06T23:43:13.650+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Before the season ends a bunch of people pay to have their account played by better people so that they can get to Gold or higher for the rewards.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Goldendo 2","date":"2014-12-08T11:29:42.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Big mistake playing ranked during preseason since that's when all the boosted kids start test driving their brand new accounts.\n\nWhy the hell would u get boosted in preseason?\n\nMost of the time the whole point of getting boosted is  - \n\n1.

If you did, losing 8 games wouldn't make you play with gold 5's.\n\nWhen I start losing, I usually stop playing ranked, play a few normals with a champion I know I can dominate with, and then just dominate ranked with that champion.
