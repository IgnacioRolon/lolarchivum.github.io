OCE's got multitudes of different cultures and languages and English is the dominant language here in OCE but it isn't as dominant here as it is in NA, which should be the case (personal opinion). \nMulticulturalism ftw. \nIf this server was aimed just to accommodate the English dominant countries in this area then it wouldn't be called OCE.

Secondly, reporting for a language barrier is false reporting, as long as they use pings the way they're meant to be use the person is still communicating.\n\nIf they're not using pings though, go ahead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Serfige","date":"2015-11-05T14:42:52.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NB7Jz27b7E","replies":[]}]}
