If it did, Platinum would be elo hell because players are both a) too arrogant and cocky to play as a team and b) players aren&#039;t bad enough to solo carry against.\n3. If Bronze was Elo Hell, then why did it take me a week to get my 2nd smurf account out of Bronze and a mere fortnight to get nearly every person I pre-make with out of Bronze?\n\nElo Hell is a myth perpetuated by people with the wrong mindset, lack of knowledge and lack of skill to climb. The only people who thoroughly believe they are in elo hell shouldn&#039;t really even be playing ranked for the sake of their teammates. If you&#039;re such a god at your role/champion and you&#039;re losing after stomping lane it&#039;s probably because you let the other lanes bleed out instead of transitioning into the next phase(s) of the game.\n\nYou need to check yourself. Get the right mindset, and then find like-minded friends to pre-make with. They don&#039;t even have to have good mechanics. Knowledge and game sense is more than enough to get you to gold.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-02-22T07:55:39.235+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or maybe you just hard carried every game like a plat smurf","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2016-02-24T05:33:59.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.gyazo.com/4767e9ae480830f9321b61c894c945ac.png\n\nThere's plenty of games where I did hard carry on things like Vi, Fizz and Yi but that right there is 5 Wins as Support in a row. I'll even admit that some games I did poorly in lane phase and play super safe so that other people could carry. A big difference between High and Low Elo is whether people 'bleed out'.\n\nE.g. A Diana was getting smashed by an Annie who eventually took over the game. The Diana, after 2 deaths and no items purchased, committed to getting Nashor's tooth when at any point she could have got a Catalyst/RoA and Abyssal and just held her own and still been relevant. And that Diana had something like 80k+ mastery.\n\nYou can be a god at a champion and never even get out of Bronze if you have a shit attitude and no common sense.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-02-22T09:01:04.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wait that makes Elo hell actually exist?\n\nWhile this post is useless (it's basically a known fact) it doesn't make it any less true.\n\nElo hell tends to be a mental state, or a simple fact of a person not admitting that they need to learn to play better.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jehovahs Witness","date":"2016-02-23T00:45:12.474+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bronze isn't ELO Hell.

'elo heaven' where someone consistently performs below par but manages to win more games than not because they get carried by teammates.\n\nthe thing is that people are usually more oblivious to the 'elo heaven' and take notice far more when they experience the 'elo hell'. ie. you never hear anyone post about winning/being promoted because they got carried but you do hear people complain about losing/being demoted even though they did well.\n\ntl;dr shit system. needs to be fixed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"aihggnbaiogweioa","date":"2016-02-22T14:04:04.701+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"here is an idea, every fucking person has their own elo hell, ever thought of that? ever person has a ranking that they cannot reach due to certain circumstances. sure, elo hell is temporary and once you get skilled enough you get out of it.... into the next one. here is a game: http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2104746640/226564070?tab=overview\nwho was the best player on the blue team? did he carry his teammates? yes. keep in mind that this is bronze 1 elo, now, did the jungler ignore the other lanes? no, just look at their assists, since he has the most kills. lets look at damage, did the damage dealers do their job? no. i firmly believe that elo hell exists, but the conditions are that it is temporary until you reach a certain skill point, and that it is the place where you are obviously better than your teammates but cannot carry them alone due to solo Que being unpredictable when matching people up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-02-22T06:32:31.793+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree i got my smurf from bronze to silver easy. 78% winrate on kha'zix and 100% winrate on urgod.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Michaeltk","date":"2016-02-25T21:10:07.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bronze is fun played one account that was b5 and not long it's silver now lol but the times were fun spent on it","replies":[]},{"poster":"jigglejigglwoosh","date":"2016-02-25T09:41:55.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my connection is elo hell","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mister Sun","date":"2016-02-24T05:16:11.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"BUMP","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-02-23T07:50:55.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lmao, whoever down voted \"bronze isn't elo hell\" and upvoted \n> Bronze isn't ELO Hell.
