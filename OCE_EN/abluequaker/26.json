Chiefs are having the same problem TSM did back in Season 2. Win everything domestic, then get flogged at everything international. We&#039;re sitting at the same point of development right now in OCE where teams are semi-pro and their players aren&#039;t fully invested in playing competitive LoL because there&#039;s no LCS format that FINANCIALLY supports that in OCE.","replies":[{"poster":"CptStupendous","date":"2015-09-07T05:13:39.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi there, Riot Stupendous checking in here. I head up esports in Oceania. I posted an update a month or so ago, you can read it [here](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/iFdEkXnp-riot-oce-update-and-qa?comment=0003).\n\nQuick question - when you ask for LCS what do you mean? Gaming houses? LAN games? Full time salaries?\n\nThere's a lot to consider when we think about growing esports in Oceania. The first thing I'll point out is that we're aiming for long term viability and sustainable success. We did a lot this year; went from three tournaments to three interconnected leagues, hosted a stadium event, started paying players, built a quality website and come November we're going to be hosting an international tournament. \n\nWe were all gutted to see the Chiefs lose in Turkey. They did considerably well considering all the other teams play in gaming houses. \n\nIt doesn't come down to the size of the region or the cost, although as with anything there's always a finite amount of resources. It's critical that we get the basics right and grow from there, rather than rush into a structure which will hurt us in years to come.","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2015-09-08T08:14:29.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who watched the NA and EU scene grow, and then in turn continued watched those scenes since the early days of LCS, I just get upset when I see such minimal attempts to publicize the OCE competitive scene internationally.\n\nForget LCS for the moment, OPL isn't even advertised on the main LoL Esports website. Meanwhile, several LoL regions that aren't even owned or operated by Riot are permanently publicized on the LoL Esports site with game times, statistics, leaderboards and what not.\n\nI'd say a good start would be to have all competitive scenes that have English commentary available, publicized and aired on LoL Esports - even if that means making another section dedicated to Developing Regions. Then eventually, when Riot considers the OCE scene to be strong enough, move it to a full LCS format competition with 2 splits, gaming houses and player salaries. Otherwise we'll continue to have semi-pro teams filled with part-time players indefinitely.\n\nIn my honest opinion, the OCE competitive scene _really_ isn't that far off where NA and EU were in Season 2 (the season prior to the commencement of the LCS).\n\nLast time I checked, Japan has a full-on league & gaming houses and they don't even have a server yet.\n\nI wouldn't even mind watching VODs over Live Streams for a couple of splits if it meant that our games were being Live Streamed in NA and EU on LoL Esports because, frankly, the international fan-base is much larger than the domestic one.","replies":[{"poster":"CptStupendous","date":"2015-09-08T20:48:24.017+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is a great discussion to have, so thanks again for bringing this up.\n\nProfessional clubs are definitely the end goal. What do I mean by clubs? Well a club would have the following attributes as a minimum; financially stable, strong brand, fans/followers and be content creators. It would be up to each club to decide if they have gaming houses, that's up to them. If you look at other sports, the clubs drive engagement as much as the league itself. \n\nExposure on lolesports is probably something we could use more, but it's not going to be a magic bullet. We  promote Oceanic esports through the Oceanic client which is the most effective way to meet players. Our role here is to create esports content that Oceanic players engage with, that appeals to you locally and you find rewarding to spend your time on. \n\nGrowth and progress was good this year, and you'll see progress next year. However, we're not going to catch up to the other regions by doing the same things they did at a smaller scale. We need to adapt what NA/EU have done to something that's more appealing to the Oceanic fans. We need to be creative and really create something unique to Oceania. That's our challenge :-)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Autismo Extremo","date":"2015-09-06T15:14:36.025+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"we're bound to always be a bunch of shitlords get used to it","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-10-04T04:24:44.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lolx","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Strat","date":"2015-09-06T13:02:24.426+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Rito's said it before, OPL doesn't have enough support to financially justify a real LCS. We're 1/10 of the size of NA/EU. Also, comparing Chiefs to TSM in Season 2 is laughable - Chiefs are nowhere near the level of even the old TSM before they got their gaming house.\n\nThe best we could hope for is for Riot to sponsor the top OCE team to compete in the NA challenger series. That'd be interesting, in a way.","replies":[]}]}
