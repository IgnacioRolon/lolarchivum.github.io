Now I need to decide whether I want to keep climbing or play casually.\n\nEDIT: Also, any Rioter who sees this please take a look at the chat log from my first promo game and swiftly remove that disgusting Ezreal from the LoL community. It's a blatant, ban-worthy offence.","replies":[{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-03-03T10:45:33.034+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"enjoy it old man, for it shall be your last","replies":[]},{"poster":"XSirCution","date":"2015-03-03T10:27:41.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8zMyLsVqZ8\n\nits up to u if u wanna climb","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2015-03-03T11:09:10.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's Plat on EUW - arguably the most toxic server for Solo Q (even several EU CS and LCS players have had bans/suspensions from both competitive and general play as well as fines).
