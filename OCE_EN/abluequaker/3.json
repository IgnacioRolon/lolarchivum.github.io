Riot and the likes of Garena do their best to make severs locally available to players in as much of the world as possible.\n\nIf you live in New Zealand or Australia and you know enough basic English to get by in a game of LoL USE IT. It's just rude to never ping and then start talking in a non-supported language.\n\nAt least use pinyin or its equivalent so that it's not just a mass of foreign characters.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-05-29T03:45:15.231+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I agree that, since most people on the server speak english, people playing on the server should learn enough basic english for the purpose of champion select and be able to use pings effectively in-game, reporting someone for \"refusing to communicate\" doesn't cover \"language barriers\" as stated on the \"Reporting a Player\" page of the support section of the website, and I quote, \"**Refusing to Communicate with Team** - This applies to any Summoner that refuses to use chat or pings. *Please note that this is **not** meant to be used in cases of language barrier!*\"\nSource: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-05-28T13:57:59.008+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meh English speakers who are living in other regions don't go around learning the native's language most of the time anyway.\n\nBut they all want others to learn English.\n\nFor the most part, the reason why they would wanna type in their first language is generally associating with them playing together with buddies. A better communication between 2+ people, using the language they're familiar with, is definitely better than communicating with everyone through a subpar display of second language that may end up with nobody understanding anything.\n\nIf they're using pings correctly I fail to see why you would wanna report them for refuse to communicate, it's not like the chat box is something that is ever used by anyone to enhance the strategic significance in solo queue anyway, at least generally.\n\nEDIT: I do agree that if someone is playing all the way from across the sea for whatever reason, it's really better for them to just stick with their own server, or at least the one that is closest to them.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-28T18:04:22.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Meh English speakers who are living in other regions don't go around learning the native's language most of the time anyway.\n\nBut very few places don't have people that speak English.\n\nAlso saying all English speakers don't is actually racist.\n\nFact is if we all spoke 1 language it would be easier.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-05-29T03:30:26.385+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=d6weWuhO,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-05-28T18:04:22.961+0000)\n>\n> But very few places don't have people that speak English.\n> \n> Also saying all English speakers don't is actually racist.\n> \n> Fact is if we all spoke 1 language it would be easier.\n\nNah I didn't generalise everyone hence I said \"most of the time\".\n\nThe reason why not many people don't at least have a basic comprehension of English (not just Aus, globally) is not because everyone wants to, but forced to due to economical pressures.

FFS if they are playing well, using pings and if they aren't AFK or feeding you should be happy. Some players don't talk at all, do you report them for 'refusing to communicate? They were communicating, you were just frustrated that you couldn't understand them. \n\nYou should be the one making the effort mate, to accept others and their cultures within the OCE.
