You get to the last couple of levels, start to lose, and you wonder what&#039;s happening - why it suddenly got so hard.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that at least one person built like garbage. Your Tank/Mage didn&#039;t cap their CDR so they can&#039;t rotate their CC enough to deal with the Kog&#039;maws. Your MF built a BT in spite of the fact that Lifesteal is reduced by 40%.\n\nList the most optimal builds you&#039;ve tried or seen so hopefully these players see this thread and stop throwing our games.\n\nIT&#039;S REALLY NOT THAT HARD TO FINISH ONSLAUGHT.

Don't build selfishly.","replies":[{"poster":"oNIELy","date":"2017-09-12T06:44:53.515+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"adc - {{item:3153}} {{item:3091}} {{item:3124}}","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-09-12T07:23:54.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I usually add a giant slayer to that, gives an extra 10% damage against pretty much everything you hit, other than the \"voidlings\". It means you don't have gold to upgrade boots, but I've found it to be really effective.\n\nAlternatively, you could go for a more \"crit\" based build (best on MF, in my experience), using BotRK, Infinity Edge, Static Shiv (or really anything that builds from Zeal, depending on what you need) and Berserker's greaves.","replies":[]}]}]}
