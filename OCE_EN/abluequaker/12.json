File check. It needs to make sure that all necessary Direct X versions have been installed and that the game files are complete and not corrupted.\n\n2. System check. It needs to make sure players aren&#039;t going to be loading into games with their shitty school laptops at 15 FPS.\n\n3. Ping check. It needs to make sure people aren&#039;t going to start complaining about lag before minions even spawn.\n\nIf Riot really wants to not be at fault when people disconnects and loses several innocent players a 40+ minute Ranked match, a system at least somewhat resembling this needs to be implemented. Until then, Riot can start giving people Loss Forgiven every time some ignorant twat DCs from a Ranked match because they don't have the moral conscience to check their ping to make sure they&#039;re not going to be a burden to 4 other people.","replies":[{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-05-16T09:26:35.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the ping check,\n\nWindows\n1.
