However, I don't want it like CoD with how any random in the game can just sit there and flame. Maybe restrict it to people on your friends list? idk, I just feel that voice is needed to communicate effectively sometimes. Yeah pings work fine but you can only communicate to an extent on what is going to happen, and typing takes way too long.","replies":[{"poster":"Blumpkin","date":"2015-05-28T09:29:57.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol it is pretty easy to counter people that flame, it's called a mute button works wonders and is quite simple to use and understand","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-05-28T10:31:44.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I do use it, but I yearn for the day there is no need for it :/","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MasterMirkinen","date":"2015-05-25T03:18:10.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A Blue Quaker,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=GTfOg3in,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-05-24T08:57:25.607+0000)\n>\n> As first you were against CV because it provided jungle timers.

Riot doesn't want voice chat because it's harder to moderate and could potentially breed toxicity, 2. 3rd party software is fine.\n\nThing is, though, 3rd party software is useless if nobody knows about it. CV was quite popular for a time, and now nobody uses it because news spread that it would get you banned - and it could for a time. Rito changed their policy when Timers were removed from the app, but they never made  that information widely available but, say, posting a statement on the main page would have been a good solution.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-24T21:50:35.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A post from one of the Rioters a while ago on the topic of voice chat involved \"no related project for now\" and, in case it was to be done, \"limited to people on your friendlist\".\nSo while there's no one working on it, they seem to have an idea of some boundaries to apply to eventual future related projects.\n\nFrankly, i'd appreciate if voice chat didn't include randoms.
