And I can guarantee the game 90% of people are crying about not getting an S in was probably a f*cking Normal too.\n\nIf I had it my way, Champion Mastery would be a hell of a lot harder. If I had it my way even me, who has 3 Level 7 Champions and averages an S- on them, wouldn&#039;t even be eligible to try to unlock Mastery Rank 6 &amp; 7.\n\nIf I had it my way, there would be a Mastery Rank 8 that you had to earn in Ranked, and then re-earn every time you got to a new tier (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, etc) and then your Champion Mastery would actually indicate that you&#039;re a Bronze Level Yasuo main, or a Challenger Yasuo main. Because, believe me, Quantity =/= Quality. A Bronze 500k Mastery Yasuo is garbage next to a Challenger Yasuo with 50k Mastery. In fact, it&#039;s a testament to how bad you actually are at that champion if you&#039;ve played 500k Mastery-worth of games and you&#039;re still Bronze.\n\nThe next time I see a thread complaining about how they didn't get an S I'm going to give myself a bloody hernia yelling so hard.","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-05-31T09:17:06.324+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ranking system doesn't really mean you played well though\n\nIt takes a statistical score and compares it to other people's on the same champion.

But as it stands, Assassin mains have to play assassins at a higher standard to get an S, than support mains need to play support, and this isn't fair.\n\nHere is a picture to illustrate my point:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gsr3c5c\n\nIn pic 1, Vi clearly does better than me, in every single way, even with counting the leniency towards supports she still played better than me. Yet she gets ranked 2 whole tiers below me, which isn't fair as she clearly played far far better than me.\n\nIn pic 2, Both Anivia and Ashe played better than me (lets be honest, my score is pretty damn average for a supp here) and somehow i get an S+, anivia only gets an S- and Ashe (who got the best score of everyone) got nothing at all.\n\nSo either: its too easy to get an S with supports, OR its too hard to get one with ADC/Assassins. I have no idea which one it is, but it should be standardised, it should require the same level of skill to get an S with an assassin, as it does to get an S with a support.","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2016-05-30T23:27:32.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do remember.

Also supports and tanks are not any easier, you're just judging on kda.  Even an average player playing an average game will get a lot of kills  on an assassin. What really defined skill here is how _affective_ those kills are. Jumping their 0/9/0 botlane for a cool 100g in kill gold is a bit different from counterganking their mid/jungle then puhsing mid and taking a drag to boot. \n\nSupport on the other hand are rarely going to get a load of kills and a measure of their skill is going to be much more closely based on how many assists they have, how few deaths they and their lane partner have and their lane partner's cs. Perhaps you find it easy to get high raking because your builds are toplane-like and have high kill potential and as a  support kills are much rarer and so boost your mastery. I mean seriously, steraks on a support leona lmao. You're either building it early and risking the game for a bit of damage/kills or building it late at which point you;re better off building somethign else. \n\nActually not a bad idea if you wanted to farm high ranks on your supports would be to go that high risk build. You'd likely lose a few extra games than normal but the ones wwhere you win would probably have a high percentage of s ranks.

Again, i played Xin in almost every role for a day except ADC pushing my T6, i did T7 entirely from Top/JG, Top Xin is the hardest mastery to achieve s constantly in, thus almost any champ with a gap closing ability and bit of burst who usually sits in top/jg... is viable in Mid normals to gain an S rank, also your champ is probably so underplayed in other roles, getting that top 5% in the field, is relatively easy. Also, Xin vs champs like, Zed, Fizz, Talon... in mid... you became a counter to an assassin who was countering a likely AP in mid... Again, very easy, the skill level isnt the same, just the first 10mins of mechanics are different. \n\n3) Contributions, each role has a different weight in how they contribute in team fights, turret damage, dragon/baron going outside your role and roaming around 10min mark due to smart warding to shut down enemy jg, control objectives, gain CS etc is vital, you only need around 80cs at 30mins for support, 80-100cs around 25mins for JG, at 25mins top and adc should have 125+ mid should be minimum of 100+ by 15mins with at least a couple of assists either from JG ganking,  or roaming to gank top/bot. \n\n4) If you're not JG for your team, enemy JG monsters are valuable in CS as it locks in you're in enemy JG, killing the large monster which you're not itemed for, once again, a harder ting to do, we all know once you have a completed dmg item or tank item, virtually any champ can start clearing jg... its not your focus, but dont feel shy about taking out enemy krugs or toad when its next to your lane and just sitting there. \n\n5) Wards / Oracles- Support have access to Oracles Elixer, JG has to use smite on raptors to gain this effect, and you need an oracles alteration as top/supp to help your rank with clearing wards as removing vision is actually important. All lanes / positions should try to ward areas of enemy jg around the 1min50second mark in prediction for Blue/Red jgler being alone, taking damage and his leashers running back to lane to not miss cs... he's gankable. Your ward granting vision of this also adds to mastery. If you're top lane from the top side, ward the bottom blue, if your bottom and adc/supp, try to invade through middle river, not through dragon ramp, but the brush along the side from mid, and ward blue, again... JG is going to be smacking that buff'd monster with no Smite available and will most likely burn Flash and will base putting him behind, you can be certain in almost 60seconds from that flash, he'll be back for wolves or raptor to continue, in approx 90sec, he'll be at the opposite buff, again, an early gank weighs heavily on skill factor and mastery. \n\nDamage outputs, if your role is top/mid/adc your damage output to champs is vital, whilst maintaining cs, its great you got 20-0-0 but if you roamed all game without controlling lane or helping with objectives, no S rank for you, just a simple A+. Great work, not exceptional, whilst the mastery system does not equate \"sharing farm\" evenly so not snowball too hard yourself and setting your team up for a massive counter if you get caught out and feed the enemy but your team is relatively average cs without positive KDAs, if you can grab something with only a minor delay in pushing etc, all the better...\n\nTimers on when objectives are completed, pushing your first turret asap also adds more mastery than dropping your lane turret at 20mins, wether you killed a champ or fed or not, there's alot of points there, great points if you can do it by 10mins, 15mins for the 2nd. You will notice pushing early objectives creates massive team farm and with the game now working in \"Sections\" early/mid/late effectively, keeping combat time up and doing objectives is key to gaining the most from your early game, \n\nregarding normals, you do not want a 45min game ever, the quicker the game, better the mastery, high cs and kills with low timer and a FF at 20 or a nexus kill by 25mins, is better than a 15-3 game that lasts 45mins as you're only getting 1 kill every 3mins, not so fancy now eh? \n\n\nSo top cap off, if you ever get asked \"dont surrender\" you know, even if you're going to lose... don't surrender, that baby who thinks farming kills slowly coz he's snowballed will get him S or better, in fact that guy will only get a B+ or so, you took 45mins when you can 3shot any champ within 1-2seconds? Poor form.\n\nLastly... \n\nITEMS!!! ITEMS ITEMS ITEMS!!!!\n\nusing a flask adds a little extra mastery, even if you're full build coz you snowballed, start swapping your early dominance items for late game items, no doubt you'll have more hp, armor/mr to deal with, and you've got no way to take a punch in a team fight, start swapping items around, ive had s+ 30+kda's with Xin, but instead of Boots+5items, ive dropped boots for a 6th item and sold early game dmg items like Ghostblade for more sustained armor pen like Black Cleaver, switched out my novelty 5th dps from Duskblade (nightfall proc) to having a Guardians or Zz'Rots portal to keep side lane pressure up, all whilst letting me live to a 3rd round of CD's in a fight, rather than finishing within 1 combo burst, and cleaning up with the 2nd.\n\n\nAll these little things factor in, just because you the player feel like you're special in the game, doesn't mean you the master were all that masterful when compared to other players of the champ and the output that Riot is collecting in data and comparing you too. \n\nAnd no t7 is not really \"skill\" you can spam different lanes for different curves, spend some cash opening chests, get your blue essence and done. What i do like seeing is a) highly used champs with T7, Xin, Zeds, Luciens, Caitlyns, etc who are cheap, in style, using their strongest lane and perform consistantly, this does not mean every game is an S game, regardless of Original Poster trying to claim constant S games, we all go through phases, there will be games because of the amstery, we'll get focused to get shut down, early achievers of mastered champs i give some credit to having skill with, but when your champ is viable as a support.... even barely viable, as long as it has a way to contribute, tanking, supporting ADC, bursting with ADC as a support... It's almost too easy to just take a supp slot in normals for 70% of the champs, nobody uses them in supp, they've got no data pool of players to rank you against, you'll likely get S- or better on a subpar game if you took those stats and used them as the top lane mastery curve, s- for supp, if you went top you'd have gotten a B- or C+... Skill? or just aware of mechanics?\n\nRiot says that this system isn't abusable. It really is, and i just shown every OCE normal player how to do it, considering alot will buy RP to get their blue essence, i doubt riot will care too much that i just ruined the mastery system.","replies":[{"poster":"AshenOCE","date":"2016-06-02T23:34:25.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ToTaL ViRGiN,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=6PTs1wUy,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-05-31T02:44:05.377+0000)\n>\n> Errr you forgot the number one problem, t7 isnt really indicative of skill on alot of champs either, i can do support malphite for constant S or better games in support, yet a top lane malph the curve is harder. \n> \n> Also mechanics on where your role is is based off 5 things i&#x27;ve noticed;\n> \n> 1) your summoner spell, if you have smite and do not go from nexus through a lane to the final turret, you have secured the JG bell curve, it is possible to &quot;cheat&quot; the system by starting with TP, going into the ADC lane with an ADC, locking in all 3 turrets, your ADC gets the ADC due to being ranged, usually having heal thus you get the support role, support can roam into top lane and trigger all 3 turrets, yet as soon as you both do this, you can switch lanes securing your mastery curve in the supp role, which champs which are not supports, have a very easy mode in getting the S+ curve, hell when the T6/7 curve came out, i dont deny i had the first 36h of constant &quot;top&quot; lockins, i just ended up getting 2 of my tokens as support Xin Zhao, whilst doing the support function, letting my adc farm, i gained my minimum through a relic shield, and progressed into DMG anyways, only difference was, no dorans blade due to not being top, ends up being the t2 relic before face of the mountain, is actually a decent way to instantly drop a wave as support xin, remove the minion threat, be in an enemy champs face with your triple hit wombo combo, you still do solid dmg, and your adc gets a free CC and burst dmg before starting... similar idea to alot of mid mages going bot as support for an easier curve\n> \n> 2) turrets actually lock in your role, prior to mastery 6 and 7 i have never noticed turrets glowing as you walk past at the start, im pretty certain this dictates from the start, where your being ranked against.
