I main AD Carry and Top and am really versatile in what I can play in each position. Age 18+ is preferred (for the sake of maturity and, by extension, the preservation of my brain cells) and TeamSpeak 3 or Curse Voice for comms.\n\nEDIT: Just add me in-game. I'll be on tomorrow. Right now I need to finish a university assignment. But yeah, basically my idea behind this is purely to find a trustworthy duo partner so there's one less potentially autistic player on my team in ranked because I'm utterly sick of people ruining game after game.","replies":[{"poster":"Strat","date":"2014-12-06T10:46:56.802+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was with you until I saw:\n\n>so there's one less potentially autistic player on my team in ranked because I'm utterly sick of people ruining game after game.\n\nHave you considered that you might be part of the problem in these games? I have no interest in duoing with someone who's negative like this from the get go, and I advise anyone else reading this thread not to duo with this player.","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2014-12-06T11:48:10.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Unless I'm talking to a Duo partner, I give the basic run-down of how I want to play the early game (e.g. 'camp X champion' or 'play safe we have late game') and how we should team fight (e.g. I'll engage first in fights then focus X then Y champions and take an objective). Other than that I am perfectly quiet and just ping.\n\nAnd I am sick of getting 1 ridiculously bad player or 1 annoying abuse player who throws game after precious game. I was on 94 LP a couple of Days ago with a 59% Win Rate and now I'm literally having the worst luck game after game getting abusive or careless players. So either I give up on ranked until the school holidays are over and the influx of casual players with a lot more time on their hands are back in class, or I find a good duo partner to help my odds.\n\n\nEDIT: I like to think I'm justifiably mad. I really need to take a chill pill, though. And I edited in the part that you quoted right after my I had a team surrender right as we were starting to make a comeback. I legit won lane as Wukong as Riven AND I ACCIDENTALLY STARTED WITH DORAN'S RING. xD","replies":[{"poster":"Goldendo 2","date":"2014-12-08T11:06:07.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If u find yourself getting angry in game, its not gonna help climbing.
