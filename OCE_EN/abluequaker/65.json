The last person to report the player will get a notification of said summoner, not everyone who has will.\n\nIf you do encounter them again, and they are still very toxic, report them again. Reports do stack up over time, and though it generally doesn't stop the creation of a new account, it does make the player remake and level a new account, which can be frustrating.\n\nHope this helps :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-09-27T12:52:56.332+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The boards isn't the place to do this\nTry here my friend ----> https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2016-09-28T03:16:44.698+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really care if they actually see this.
