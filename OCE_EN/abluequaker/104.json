This was intended for champion mains and players with off-meta builds that relied on their pre-existing skillset. Unfortunately, players caught on and started using gameplay updates as an opportunity to get some free RP from content that they don&#039;t use very much. With so many people using it, and for the wrong reasons, Riot decided to stop allowing content refunds for all players - a blanket ban.\r\n\r\nFast-forward to now. Fizz was my most-played Champion across all of my accounts in Season 6. I used a weird AP Bruiser Fizz build with Rylai&#039;s and Gunblade. It wasn&#039;t meta, but it worked for me and it helped me climb. It also does not work (full stop) with the new Fizz.\r\n\r\nI sent in a ticket to Riot asking for a content refund. I acknowledged that I knew why Riot no longer allowed them, but explained that I fit the criteria for players that should actually still be able to get content refunds for gameplay updates.\r\n\r\nThey basically just told me to go away because there was nothing they could do.\r\n\r\nPLEASE RIOT. Let players actually affected by VGUs to be able to get content refunds. I refuse to play Fizz in his current state. He&#039;s about as gimmicky as Shaco, and scales worse than him.","replies":[{"poster":"Vhaegor","date":"2016-12-16T12:32:18.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They barely changed Fizz, what are you talking about.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BRUSHED","date":"2016-12-14T06:52:49.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it happened to me with vlad. i used to do this wierd sunfire cape build that allowed me to farm so quickly and safely in lane that at 15 mins id usually have 300 cs with no sweat. the new vlad had his e changed which was what the build used majorty of the time. now im stuck with a mastery 7 vlad that im absolutly shit with. id take a refund for my vlad items if offered as i have no use for him anymore.\n\nside note: i had a mastery 5 on yorick before his change. the new yorick is actually better for me lol.\nbut no i feel your pain dude","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2016-12-14T07:13:18.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, unless you're proxying 2 waves inside the enemy base your maximum cs in lane @ 15 minutes can only be 174.
