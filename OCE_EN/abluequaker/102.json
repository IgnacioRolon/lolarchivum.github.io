It absolutely gives the impression that the system isn't working/they haven't reformed (hopefully the latter is the case).\nIf they are repeatedly showing the same toxic behaviour, the system should definitely pick them up. If they were punished and still haven't reformed, they will face harsher punishments - you can read more about the scaling punishments [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Boqd81O0-upcoming-upgrades-to-chat-restrictions). It's worth mentioning that it's ineffective to ask Rioters on the forums to check your reports, if you are seriously concerned that something has gone wrong with your report, you can open a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/). \n\nI hope that helps - it's just a fair bit of bad luck on your part that you had to deal with them again!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-10-23T10:16:15.633+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They still should be banned even from that single game, intentional feeding is a high priority and is definitely not tolerated","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Groggo","date":"2016-10-27T09:25:24.230+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah its alright to let players like this keep playing, each time their punishment is escalated, but what about the minimum 9 people that this 1 player ruins the game for? 9 people who actually want to play the game properly and win games?? priorities for riot are screwed its disappointing","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-10-27T23:41:21.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"On the one hand, Riot can do what they're doing, give people chances to reform, avoid punishing people because of one mistake or circumstances out of their control and people just have to occasionally deal with the toxic player(s). On the other hand, Riot can crack down hard, ban people for first offences, perma-ban for second/third, forget about giving *anyone* the chance to reform and end up with no one playing because they've all been banned (most of them because of one mistake or circumstances out of their control).\n\nTake your pick.","replies":[{"poster":"Outis","date":"2016-11-21T09:09:23.465+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"riot already hands out insta-2 week bans for making 1 mistake for certain things. they are very inconsistent.\n\n\ne.g i used the word '%%%got' once, and only once, in the history of my level 7 account. 2 week ban. no prior punishments.\n\nok fine, but why did the person that was intentionally ruining the game (the reason i used that word) not receive the same kind of ban? why does it take a long documented case of them consistently behaving like this to receive one when it took me only 1 match?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-11-21T09:34:03.858+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry, Heartvine kisses ass and doesn't look to see what riot actually does, or in this case, doesn't do.\n\nRiot has a massive history of only LOOKING like they give a shit, while not actually doing anything to stop this behaviour.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-11-21T00:47:10.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"on this topic, how about a report forum for the aram bots","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-10-30T04:36:32.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I noticed that someone started recording the game on op.gg after the 20 minute mark.

Unfortunately for them, they only hit two of the ult shots before Hecarim's fear fucked him right up.
