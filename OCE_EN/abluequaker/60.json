And god forbid an AD Carry actually has the ability to outplay some of the braindead carry-killers. Bang bang.

They hard carry, because they actually understand engagement zones and so do their team mates, they don't even have to be 10/0, 3-5/0 will usually suffice. All that you are proving is it's hard to carry as a 10/0 adc in lower elos.","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2016-02-14T09:08:14.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This thing is, though, I'm saying this from the perspective on someone who plays Tanks and plays Assassins for the most part.
