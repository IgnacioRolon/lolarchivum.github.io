When you can refund the time of your life that you spent using those skins before the sale, then I'll support a refund of your RP","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2015-11-15T22:42:35.097+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"why would they? that's retarded. you know about the sale, so you either pay full price and get it on release, or wait the short amount of time until it goes on sale and buy it then. you don't get the best of both worlds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Qweeeeerty","date":"2015-11-16T07:08:31.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP this is like saying that you went and purchased a meal on a regular night and get a chicken schnitzel compared to waiting till it's snitty night at the same place.\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \n\nYou pay full price when the skin comes out because you enjoy it and you like it, not to just go in a years time oh I want my RP back now I'm over it.

I bought GotS Skarner for 975RP, knowing it would be half price in a years time and didn't care. Now it going on sale for 750RP, so... get 225RP refunded? Wow that's something worth fighting for.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-11-15T22:51:42.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol.","replies":[]}]}
