It doesn't need admin rights to do that.\n\nAlso, how did that happen? Are you going to put anything in place to prevent it from happening again?","replies":[{"poster":"my name is jefff","date":"2015-01-19T04:31:51.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well what really happened is my dad uninstalled all my games :( heaven knows why, then i tried to reinstall it but i cant because i dont know the admin password so what i did is i asked my friend to send me the Config, Logs, and RADS files. he couldn't send the RADS files because it's too big so what i did is i downloaded this http://www.fileplanet.com/204655/200000/fileinfo/League-of-Legends-Client-%28Free-Game%29 and everytime i try to launch lol.launcher.exe it says 'unspecified error occured.

And that's not how programs work. Only a program that's specifically marked as 'portable' is guaranteed to run from just opening the .exe file. All other programs need to be installed via their installer, so that they can be written into the registry on your computer and have the appropriate files added to your \"Users\" folder and the appropriate dependencies installed.\n\nIn other words, use the installer to install things.\n\nAnd I would stay far away from going to free file servers to get something like this. That's the easiest way to give your computer a virus or other malicious software (they are not regulated in any way). Also, I'm pretty sure it's against the EULA to post links like that here.\n\nIf your Dad uninstalled all the games off his computer without telling you, then you should have a talk with him about it. Ask him why, and if he can let you reinstall it. I wouldn't install a game on his computer without his permission.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
