But what I noticed was, when i click on the match history it&#039;s saying that my IGN is BenGGi with two G&#039;s and that the people i&#039;m vsing IGNs aren&#039;t found in the OCE server.\r\n\r\nI then logged on the next day, and there was 6 more games from BenGGi vsing other people that aren&#039;t actually on OCE. \r\nI turned to OP.GG and search the NA IGN BenGGi and all their games are showing up in my match history ?? \r\n\r\nNothings changed stat wise, my LP hasn&#039;t changed nor my win/loss but the matches are showing up in my history.\r\n\r\nPlease explain.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-09-27T05:32:30.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThis is definitely weird.\n\nI've gone ahead and forwarded this issue onto the appropriate people and it is currently being looked in to.","replies":[{"poster":"Bengi","date":"2016-09-27T08:05:18.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, definitely gave me a fright when I first noticed it.
