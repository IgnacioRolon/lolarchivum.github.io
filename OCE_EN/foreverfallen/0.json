Also last night had a stream of toxicity from mid laner which explains the losing streak - I play with gold/plat people daily so that shouldn't be an issue. I main Janna/Nami/Thresh/Leona/Blitscrank/Nautilus do essentially any support haha, let me know here as I'm not at home atm so can't check requests etc.","replies":[]}]}
