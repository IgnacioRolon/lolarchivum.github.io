It seems that I may have deleted my new one. \r\n\r\nI think I have deleted the wrong account. I currently own two accounts called catharry and YOYOITSTHEYOY0 (OCE ENGLISH). I meant to delete my catharry account, but it seems I might have accidentally deleted my YOYOITSTHEYOY0 account. I logged into catharry on this website and put up a ticket requesting a delete. I then logged into YOYOITSTHEYOY0 because I could not log into it. I had to verify my email. After doing so, I checked this support section. I went down to MY TICKETS and clicked on it. It said one of my tickets was the one I made on the catharry account. I then replied to the ticket on YOYOITSTHEYOY0, and went to the catharry account. It said catharry had wrote the comment YOYOITSTHEYOY0. I don't understand what happened. I'd like neither the accounts deleted now.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2020-02-25T14:39:51.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As per the [Account Deletion FAQ](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202647784-Account-Deletion-FAQ) on the Support Site, the deletion process begins 30 days after the request has been received. During that time, you'll have the option to change your mind, in which case you'll want to respond to the ticket **as quickly as possible** to confirm that you *don't* want the account deleted, though that change *may* not be possible to process if it is within 5 days of the deletion process start date.","replies":[]}]}
