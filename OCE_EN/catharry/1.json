Anyone could give me confirmation that I didn't?\r\n\r\nI think I have deleted the wrong account. I currently own two accounts called catharry and YOYOITSTHEYOY0 (OCE ENGLISH). I meant to delete my catharry account, but it seems I might have accidentally deleted my YOYOITSTHEYOY0 account. I logged into catharry on this website and put up a ticket requesting a delete. I then logged into YOYOITSTHEYOY0 because I could not log into it. I had to verify my email. After doing so, I checked the support section. I went down to MY TICKETS and clicked on it. It said one of my tickets was the one I made on the catharry account. I then replied to the ticket on YOYOITSTHEYOY0, and went to the catharry account. It said catharry had wrote the comment YOYOITSTHEYOY0. I don't understand what happened. I'd like neither the accounts deleted now.","replies":[]}
