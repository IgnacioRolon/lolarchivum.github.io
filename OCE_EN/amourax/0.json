I really want to know because i want to book some tickets before all the seats go and if the cup is a collectible one i will get buy a combo and if it isnt i will just buy a ticket. I don&#039;t want to get the Lol Combo and waste $15 if it doesnt have  a nice Lol collectible. So if someone could get back to me on this , asap would be greatly appreciated!!!\r\n\r\nCheers!","replies":[{"poster":"GeneralCoxy","date":"2015-09-09T08:22:13.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, presently this is an OPL LoL cup and we are trying to work with Coke and HOYTS to create an All Stars cup.","replies":[{"poster":"Amourax","date":"2015-09-12T00:17:17.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is the cup 100% going to be made?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Amourax","date":"2015-09-09T20:11:42.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you! will you guys put an image up of it closer to the Date?
