Yeah I know Riot gave us the friend-note mechanics which is cool, but it would be cooler if you could see what other names a player (who may or may not be on your friend list) has taken before their current one. \n\nIdk, just a suggestion.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-29T11:02:26.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I also think it would be pretty cool to know other people's summoner names. From what I understand, OP.GG actually used to give past summoner names for any player, but the API rules changed for \"privacy reasons\" and it wasn't allowed anymore :(\n\nI see no reason why you shouldn't be able to have a detailed history of your own name changes though. Maybe a feature for the new client?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
