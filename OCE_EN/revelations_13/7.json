Why even build?","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can someone explain?\r\n\r\nSo I&#039;m buying a new GPU and I had a look at their full systems expecting a clear profit margin but I saw their GTX 960 system for $1200 with a 1 TB and a 120 GB SSD, and windows 7 included. I thought, I&#039;m not sure you can even buy the parts and build it yourself cheaper then that.\r\n\r\nSo I ROUGHLY went onto PC part picker shoved in the identical parts and had a look what it came to. All up it came out at $1993 for me including all the parts (except some LED lights they apparently put in somewhere) \r\n\r\nhttp://www.pccasegear.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=1411&amp;products_id=32313 ($1199) &lt;--- Their PC, built and ready to be shipped to you (with some led lights for lols)\r\nhttps://au.pcpartpicker.com/parts/partlist/ ($1193) &lt;--- The cost I came out with buying every part individually and ordering them\r\n\r\nI understand that you may want to build it so &quot;you know how it was built and handled&quot; etc. but they do a two year warranty and they would far more build experience then the avg one off/first time pc builder following a step by step youtube guide.... Not to mention this case has a window on it so it&#039;s obviously all you going to be nice and tidy.\r\n\r\nNow I&#039;m not wondering how they make profit, that&#039;s quite obvious, I just find it insane that they are selling this full fledged built pc with a 2 year warranty for the same price it&#039;d cost you to buy the parts individually, they are essentially assembling it for free. I can&#039;t believe this exact PC isn&#039;t at least 1.4k","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-20T09:11:37.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Buying each part costs more than the producer selling it in bulk to the retail which you use. The 2 year warranty is cheap because not everyone breaks their PC that often. You might not believe it, but Microsoft, Intel, nvidia, etc sell their parts and software for a really really really low price to pcpartpicker. Unfortunately, it's not easy to save money by buying in bulk, you get another 10 parts for every 1 you need and it costs more (in total, not per part) than 1 from the website you provide. Assembly takes time, not money, and costs a lot less than having it assembled by a third party (which is why it's not worth much anyway). 1.1k isn't very different from 1.4k since they probably gain 0.7k profit from each computer. Even if it's not very profitable, they could be selling it cheap on purpose so they get more customers. This is recommended with products that aren't bought often (unlike consumable products like detergent or coca cola), as there's less \"I have preference in this\" so the main grounds for sales is a low price","replies":[]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-07-19T17:34:04.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for sharing.
