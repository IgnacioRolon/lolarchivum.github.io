For one, for new players it would be what they start with, so they'd get used to it much faster than current players, and second, it impacts low elo players exactly the same as any other elo player: we all have got to get used to the change.\n\nPersonally, I can't say I like or dislike it, I've played two Arams with it and still have got some getting used to, but I think it's going to be a great change. Everything you need is in the one place (as they have explained) that you SHOULD be looking constantly: the minimap.

Can we have the tab of Champion info able to be permanently opened for other stats like spell pen % etc?\n\n2. I disliked that the Champion tabs were at the bottom right because I liked being able to click Champ picture on the left in cluster fights with Kayle ultimate so I can be sure I don't mislick someone, or so I can ulti a Teemo when he's under cho'gath because it's otherwise impossible and I don't think that Champ models interfering with spell casts should be a factor, I mean we can still click cast the Champ picture so it was in my opinion better on the left because it's 5x as easy to click for things like this and raka heals etc.\n\n3. The spells look like they are unavailable (out of mana) for a brief moment when they come off cooldown so sometimes you can't see in peripheral if you have mana for a spell, I think it should be Outlined in Red in cooldowns you're out of mana for that spell and flash blue when its off cooldown so you know, (like it does) and the Red outline should flash blue when it becomes available and if it's coming off cooldown and becomes available should flash blue (whole pic).\n\n4. Levelling up a spell should be colored not greyed out... (IMO).\n\n5. The tabs look cool, the map looks cool and I like the coloring, textures and cooldown feature.\n\nJust a few ideas anyway.\n\nEdit: Oh, the Champion stats tab is really unclear though, have to remember stats position to be able to check them quick, could be better icons or maybe bigger or something. Maybe like Red for offense section with better pics (bigger) and Blue for AP section etc.\n\nEdit2: Also where is the EXP tab?","replies":[{"poster":"Tonnkka","date":"2015-07-24T04:50:37.054+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you asking where to see how much experience you need to level up?
