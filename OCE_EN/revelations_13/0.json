Its so they don't look bad, they do nothing about it when you email and the tribunal is nonexistent so when people post it on forums Riot ends up looking stupid for doing nothing about it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Critterous","date":"2015-02-08T09:52:15.262+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh my....
