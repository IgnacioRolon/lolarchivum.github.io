You&#039;re going a normal game because you don&#039;t want the stress of playing ranked. Starting up, you don&#039;t mind what role you get, so you&#039;ll just fill. The champion select appears, and in the chat, is an instant spam of role calls, often conflicting.\r\n\r\nGuy 1: Mid\r\nGuy 2: Jgl\r\nGuy 1: Mid\r\nGuy 3: Mid\r\nGuy 1: Mid\r\nGuy 4: top pls\r\nGuy 3: Mid\r\nGuy 1: Mid\r\n\r\nAnd then guy 3 proceeds to lock in mid.\r\n\r\nall this happens in less than 2 seconds.\r\n\r\nA game that is highly reliant on communication still allows the complete lack of communication in a way that rewards people&#039;s greedy mindset, by granting them the champion or lane. If you have 4 adaptable people and 1 awful person, the 4 adaptable people can simply adapt, but sadly that&#039;s not the ratio we have in League of Legends. More often than not, there&#039;s multiple people seeking one role, and this number goes up dramatically during the first 2 weeks of a champion release. Kayn recently hit the rift, and people autolocking jungle is just purely tilting.\r\n\r\n**How do we stop it?**\r\n\r\nThe simple thing to do is to give the same ranked queue treatment to normals, however that has a few more problems than solutions. It doesn&#039;t allow for unconventional lane assignments, and will stop people from playing / learning multiple roles. If someone picks ADC and mid in normals, their games will be 90% mid and ADC, as compared to approximately 50% if they respect others in champ select.\r\n\r\nA new solution is this; **Disable champion lock-ins for the first 10 seconds of champ select**\r\n\r\nThis allows people the chance to call, and discuss, often settling call disputes, and allowing people to strategize as they wish.\r\n\r\nWe need a way to promote communication and understanding in champ select, because whatever is going on now, it ain&#039;t workin.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-07-13T08:14:33.163+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The whole process of calling lane in chat wasn't even implemented by Riot, I think they need to actually create a new and faster system then draft pick for the purpose of normals. I can't think of anything unique outside of \"lane calling\" so I suggest they improve on it by designing something where as everyone gets into champ select the client identifies the first person that calls \"Mid\" and has it appear under their name so everyone knows who got it, and so forth with every other role. This won't stop people from just instalocking but it will help settle a ton of arguments that always happen 90% of the time you queue up for normals.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Husy15","date":"2017-07-13T07:22:00.486+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"At a first glance, i thought this would work... However.. Insta-locking is not the root of the problem, and to properly remove an issue with ANYTHING, you must strike at the root of the problem.\n\nWhat is mean is:\n\nIF someone is thinking of taking a lane, and a champion, and not caring about their team... They will do this regardless, it doesnt matter if you stop them from locking in for the first 10 seconds, 30 seconds, minute... they will do this regardless...\n\nIt's very hard to fix the problem you've discussed, Even if they implemented draft mode, they would still arise with these same problems, people stealing lanes because \"it's not ranked, who cares, im taking mid, go support\".

Have time to chat with others and change as needed... 15-20 seconds should do.\nThen when you go into champ select... you are assigned a role based on preferences or chance (in the case of multiple people wanting the same role)\nJust reduce the champ select time by 15-20 seconds to compensate.\n\nOr... random assign lanes on entry into champ select, then can trade lanes with others.\n\nOr just change it so its like ranked.... {{champion:17}} \n\nAs a side note... In regards to lane trading... should make it official, like trading champs. One person initiates the trade request... and then the other person has to accept. This would be beneficial in ranked to remove confusion with swaps.\n\nIn regards to off meta team comps (lane wise)... should limit that to 5 man pre-made teams.\n\nIn addition... have to make sure those who don't comply with roles given are penalised appropriately... otherwise we are back at square 1.","replies":[]}]}
