Hey, can I get an assist?","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyya, hoping that a Red sees this. It's me, friendly neighborhood Jason.\r\n\r\nMy account was recently banned for third-party addons. I'd never used anything close to breaking the ToS, so figured it was a mistake, but ended up finding out there were some games on my account's recent activity that I definitely didn't play. So... it appears my account was compromised unfortunately.\r\n\r\nKnowing how these tickets usually go, and after the years I've put into the community of OCE League of Legends with hosting, running grassroots esports events, shoutcasting, and just helping out where I can, I'm not worried that I won't get my account back.\r\n\r\nI am, however, getting a little bit impatient. TFT has bought me back into the game, and I'm eager to start playing again. I am in the meantime stuck on my smurf account, which barely has half of all heroes unlocked ( not to mention missing my rad summoner name and expensive skins collection ).\r\n\r\nIs there a lot going on with player support at the moment? I'm hoping for an answer soon.\r\n\r\n&lt;3 s.","replies":[{"poster":"Jason","date":"2019-07-03T10:38:54.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=GojFENkq,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-07-03T06:34:24.857+0000)\n>\n\n> Even when support is busy they typically reply within 48 hours, but it's possible there's conflicting tickets or some such given this is an account recovery.\n> \n\nWithin 72 hours I got a response, where they moved my ticket from account recovery to the player behaviour team.

I haven't logged in to LoL in maybe a few months? ( I last remember playing URF mode a month or two after it came out ) and haven't played from any machines that aren't mine in quite some time, so I'm really not sure where this could have come from other than just randomness.\n\n\n> You should also look into any important accounts (emails, banks etc) just to make sure they're secure and aren't being affected by the same or similar compromises. The website https://haveibeenpwned.com/ is a great way to help track down compromises, so checking that out might be a good idea as well.\n\nI'll give that a shot. There's only one other account I've found has been compromised, as it shared the same password I use for League, and another 5ish services and games with the same password were untouched.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-07-03T11:05:33.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Presumably, that means you replied to the PB teams response and have since received no answer?

This is the first time I've been compromised on LoL ( Which sucks because I'm gonna have to learn a new password for the first time in years for LoL )\n\n2. I received a response that I was passed to player behaviour, and have not responded, to keep my place in the ladder as high as possible. I effectively communicated my position in the first email and didn't need to change anything, so long as they got around to it and understood the problem.\n\nI'm not worried about losing my account, I know how far player support goes for their players, I'm just upset it's taking so long....","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-07-03T13:46:54.723+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm odd.
