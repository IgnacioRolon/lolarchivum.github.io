Tell us something about yourself, just try to keep it M15 at absolute most.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that the first page of posters will be forever memorized and teased, and everyone else will be posting to a confessional wall that will slowly forget you. It&#039;s a good way to get things off your chest. I&#039;ll start.\r\n\r\nUp until 2013, I actually owned 10~ Fedoras and wore one to every event I went to, and legitimately thought they were cool. I still have one somewhere around here, and will be wearing it along with my neckbeard as a powernerd cosplay for halloween. Truely spooky, M&#039;lady.","replies":[]}
