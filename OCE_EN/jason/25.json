I'll be talking about the various laws the organization broke, Riot's poor response to the situation, and the path the players could have followed outside of Riot in order to (hopefully) hold Tainted Minds legally accountable.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B55qSaGRhuI","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B55qSaGRhuI/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"While the main linked video is what started this thread, this will be dedicated to categorizing developments as they occur.

She is a super sweet person who would go out of her way to help out anyone in need if it was within her power and she was blatantly disrespected, Bullied and put down because some guy has a fancy lawer. With the amount of laws, Human rights and contracts breached, I believe that TM should be made to compensate fully for not Just Fasffy, But the players and coaching staff fully as well as take a 2 year OPL Ban. Absolute joke! How will esports grow here if we have scum like this holding it back?","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-06-21T09:55:23.444+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be nice if Fasffy got compensated. The owner was very rude to her even in emails. Nothing will probably happen though, that's the nature of business. Wouldn't it be nice for people to admit their mistakes sometimes? However Tainted Minds seem to have already washed their hands clean of this saga, even renaming the league of legends team to \"TM Gaming\", perhaps to avoid google SEO and the like. I feel for both the previous and current set of players and coaches, but I have no respect for their organisation.\n\nOn a positive note though, it's good to see Inero coaching a top tier team now (Echo Fox). It seems like their owner is very player focused. Looper said that he was \"living in a palace\" and would love to stay with them for as long as possible.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jason","date":"2017-06-21T18:16:04.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm updating the thread now whenever more juicy gossip and news hits the streets.\n\nHopefully people that are either slightly behind on the times, or just not informed at all, will have all the information they need.\n\nPopcorn not included.","replies":[]}]}
