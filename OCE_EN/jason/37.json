It doesn&#039;t take an analyst to see that there&#039;s a general lack of satisfaction from a lot of players in terms of how well balanced the game is. Posts about a champion&#039;s power, kit, winrate, they&#039;re everywhere, from Reddit to the boards, there is a number that complain quite loudly about the game. However, there&#039;s a lot more that goes in to game balancing that most people tend to forget, even if it&#039;s stuff they know in the back of their minds. Allow me to present to you the issue with game design, and why there will never be a &quot;Perfect&quot; balance.\r\n\r\nSo before I start, I just want to bring up that I am in no way a professional analyst, nor am I highly ranked. However, I have a relatively long history with shoutcasting League of Legends, and producing Esports centric content on many platforms. So, I&#039;ve got a little bit of an idea about what&#039;s going on behind the scenes. Some of this information is also stuff that Rioters have mentioned, whether in AMAs, or game design panels. Most of the experienced designers have a speech memorised about the &quot;Levers&quot; system they try and work with, which I will be talking about a fair bit in this. So, enjoy.\r\n____________________________________\r\n**The new**\r\n________________________________\r\nThere&#039;s an innate learning that comes with experience whenever you play a game of League of Legends. If you play against a vayne, you&#039;ll start to realise that she tends to tumble, and might adjust your positioning or skillshots accordingly. When a Twitch goes missing, and someone dies, you learn to be highly alert about where their Twitch is at all times. If he runs into the brush for even more than half a second, ping missing and run the hell away. And if they have a Yasuo, you should just surrender @ 15 minutes. However, how do you play against a Floyd? now everyone is getting mad like, &quot;Who the hell is floyd?&quot; and &quot;There&#039;s no such champion.&quot; I mean, you&#039;re right I guess, but let&#039;s say Floyd is a thing now. Because you don&#039;t have tens ( or hundreds ) of games of experience to look back on him as a champion, you might not understand his play style, his utility, his range, his tankiness, and his general power. This would make it harder, and almost frustrating to play against at first, but as you build up  an understanding, he becomes more easy to manage. Now, this is something that happens consistently. Maybe not with Floyd. Maybe with Camille, or Warwick, or the new Rengar. Something that&#039;s relatively new is introduced into the system, which will create unbalance and upset while people adjust, and small tweaks are made to their kits to make them more in line with everyone else. \r\n\r\nCamille on release had over 55% winrate on her first day or two, and saw a very high ban rate ( as any champion does ), and Camille players got more experienced with her. However, at a certain point, this winrate started to drop very slowly. The community at large was slowly understanding her power and potential counterplay as she was appearing in a lot of games very quickly. Even the recent assassin update saw a large shift, however the winrates drastically fluctuated as people had to relearn what they already knew, and some champions ( Talon ) actually saw a dramatic drop in win rate over the first 48 hours ( parkour doe ). And even as of writing this, the only assassin that was a part of the update whom is still in the top 15 champions for ranked win rate is Shaco, at number 4 with 53.6% winrate. Mind you, out of all the assassins redesigned, Shaco&#039;s update was very VERY minor in comparison.\r\n_____________________________\r\n**Hypetrains**\r\n_____________________________\r\nWith the new, comes the desire to explore the new. Everyone wants to try the new thing, everyone wants to get on board the hype train, especially for champions they specifically are invested in ( Jhin is best gril, srs ). With this, comes inexperience. It&#039;s no surprise that people with over 100 games with a champion tend to have a higher win rate with that champion than people with less than 20 games on the champion. And the top bringers of hype trains are Releases, Buffs, and Professional play ( probably in that order, not 100% sure ). When a champion releases, there&#039;s a very low amount of people that aren&#039;t hit by the inexperience variable ( PBE players, people that go over the patch notes with a fine tooth comb, people that do research ect ), which means that not only are they going to be weak as players of that champion, but also against them. Or maybe a champion who was seen as insignificant receives some buffs that makes them quite a powerpick again ( See: Kassadin&#039;s damage changes ) . Esports also greatly effects things, as people will attempt to mimick what they see others do. For example, the plague of Miss Fortune support players at the end of Season 6.\r\n\r\nWith all of these variables playing into effect to paint a very messy picture of a champion&#039;s power levels, there are a lot of things that need to be considered before changes are made. If Riot knee-jerked at every single champion that had a spike or dip in win rate, then there&#039;d be chaos equivalent to watching someone falling over while juggling, attempting to coordinate all their limbs rather than just trying to regain composure. Let&#039;s say that, and this is a completely hypothetical situation not based on anything Riot has done in the past, but let&#039;s say an item comes out. This item works brilliantly with a specific champion, sending their winrate through the roof. Riot sees the power the item has on the champion, and then nerfs the champion to compensate. Following that, the item is nerfed ( or removed ), basically doubling down on the effect of the nerfs. However, the champion&#039;s win rate is only below average by 1-2%, so there&#039;s no need to buff them straight away. This is something that _ALLEGEDLY COULD_ happen, which brings us to our next point.\r\n____________________________________\r\n**Levers**\r\n______________________________________\r\nRioters tend to love this metaphor, it&#039;s great at simplifying an issue so complex they hire literally dozens of people to understand it. When any one thing in the game is changed, it will minorly, or majorly affect everything in the League of Legends environment. The introduction of Trinkets saw a spike in Lee Sin players attempting highly mechanical plays, and failing due to inexperience. Something which is a large improvement to the lives of Lee Sin players everywhere actually caused his winrate to DROP slightly. It wasn&#039;t until after the initial craze wore off that his winrate became more standout. When Poppy was released, champions with dashes saw a very minor drop, however one champion specifically, Riven, began losing winrate tiny bit by tiny bit. This was more noticable in Ranked, as Poppy became a staple counter to Riven. So this one was a lot smaller in size, but someone at Riot mentioned it to me, and I thought it was interesting.\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s take an example in the bottom lane, Ziggs has shot up through popularity and winrate, because he does everything that an AD carry does, but better. They can poke from afar, farm safely, clear waves, and turrets can be killed in a literal second later in the game. However, this is moreso a result of the &quot;Insta-death&quot; current meta, where an AP caster can instantly assassinate an AD carry ( Syndra with 3 balls out can kill someone without hitting a single ability. Just her ult with 6 balls and the right build ). So how do we fix this? We could change Ziggs to nerf him, but if the problem of why ziggs bot exists in the first place would still exist. He&#039;d also suffer a lot in the midlane if anything was changed that affects his ability to lane 1v1. We could see the changing of burst mages such as Syndra and Annie to give higher levels of counterplay, but then Ziggs bottomlane would still exist, purely because he&#039;s a better AD carry than actual AD carries. So, the decision is made to change both. The entire state of the game would shift, as burst mages have now potentially lost their burst, assassins can&#039;t assassinate, ziggs is out of the bottom lane, and AD carries are safe to farm again. Now if changing one champion can affect many, then how much disruption and discord would this change make? So while Riot is happy with Ziggs in the bottom lane as a &quot;Healthy alternative&quot;, balancing him so he&#039;s not the obvious power spike will prove diffucilt.\r\n_______________________________________\r\n**Waves**\r\n________________________________________\r\nAnother thing that data lovers like me will enjoy is that these changes and fluctuations tend to happen in an ebb and flow sort of manner, whether changes happen or not. The best example I can think of is quite recently with the redesign of Yorick. Since his rework in 6.18 his winrate has gone up and then down several times, as a cycle emerges of new players picking him up, some players improving and others moving on, improved players do well, inspiring new players to pick him up, and so on. While Yorick has received some changes and quality of life improvements, his stats remain unchanged since his re release. This is a little important. Even though the current patch has existed for some time and there&#039;s been no clear changes to his power, his winrate has not gone up or down consecutively over 2 of any of the last 5 patches, consistently being up, then down, in varying severities.\r\n\r\nGetting a wider sense of the game is important, and understanding the constant cycle of new and experienced players in turn changes the data given on how well a champion actually does in the League of Legends is one of the reasons that the balancing team has such a daunting task laid out in front of them. It all comes down to what data they choose to prioritise, and how often it&#039;s viewed. This brings us to our next point.\r\n______________________________\r\n**100**\r\n_______________________________\r\nWith League of Legends marketing itself as an Esport more and more, there&#039;s a much higher level of competitivity in the game. This is usually a good thing. However, even with competitive spirits high, the skill gap between different players and their demographics still exists, and rather prominently at that. With this, there&#039;s a different expectation as to what a low level player can do with a champion compared to what a high level player can do with it. Whether it&#039;s the Faker Zed play, Xpeke&#039;s legendary backdoor, Trick2G&#039;s udyr plays, or InSec basically inventing a manouver, better players can make champions seem a lot stronger than normal players. This is where the 100 comes into play. Riot needs to make a choice whether they balance the game based on the performance of the top 100 players in the world, or based on the data of 100% of their player base.\r\n\r\nBased on the laws of big numbers, data from 10 million players is going to eventually clear out as many possible outliers as possible, and be a lot more consistent. However, the pro play ecosystem also has to be considered. For example, Lee Sin is one of the game&#039;s most complex champions. With tonnes of mobility utility and damage in the right hands, he&#039;s a severe threat. However, the learning curve here is a lot steeper too. Let&#039;s say that Lee Sin currently had a winrate of 49%. It&#039;s kind of low. However, looking at the past 50 competitive games he was in, he won 43 of them. Now these facts are just made up, but represent a situation that can and has occurred before. Riot can&#039;t necessarily nerf the champion without hurting his already slightly low winrate. However leaving him be will put a strain on the competitive, &quot;Fair&quot; nature that Riot is trying to produce in their Esports image. A game where all champions have their own inherent powers, but anyone can win. Rather than the team that picks Lee Sin wins, or the team that picks Faker wins ( I&#039;m not sure if we can actually nerf faker though.... that&#039;s another story ). So we can be critical, however this is an issue a lot larger than most would remember.\r\n_________________________________________\r\n**Overall, Riot is doing.... Okay....**\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nYes, Release Camille was insane, and I&#039;m actively avoiding Ranked until Warwick and the Assassins get a bit of a love tap ( Also, Warwick and the Assassins sounds like a rad name for a band ), however they have made a game, that has millions of players getting highly passionate about game design, purely because they want their favorite game to be more balanced, and hopefully therefore more fun.\r\n\r\nThere&#039;s an inherently negative view on the choices of the Balance and gameplay teams ( like... plants? seriously? ), however these decisions are all put through such an extensive review before even being considered, that there&#039;s no surprise that they manage to release something a little too powerful, or accidentally give Vayne 20 Attack Damage. I just hope I managed to grant a little bit of a look from the other side.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________\r\n\r\n_seriously though nerf yasuo I hate this game as long as he exists in his current state\r\n_\r\n\r\nalso if any board volunteer can edit this post and center the text titles, that&#039;s not something we can actually do yet, and it&#039;d be nice. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Jason","date":"2017-02-03T03:03:32.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you're welcome :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2017-02-01T12:01:23.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tl;dr for the mentally impaired please.\n\nalso on a side note i dont believe riot want a balanced game. what they should be looking for is a perfect imbalance tbh.","replies":[{"poster":"Jason","date":"2017-02-01T15:41:21.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mesprit,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=EityGy9Q,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-02-01T12:01:23.816+0000)\n>\n> tl;dr for the mentally impaired please.\n> \n> also on a side note i dont believe riot want a balanced game. what they should be looking for is a perfect imbalance tbh.\n\nTL;DR\n\n- You change one thing, everything changes.\n- Pros are gonna be better than normal players at showcasing a champion's potential\n- You can't balance a champion based on pro play AND the player base at large\n- I understand the design decisions and still hate yasuo with a passion","replies":[{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2017-02-02T07:14:32.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for the tl;dr","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-02-01T05:30:15.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I personally believe the game is pretty close to being perfectly balanced. Most ranting and raving you hear, comes out of my ELO, where people don't realize that that champion isn't op, they've just picked up 10 kills.\n\nWhen you compare league to dota, Riot have definitely upped the bar in making their players happy. Dota is renowned for having 'stupidly op' characters. But honestly, from personal experience that comes down to their range and the lack of visual effects on abilities, giving players time to respond. Starting out on Dota often means getting nuked from miles away.\n\nIn league, every champion has its counter, if your team doesn't have a direct counter for the enemy that is proving to be a problem, you can pick up items, on multiple people if need be, which counter the enemy that is being a problem.\n\nI've read before that a thing Riot considers a lot in balancing, is how hard something is to pull off, versus how difficult the counterplay is. Counterplay should always be more difficult. Which can sometimes feel a little bit rigid, but some champions are always going to be able to decide how you lane against them. Eg, if Lux has a clear shot at you, most people will move back behind their minions. If Katarina's knife falls directly in front of you, you flash away and teleport to a different lane. You know what I'm saying? :P\n\nAnother thing I really, really hate seeing is people being salty about 'balance' after they get out played.\nSince the changes over the last year, making it extremely difficult to actually solo carry a game, the game seems to have fallen back on it's foundation. Team fighting. Marksmen are still the most reliable late game damage, but with the state that tanks and mages are in right now, the days of the 1v5 are just about over.\n\nWith these changes in mind, I can't really see any flaw with Riots balance.\n\nOh and hey, if you hate Yasuo with a passion, come on down to the Howling abyss and watch him, along with other crowd favourites such as Katarina and Diana feed their asses off because they can't solo carry.","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-02-01T05:32:45.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Additionally, I'm all for the game being balanced around the pro scene.
