This year, I got to be a volunteer for the Melbourne viewing party at Hoyts in High point. What I thought would be a fun time helping give out swag, answer questions and help viewers with small things, ended up being one of the most fun hosting roles I&#039;d ever played. Among the other volunteers, the organised Host unfortunately didn&#039;t show. And as a result, I got to do the talky thing. But the day overall was pretty full on, and not everything went to plan.\r\n\r\n_Oh, there will be spoilers btw._\r\n\r\n_____________________\r\n**9:20 - Setup**\r\n\r\nThere was one or two fans already outside of the Hoyts, which at this stage hadn&#039;t even opened. We had some setup to do, which involved assembling the Riot swag into showbags.... which we didn&#039;t have enough of for everyone. We had to resort to giving them out randomly between the games to people. Some missed out, but most were happy. I even saw one or two people sharing with complete strangers. It was kind of a touching moment. A few members from the Dire wolves showed up to setup their giveaway stuff too. There was a lot of free stuff here. I even almost got lost trying to find a Woolworths to buy raffle tickets last minute. We had some Teemo statues to give away, so passing out raffle tickets would be the most fair way. \r\n\r\n________________________\r\n**9:40 - Stream test**\r\n\r\nThe stream test began, and while the picture was fine.... there was no sound. Jokingly I told them just to plug in the aux cable, but they didn&#039;t necessarily appreciate that. So my first duty involved heading out into the now fairly substancial crowd, and getting them lined up in the right place. I told them that we were doing some final testing and the doors would open the second we got things fixed.\r\n\r\n_________________________\r\n**9:55 - Things weren&#039;t fixed**\r\n\r\nWe decided to start moving the people into the cinema so they could get comfy and find their chairs and whatnot. The stream was now fully off so they could test something and get a fix, and there was 5 minutes to opening ceremony. I had to again explain that there were issues, but we&#039;re working on them, and we&#039;ll be moving people inside. There was this mixed feeling of excitement, and disappointment, as noone likes tech issues. The opening ceremony begins right as the first few people make their way inside.... and we still don&#039;t have audio. That amazing music performance by Zedd and the orchestral band, completely missed out. The hype intro for all the players, completely missed out. ( Though the crowd still cheered for Faker, even without sound ). So by 10:40ish, the games have gone into pick-ban phase. Still no sound. The manager of hoyts has ran out the door to JB hifi to grab a part that potentially may save the day, but if that doesn&#039;t work, we were told a technician was required, which could take up to three hours. By this point, we knew that our other hype guy wasn&#039;t going to show up, leaving things to me. I&#039;d always wanted to shoutcast worlds, but not like this. _NOT LIKE THIS....._\r\n\r\n_____________________________\r\n**3 minutes into game 1**\r\n\r\nWith a click, the sound begins playing. The crowd lets out a cheer for the event finally being up to standard, and commences watching the games. I was so relieved, we didn&#039;t have to wait for a technician. From here, I relaxed a lot, and managed to go sit down with my friends for a while. It was a pretty long game, but after 54 minutes, SKT took the game. After the first game, I&#039;d had a chance to relax, and I knew our event wasn&#039;t on the brink of being broken. That&#039;s when I came out of my skin a little. I got the microphone and managed to hype up the crowd of approximately 220 people.  One of the other volunteers was a lifesaver and managed to take down some smart questions for giving away hextech chests to the community.  I felt like I was the face and voice of the event, but the people I was working with were damn organized. All I did was speaky stuff, they felt like the real heroes of the event.\r\n\r\n______________________________\r\n**Game 2 &amp; 3**\r\n\r\nAfter game 2, with SKT winning very quickly, the possibility of a 3-0 stomp was all too real. We still managed to get people excited, though one or two groups were leaving early. Stuff to do, more interesting stomps to watch, I guess. But then, the incredible happened. Over the course of a 70 minute game, Samsung Galaxy brang it back. They had managed to defeat SKT in one of the longest games in worlds history. This game was so exciting, that people who had a clear favorite to win were all cheering for anyone, because everything was just so close. When it was my go to get on the microphone, I gave a huge performance, basically just yelling at one point. I was so excited, and every member of the crowd was right on board. That was a pretty amazing feeling.\r\n\r\n_______________________________\r\n**Game 4 &amp; 5**\r\n\r\nAfter game 4, the cinema was down to probably around 180 people. Not everyone expected this day to go on as long as it did. Those that stayed were so hyped, because for the first time in WORLDS HISTORY, the finals were going through to a game 5. Years of play and practice, weeks of tournament play, and hours of gruelling competition, it all came down to this. Honestly, I want to thank SSG and SKT for doing my job for me. Getting people excited after THAT, it wasn&#039;t hard. Then game 5 happened, and in the end, SKT ended up being the worlds 2016 champions, and 3 time winners. To wrap up, we gave out the last of our hextech chest/key combos, and teemo statues, and the Dire wolves gave away their awesome monitor, as well as some shirts, and that was the event, done for the day. \r\n\r\n_______________________________\r\n**The crowd**\r\n\r\nThe crowd was pretty amazing, everyone was a vocal supporter for one, or both eSports teams. Everyone was having a great time, and enjoying the games. There was, however..... one issue. We had thundersticks at the event, for clapping purposes. However, at some point at late game 2 or early game 3, some genius had discovered that you can remove the L.E.D. &#039;s from inside the thundersticks, becoming just plastic flashing balls. He then had the idea to throw it into the air, towards the front of the crowd. It caught people&#039;s attention, and within 5 minutes, there were one or two more L.E.D. &#039;s being thrown about. It did look pretty awesome, but I was worried for the safety of the people in the front areas, who were all but in the direct firing line of the back row&#039;s L.E.D. mischief. The other organizers were also pretty pissed off, as something we&#039;d given to people to use and enjoy were basically being destroyed and trashed. At one point in game 4, someone had amassed about 20 flashing balls, and flung them all into the air after an awesome teamfight, and this got the crowd cheering just as much as the teamfight itself did. It felt like I was in a beta for Call of Duty 13 or something crazy. End of the day, noone got hurt, so I&#039;m not upset, but I wasn&#039;t overly happy either. Oh well.\r\n\r\n___________________________________\r\n**Wrapping up**\r\n\r\nSo after a long day,  it was all done. I&#039;d even had a few people stick around, and thank me and the other organizers for doing such a good job. I&#039;ve been doing online events for years, but this &quot;real&quot; praise was still a pretty new feeling to me. And I gotta say, it felt pretty great. I didn&#039;t manage to get a maokai sapling after all was said and done, but I did get a mini poster, which honestly I&#039;m not going to complain about. I also didn&#039;t expect any form of reward, so I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Riot likes to give a little back to their volunteers. After all of this, I&#039;d managed to get home, and I was in bed before 7:30, something that&#039;s really never happened to me.\r\n\r\n____________________________________\r\n**Departing thoughts**\r\n\r\nI&#039;m pretty proud of everything that&#039;s happened. From my first LAN shoutcasting gig at EB Expo 2013, to my shoutcasting at Melbourne Comic-con this year, I&#039;ve done a fair bit of time in front of an audience. However, for the first time, my job wasn&#039;t to shoutcast, or analyze the games. My job was to entertain the crowd, and just be my charismatic self with a microphone. **For the first time, my job was to be me.** And I&#039;ve gotta say, it&#039;s probably been the most amazing thing I&#039;ve done this year. \r\n\r\n______________________________________\r\n\r\nI&#039;d like to thank my two colleagues for doing a lot of heavy lifting, and letting me do what I&#039;m best at. I&#039;d also like to thank Riot for the chance to be a part of such a cool event, and Dire Wolves for coming out and representing the local scene. Oh, and XxXTeemoLoverxXx for giving me a ride home and Penny for buying me lunch. Love your faces.\r\n\r\nIf you were at the event, feel free to show some love in the comments. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Jason_OCE), [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/jasontheaussie), and occasionally [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/JasontheAussie/). \r\n\r\nHope to see you guys around!","replies":[{"poster":"GeneralCoxy","date":"2016-11-01T20:10:21.550+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Awesome write up, and I am so glad you could have a great time at the event but more importantly hype the crowd and keep the atmosphere buzzing!
