In that writing includes a few fan fictions about League of Legends. Last year my piece &quot;[Her Purple Hair](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/contest-fan-fiction/12Eobv7b-her-purple-hair-ekko)&quot; made [Froskurinn&#039;s Picks](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/contest-fan-fiction/ORmqvHsO-fanfiction-contest-the-shortlist), and earlier this year my piece [Immersion](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/contest-fan-fiction/ZHTOAXAX-volunteer-ocean-week-story-writing-competition?comment=0000) placed second in the Volunteers fanfic contest ( there was only like 5-7 entries, so it&#039;s not as impressive I think )\r\n\r\nThis time around, I wanted to give myself a bit of a challenge, so I decided to come up with a story, but force myself to reinvent it&#039;s format when I was done. Once my story was finished, I thought it&#039;d potentially look great as a poem. Over the next day or two, as I worked on the poem entitled &quot;Four&quot;, I felt it was missing something.... and at that point, an old Johnny cash song came on the radio, and it just.... felt right. So, I decided I&#039;d find a basic backing beat somewhere, and turn this into a video.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not great at country accents, so I had [a friend](https://www.youtube.com/user/guckopradley) who is way better than me at country accents come in to try and record it, however we didn&#039;t end up finishing stuff, so I was left on my own. Under duress, I finished the video myself. Still unhappy with my accent, I present to you, Four.\r\n\r\n[Click here for the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQQL4iwgDU)\r\n\r\n[Click here to download just the poem](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w4rtq37jiu94f8d/Four%20by%20Jason.pdf?dl=0)\r\n\r\nEnjoy, guys!","replies":[{"poster":"Nadette","date":"2017-03-29T07:24:36.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually love this so much.
