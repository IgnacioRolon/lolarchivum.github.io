I&#039;ll tell you what happened... but you have to PROMISE not to tell anyone. And if you even giggle at me, someone&#039;s getting a bat to the head. So... this is how the time travelling wonderkid was stumped.&quot;\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nSo, Nyx and Erebus told me there was a nice flower field outside of town, and asked me to get some. It was a lazy day, so I thought why not. Once you leave the city limits, you rarely run into people, but that wasn&#039;t why she stood out.\n\nI saw her as she was tending to a bloom of flowers, with amazing care and precision, her purple hair flowed down just past her shoulders. She&#039;s... beautiful. I guess you could say she was out, standing in her field? hah, yeah, anyway....\n\nShe hadn&#039;t seen me yet, so I took the opportunity to set my Zero-Drive, you know, just in case.... I try and muster up a confident smile, as I gently kneel down next to her. &quot;Hey, umm, excuse me, you&#039;re reAALy... agghhh...&quot; I splutter on my words as her beautiful smile skews. Alright, I&#039;ll just do it again, no problem.\n\n**Rewind**\n\nAlright... It&#039;s just a cough. No big deal. I shoo away my metaphorical butterflies and try again, kneeling down next to her. &quot;Ahm, excuse me, I just wanted to say you&#039;re very prettiful....&quot; She lets out a short giggle as my face rewires itself to cringe... I just combined Pretty and beautiful.... and it did not work. This hurts.\n\n**Rewind**\n\nAlright, one more time, I&#039;ll get this easily. No need to overthink it. I go to kneel down, but my impatience gets the better of me. I fall too hard onto my knee as my face falls directly into the brush. I didn&#039;t notice the thorns on these flowers until they were jammed into my arm. Without saying anything, I reach for my wrist.\n\n**Rewind**\n\nAlright, so I&#039;ve now got pains in my arm and face, but this isn&#039;t a big deal. I&#039;ve faced tougher opponents than this, this is just a girl in the woods. Let&#039;s try something else. I&#039;ll walk past her and turn back. Yeah. Easy. I take a second to focus on making sure I don&#039;t look injured, put on my smile, and strut past with a mild confidence. Alright, shaking things up again, we&#039;re doing good. I turn to face her, and gain her attention by gesturing towards her. She looks up at me. The first time I&#039;m seeing her face. Her innocent smile, her dark hazel eyes.... she&#039;s still looking at me.... Damn, I forgot, I have to say something! &quot;Uhh, do you... like.... flowers?&quot;.... Pathetic.... She&#039;s kneeling down in a bush of flowers, and I ask her that? Ughh.... her facial expression says it all. I can&#039;t bear this.\n\n**Rewind**\n\nAlright, we&#039;ll do that again, but with a question that&#039;s less lame. Something genuine and inquisitive just to start a conversation, and we&#039;ll take it from there. Fake smile on, and strut mode engage. I turn and gesture towards her again. &quot;Hey, excuse me.... do you.... have the time by chance?&quot; Alright, kind of shaky, but not too bad, let&#039;s go with that. She lets out a short giggle as she looks towards my wrist. &quot;Oh, no, no.... this isn&#039;t a watch... it&#039;s a... thing....&quot; I&#039;m way too nervous... I feel a sweat beading down my cheek. Ughh.... why is this so hard! She gestures towards her wrists with pure elegance, showcasing the lack of watch there, as she forces a smile. &quot;Ahh... that&#039;s.... oh....&quot; I.... The pressure is immense.\n\n**Rewind**\n\nAlright.... One more.... Let&#039;s keep it simple... I feel like I&#039;ve thought that before.... I take a deep breath and smile. Hopefully this&#039;ll be enough.  I walk up, speaking gently as to not alert her. &quot;They&#039;re beautiful, aren&#039;t they?&quot; She looks back up towards me, and smiles.\n&quot;Yeah, they&#039;re really nice...&quot; It&#039;s the first time she&#039;s spoke, her voice was beautiful and soft. Alright, focus. We got this.\n&quot;I know most people in Zaun, but... I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve met you yet.&quot;\n&quot;Oh, I&#039;ve been around for a little while.&quot;\n&quot;Well, it&#039;s nice to meet you, I&#039;m...&quot;\n&quot;Ekko.&quot; She cuts off my sentence.... She knows who I am, she&#039;s known this entire time. My first instinct was to reach for my wrist, but something tells me I should stay. &quot;So, you&#039;re here for the Autumn lions, too?&quot;\n&quot;Uhh, yeah.... My friends wanted some for an experiment, and they look pretty cool, so...&quot;\n&quot;So tell me, how many times have you talked to me in the last ten seconds?&quot;..... She calls me out. She knows who I am, and my powers. That&#039;s kind of scary. I guess my reputation proceeds me in Zaun.  &quot;I&#039;ll take your silence for a few.... It must be nice, having the ability to do things without consequences.&quot;\n&quot;Hah, well... sometimes there&#039;s no avoiding consequences. The best you can do is just make sure they&#039;re the least harmful, you know?&quot;\n&quot;Not really.... I guess that&#039;s something only you&#039;d have to deal with.&quot; She gives off \n&quot;Heh, I guess so....&quot;\n&quot;Hmm.... I want to try it.&quot; She looks up at me, thoughts obviously formulating behind her beautiful eyes. I don&#039;t really get where she&#039;s going, but I&#039;m sure she&#039;s about to tell me.\n\n&quot;You have the ability to go back at a moment&#039;s notice, right?&quot; she asks inquisitively\n&quot;Uhh, yeah, I just twist this, and.... back I go.&quot;\n&quot;Alright.... I have a plan.&quot; I feel as though I can trust this stranger, but the look in her eyes worries me just a little. &quot;What you&#039;re going to do, is go back in time, pick some flowers, and say nothing. Just smile, and walk away.&quot;\n&quot;Uhh... why?&quot;\n&quot;Listen. Once you&#039;ve done that, go off to your friends. Tomorrow, swing by Reedus&#039; bakery around closing time. Strike up a conversation.&quot; I&#039;m slightly confused.\n&quot;....Why are you telling me this?&quot;\n&quot;Because.... I like you...&quot; This girl, this girl I&#039;ve only known for ten minutes.... well, thirty seconds in her time, and she likes me? &quot;I thought you were too cool, but you&#039;ve been time travelling just so you could talk to me. That nervous smile I saw when you asked about the flowers... I can tell you&#039;re a good guy.&quot;\nShe begins to get up, each movement slow and purposeful. &quot;You know you won&#039;t remember this when I go back, right?&quot;\n&quot;You have a nice smile.... if I see it, I&#039;m sure I&#039;d know.&quot; I feel really nervous, but the nerves melt away as they&#039;re met with her smile.\n&quot;Tell me, what&#039;s your name?&quot; She lets off a mischevious giggle, \n&quot;Now if I tell you, that&#039;d be cheating.&quot; Confused, I give a slight raise of my eyebrow. &quot;I&#039;ve given you more than you need to find out my name, now if I don&#039;t tell you, the only way you could find out is if you do as I&#039;ve asked.&quot; She has a relatively good point. I mean, I could just rewind and ask her name, she&#039;d never know, but.... I don&#039;t think telling her would help at all. I give off an affirming nod.\n&quot;Alright... you won&#039;t remember it, but I guess it&#039;s a date.&quot; She walks up to me with a smile, as her face goes seldom for a moment.\n&quot;...The ability to act... without consequences....&quot; She leans in and grabs me by scarf, pulling me to her. Our lips meet. I&#039;m caught off by what&#039;s happening, but eventually find myself relaxing. We move closer, as her hand traces down my arm.... and to my wrist. My wrist..... no, she&#039;s-\n\n**Rewind**\n\nI fly back to where I once was, looking on to her, tending to her flowers. I don&#039;t have nerves, I&#039;m not scared, and even better, thanks to this girl,  I know what I need to do. I bend down, and pick some of the Autumn Lions. I&#039;m not sure which ones are the good ones.... I should have asked her.... oh well. I look over to her, as she&#039;s inspecting me. Our eyes meet, and I let out a sincere smile. She matches it with her own. I then get up, and walk away. \n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n&quot;So that&#039;s why you&#039;re bailing on us tomorrow? you met some girl?&quot;\n&quot;Pffft, pansy. Don&#039;t hurt her widdwe feewings Ekko.&quot;\n&quot;Alright... I have a solution to this.&quot;\n\n**Rewind**\n\n&quot;I can&#039;t hang out tomorrow because of what happened this afternoon....&quot; I tell them as I adjust my Zero-Drive. &quot;Alright, fine. I.... forgot to set my Zero-drive, and hurt my leg. I&#039;m getting a medic to look at it tomorrow, as it hurts a bit.&quot;\n&quot;So that&#039;s why you&#039;re bailing on us tomorrow? you idiot, I thought you went flower picking, and you hurt yourself?&quot;\n&quot;Pffft, pansy. You told us you ALWAYS set your Z-drive whenever there&#039;s a risk of some sort.&quot;\n&quot;Yeah.... I do.&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"Jason","date":"2016-06-27T06:20:01.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"word count; 1499.\n\nPushin it, I know, but hope y'all enjoy :)","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-06-27T08:58:54.573+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jason,realm=OCE,application-id=wJE2nAgV,discussion-id=12Eobv7b,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-06-27T06:20:01.146+0000)\n>\n> word count; 1499.\n> \n> Pushin it, I know, but hope y&#x27;all enjoy :)\n\nMy word count was bang on 1500 lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AdcStoleMyAs5ist","date":"2016-07-10T03:09:10.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually an enjoyable read - I guess that's _one_ thing you could do with a Z-Drive...\n\nOn a side, I like the emergent narrative you've exposed around it: I'm sure many people in Runeterra, for selfish or selfless reasons alike, would love to get their hands on such an invention.

When strange is the norm, than average becomes extraordinary. I think I did an alright job, but we'll see how it fares in the competition. :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-06-27T14:44:10.708+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"that 2nd rewind nails it\n\n----\n\ndefinitely one of the top 3 stories","replies":[]},{"poster":"itsaneeps","date":"2016-07-28T06:22:40.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's so sweet, I developed holes in my teeth!
