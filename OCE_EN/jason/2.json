She doesn't remember why, or how long ago it was. She has feint memories of people she used to know. That doesn't matter now.\n\nAfter years in the Void, where time moves irradically ( and not always forward ) Claire has lost most of her sanity. She learnt and inherited Magic within the void, to help survive the unpredictable nature of a world without laws of morals or physics.\n\nShe met a wounded child, who was Banished into the void. Using her magic, she kept the child alive by enstilling some of her life essence within the child. Her magic drew attention from some hostile abominations of the void. She managed to save the young girl's life. The young girl, who was also somewhat adept at \"void magic\" tried to heal Claire back. By doing so, they accidentally formed a bond. Their minds are linked, and their bodies grow weak when the other is away, like they're feeding off each other's magic power to live.\n\nThe child finally introduces herself as \"Alexis\". The two roamed the void for what seemed years, growing a friendship, and protecting one another. They then began to combine their efforts and energy, trying to create a rift, back to the \"real\" world.\n\nThey created a rift, and passed through it, finally back in the \"real\" world, however, on looking back, they saw their bodies in the void, standing motionless, as creatures began to close in on the rift. They managed to close it, but as it shut, it caught Claire's right hand. It tore through her flesh, and moulded onto her arm. Alexis also caught a complication, as she seemed to be disjointed from the world, flickering constantly between existence and nothing. The same was happening to Claire, but only minorly, and for less than a second at a time. Alexis disappeared for sometimes a whole minute, with only small flickers of her existing to comfort Claire.\n\nIn the real world, their magical dependance on one another weakened. Alexis swore to Claire that she would give her life for her, and protect her in any way possible. They roamed a strange wetland ( the howling marsh ) before being confronted by a beast. As Claire went to fight it, Alexis found herself in a state of limbo, as if she wasn't entirely in reality. Claire channeled her magic to Alexis, like she did when she was healing her, and Alexis seemed to come back as a solid body. They fought the beast as a team successfully. Claire weakened her healing bond, as it was draining her, and Alexis began to sift reality again.\n\nAfter some wandering, they reached civilisation. The duo went to enlist in the League of Legends, in hope of finding answers from other political figures that are associated with the void. Claire successfully gained entry. They tried to match Claire for fights alone, but Alexis found her way to Claire's side, like neither of them were controlling it. League ministers noted Alexis as a \"Companion\", so the team would battle together.\n\nClaire is in search of answers and knowledge, not remembering who she was, or why she existed. With her discoveries, she's learning more and more, that her story is quite small and insignificant, and now she wants to learn more about the goings on around Runeterra.\n\n**Lore Quotes;**\n\n\"I don't remember the past, but that won't stop me from discovering my future\" - Claire\n\"I shall fight with you, Claire\" - Alexis\n\"Alexis and Claire are a direct link between our worlds, and they can harness magic directly from the Void\" - Malzahar\n\n\n\nGameplay\n\nClaire is a Unique style of Ap mid, whose presence and synergy with Alexis in team fights can change the tide of a game.\n\n**Basics on Abilities;**\n\nPassive; Alexis\nAlexis mimics Claire's abilities, dealing 50% reduced damage if hitting the same target as Claire.\n\nAlexis roams and warps around the map, occasionally assisting with battles / fights / vision. \n\nQ; Void Essence\nPassive; allows Alexis to journey further away from Claire\n\nActive; Claire's arm shoots outwards at a target, dealing damage to enemies in a thin line. Enemies behind the target take additional damage.\n\nW; Void Rift\nPassive; after taking damage, Claire's next attack gains magic damage based on her Ability Power\n\nActive; cast one. to begin channeling, slowing Claire by 40% and reducing damage taken for 5 seconds ( 1 second to next cast, 4 seconds total possible channel ).\nActive; cast two.

If Claire dies while Alexis is alive, Alexis and Claire swap places and health.\n\nSome examples of situations for Claire.\n\nx champion engages, and Claire begins to channel her W, to take less damage. She can either jump on the target, stun them and deal some decent damage, jump to Alexis if she's nearby, or jump away, and maybe land a long range Q\n\nx champion ganks Claire, who immediately summons Alexis on their spot, and activating E to stun them. She can then either Void rift away, or to Alexis for the small sustain. If she gets low, she can send Alexis another way, die, and swap spots, getting away safely.\n\n**In Depth on Abilities**\n\nPassive; Alexis\nAt level one, Alexis is 20% likely to be seen around. She is uncontrollable in this state, besides ability activation.\nIf she takes damage, she despawns, starting a 10 second cooldown before appearing again.\nAs Alexis moves around the map, her static figure can be seen from time to time, and will occasionally grant a small short area of vision ( 10 second cooldown, for 3 seconds )\nAlexis can run into a lane, and attack enemy champions. She can also attack towers, and objective neutral monsters, if other champions are already attacking them.\nAlexis has the base AD and Atk speed of Claire, whilst everything else scales to Claire's current ( armor, mage resist, max hp )\nAlexis may be based on RNG, however a good Claire player will change their play style depending on what Alexis is doing.\n\nQ; Void Essence\nPassive; allows Alexis to journey further away from Claire\nEach level allows another 800 range for Claire to roam in.\nThe default ( level 0 )range is approximately from mid's brush to dragon pit, and at max, can reach bot lane from mid.\n\nActive; Claire's arm shoots outwards at a target, dealing damage to enemies in a thin line.

It's a concept I'll do a complete rework of if an opportunity comes up, but for now this is the overall idea.\n\nWith her W, she doesn't really leap. She phazes out of existence, and appears at a target location. Imagine if you have flash, but for 0.1 seconds during the flash you're nowhere. Her travel time will make her untargetable for such a brief time that it's not really worth using to dodge specific damage. It's mainly for escaping an inevitable situation, or jumping into a fight.\n\nAs for her damage, I'm thinking a lot of low cooldown, high range, low damage poke. Thinking I could redo the Q to be something along those lines, but nothing has came to mind just yet.\n\nThe few parts of the concept I don't want to remove include her unreliable friend, and her shifting of realities. If you have a good idea to bounce off with those concepts, go for it :)","replies":[{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2015-03-28T14:08:58.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, I love where you are going with this.\n\nFor me, a good ability for her Q which would make her even stronger as an initiator like her father, Kassadin is to give her a really nice AoE Poke ability which separates her.\n\nI would imagine something like 2 arcs collapsing inwards to create a straight line, it's hard to explain but imagine 2 Diana Q which point inwards.\nNow imagine the curvy part moving inwards and then exploding. I hope it explains or gives you a rough imagine of what it is.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2015-03-26T07:34:52.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I remember correctly you originally made this concept on the forums. Nice to see it back, I already reviewed on it back then, I can't remember if you responded or not but my mind tells me you didn't. Anyways I can't be bothered to do a full review of it but just to here to say that's it just as good as it used to be of a concept. :3 Check out my concepts I just made if you want ^.^\n\nEDIT: Just skimmed through it, wasn't as detailed as I hoped since you would've had time to redo it but it looks like if you have just copied and pasted and fixed up a bit. (Not 100% sure if you did or not)\n\nThe abilities are alright but her W is a bit weird. Usually void champions don't really 'leap' unless they're like Kha'Zix. I think it'd be nice if she went down a void portal and appeared in the selected location. Really similar to Zac otherwise.\n\nShe seems kind of weak, like a weird mixture of Riven and Zac into an AP Mid Laner, she has no real damage other than her Q and all Claire is going to be good for is to send her into the middle of the fight with W and then E and then still, she has no real damage other than her Q. She's going to need to do insane poking with it, yes she's a bit like Kassadin (Her dad) where he can jump in, blow up all his abilities, Zhonya's then hop out. But she doesn't seem like that champion unless she flashes out or in then jumps out but that would just make her weaker.\n\nPersonally I would make her a more poke reliant champion than a full engage. Overall good design in mind but doesn't seem good overall, Lissandra greatly outscales her as a champion since she has the ult to save her or to deal more damage and allow her team to follow up about 5 seconds of invulnerability.
