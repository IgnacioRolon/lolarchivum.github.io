So, let&#039;s go over the main points.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2017, a notable number of Oceanic based casters moved away to different regions, to focus their casting abilities there. Specifically, Korea, Japan, and China. While losing numbers in the office isn&#039;t a great thing, they were still going to be working on the game, in their career path, and have a high chance of working with their colleagues again in the future. So, the casters were congradulated, and let off to be amazing elsewhere.\r\n\r\nJust after PAX Australia, 2 Riot employees departed Riot Games. Marauder ( Community Manager ) and Riot Loote ( Events ).\r\n\r\nThen, this month, 2 more prolific Rioters departed. Loatheyy ( Player management / pro wrangler ) and MasterMirkinen ( Head of Riot OCE ).\r\n\r\nThis is just from memory.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve had decent conversations with all of the above Rioters, and actual friendships with half of them. I have full faith they&#039;ll be fine, but... what about Riot OCE?\r\n\r\nI&#039;m curious as to what it&#039;s been like since the office got smaller. I can&#039;t imagine the Sydney office being the same without MasterMirkinen&#039;s radiating smile. While responsibilities and tasks can be delegated, pure manpower and morale look like they&#039;re going to be at a pretty low point. How is everyone doing? Is Riot downscaling purposefully to facilitate their broadcasting facilities? Is Riot handling Hiring processes internally to bring in more members? WHO&#039;S GOING TO STOCK THE VENDING MACHINES NOW?!\r\n\r\nAll the love, to Rioters past and present.\r\nThat community guy,\r\n~Jason","replies":[]}
