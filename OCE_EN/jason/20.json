( pretty interesting story inside )","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Alright, so this began last week, when a petition was started by an angry catholic mother, who was appalled by this R18+ game, and moved to get it banned from sale over the Christmas period. It calls upon the game's graphic violence, sexual content ( including 'gameplay' ) and apparently encouraging sexual and physical violence towards women. Because everyone knows, the sole reason GTA5 exists is to pay hookers and then kill them for your money back.\r\n\r\nWhen this passed through Target and K-mart, a lot of gamers were upset by this. I mean, it's got a rating of R18+, I really hope that parents aren't so irresponsible as to think this would be a good idea as a stocking filler. A rebuttal petition has been created, moving to get the Bible removed from stores, as it's actually got a lot of content that isn't so 'Child-friendly', and hey, anyone can buy those.\r\n\r\nThere are exact quotes from the bible ( and christian artworks of these times ) regarding women who were sexually assaulted, then publically slaughtered pretty much. A real lesson in life lies in here somewhere I'd like to hope, otherwise it'd seem that the bible-loving parents will get upset regarding their hypocrisies and ruin something else we love in the process.\r\n\r\nIf you feel like signing the petition, check it out here; tinyurl.com/BanDatBible \r\n\r\nAlso, this is my take on the story, mostly facts, but some opinionism is included. Feel free to read up on it elsewhere before formulating your own opinion, as we encourage free thinkers here.","replies":[{"poster":"JoashT","date":"2014-12-07T13:44:52.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"catholic and christianity are different\n\n(Jesus Loves You)","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2014-12-07T23:21:18.365+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> catholic and christianity are different\n> \n> (Jesus Loves You)\n\nCatholicism is a type of Christianity.","replies":[{"poster":"SoresuMakashi","date":"2014-12-12T07:31:19.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GoldenTomat0,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=V1MByijI,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2014-12-07T23:21:18.365+0000)\n> Catholicism is a type of Christianity.\n\nJesus no longer loves you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Malignus","date":"2014-12-07T01:20:04.506+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"OP this has nothing to do with LOL, don't clutter up the boards with this anti-religous junk.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-12-06T13:35:17.540+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If the bible gets banned what will I use to roll my blunts? ♥♥♥♥ off OP bad idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-06T13:37:47.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Twilight.","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-12-06T13:38:53.941+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Twilight.\n\nI don't want gay weed, ♥♥♥♥ I guess I'll just take the next step and start injecting marijuanas.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2014-12-07T11:54:28.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Religion of any kind's base function is to control the masses, and it does that mostly through fear, usually the fear of going somewhere unpleasant after you die, \nand relies on a \"serve me now and ill make sure you go somewhere nice\" approach and while this was an effective and necessary means back in the middle ages and such our society has evolved to a point where religion is no longer helpful, in-fact it is actually the opposite now, religion restricts a lot of people and prevents them from putting back into society what society put into them. \nbut i also think people should be free to believe what they want but not be scammed/forced into it which is what 99% of religions do\nso personally i would agree with removing the bible but not because of the violence to women thing, thats just feminist garbage \nmillions more men have died in combat in pointless religious conflicts than women so get over it feminists\nbut in saying that i do hate the whole GTA series.\n\ni would say that i don't think banning the bible could happen because of the whole human rights thing but... \nin america a guy saved a womans life with CPR and after she recovered she sued him for sexual harassment because he put his hands on her chest.\nin a world where that can happen i don't think ill be surprised by anything.\n\n\nyou can tell its late and im bored for me to write this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shoklimb","date":"2014-12-07T01:31:39.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To point it out provides a good satirical view but to get this petition signed will only encourage more Christians to get more games banned.
