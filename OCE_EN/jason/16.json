Throughout all the hardships and sacrifice, throughout all the hard work and perseverance. Seeing the boys pull off a stellar performance against LGC in the OPL grand finals was amazing, and the joyous expressions and celebrations from the team were so pure and genuine, you can tell that they had worked for this, aimed for it, and after so long, achieved it.\r\n\r\nOnce the region was finally yours, the world got a whole lot bigger, and competing with North America, China, Europe, and all the other smaller regions became a reality. We know the feelings you felt. Excitement, fear, determination... We know because we were feeling every inch of those feelings with you. However, the one feeling that you had that none of us could relate to, was pressure.\r\n\r\nBrazil, and North America.\r\n\r\nThis was an extremely hard group all things considered. To the left, we had brazilian Team OnE who are an extremely strong team. To the right, Cloud 9, North American veteran team and powerhouse. Realistically, we were aiming for a strong second, even taking a game off Cloud 9 would be an amazing feat, and something to brag about for the rest of the tournament.\r\n\r\nDay one, Dire wolves sat comfortably at 1-1, and all the hype we had was all but verified. We lost to Cloud 9, but destroyed Team OnE in a pretty convincing fashion. Hey, we&#039;re actually standing up to the internationals! Then, while the Dire Wolves licked their wounds, they recomposed. Winning 2-2 was not the plan, they wanted to look at the strongest team there, and draw blood.\r\n\r\nDay two, and ten minutes in, Dire Wolves was in control against American powerhouse Cloud 9, and hype levels were at an all time high. Amazing team coordinations and picks lead to an extensive lead, and the game was then ours to lose. This beautiful moment is one I&#039;ll personally remember for some time, but like all beautiful things, eventually the reality dawned upon us, and the game began to swing back into Cloud 9&#039;s favor. Their experience and sheer coordination dwarfed over our own, even when behind by such a gold deficit, they found a way to claw back and take a victory.\r\n\r\nTo be so close, and to still fall short must be a crushing experience, and quite frankly wouldn&#039;t surprise me if it played into the Dire Wolves minds as they head into their next match. Their next match became their next two matches, as a tiebreaker emerged. Then, Team OnE took down Dire Wolves, ending our run at Worlds 2017.\r\n\r\nRealistically, we&#039;re not a very strong region. It&#039;s not based on our players, or infrastructure, we&#039;ve been at a disadvantage since day 1 purely based off our location, population, and communications network. \r\n\r\nBrazil and America have a base population of over 200 Million. They benefit from the gross population. South Korea has a population of only 50 Million, but their communications network and culture is so much more accustomed that they&#039;re the Esports capital of the world. They can download a 2 hour movie over public wi-fi in less than 30 seconds. That does wonders for player experience and ping numbers. Japan has a population of 140 Million, and due to it&#039;s close border with Korea, they can play on the Korean server on a playable level of ping. Then you&#039;ve got regions like Russia and Taiwan, who are close enough to their international neighbors that they can compete and scrim on the same server, or bootcamp in an international area by catching a bus.\r\n\r\nCompare that to Australia. We&#039;ve got a population of less than 30 Million when you add in the population of New Zealand. From that starting point we&#039;ve already got a large deficit of core players in general. Next up, our infrastructure is heavily outdated, with some of the most expensive, least reliable and slowest internet connections in the world available here due to a poorly maintained and harshly defended copper network connecting our entire country. And as far as our location, it takes almost three hours to fly from the top of Australia to the bottom, longer than that to fly from the west to the east. We&#039;re stuck on a sandy rock with shitty copper and not many people. Let&#039;s face it, we&#039;re not a strong region.\r\n\r\nBut, throughout all of this, we do owe Dire Wolves a Thank you.\r\n\r\nWe get stuck on our island, watching our OPL and comparing our talent to the other regions on a purely hypothetical basis, then two or three times a year, we get the chance to actually clash on the international stage, and compare to others. Dispite the history, dispite the disadvantages, dispite the strength of the other regions, we still, for a week or two, rally behind our boys. All disbelief temporarily on hold, all history irrelevant, all strengths being tested, we come together as a region, with the Australian spirit we&#039;re known for, and live in the moment where we&#039;re not weaker, we&#039;re not at a disadvantage, we&#039;re simply here to put up a fight.\r\n\r\nDire Wolves lost. It&#039;s not realistic to say we were going to win. Hell, making it to the round robin would have been an amazing accomplishment, taking a game off a renouned North American team would have been a beautiful thing to see. But, Dire Wolves lost. On behalf of the entire region, and the pro circuit you represent, we want to say &quot;Thank you.&quot; Your team has grown so much over the last year, topping your region, and competing on an international stage and putting up a hell of a fight. The win over Team OnE on the first day, and the 10 minute lead over Cloud 9, those are the moments that we long for. The moments where we, the underdogs, can look up at the competition, knowing they&#039;re about to throw a punch, and not flinch. The moments where we can stand tall as a region, proud of what we&#039;ve done, and how far we&#039;ve come with so much piled against us.\r\n\r\nYou deserved this chance to represent us, and dispite the result, represented us fantastically.\r\n\r\nSo, Dire Wolves, \r\n\r\n**Thank you.**","replies":[{"poster":"belquin","date":"2017-10-11T23:40:50.876+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well said!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jellytots","date":"2017-10-03T10:42:11.944+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great letter and great post big ups to OCE!","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkSoul1994","date":"2017-10-03T06:13:02.563+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
