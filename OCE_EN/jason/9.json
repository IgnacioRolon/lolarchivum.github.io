Some slight balancing would be needed for new guests and for individual clips, but overall pretty well managed past 5 minutes.\n\n- Visual\nthe transitions between scenes are very default. I'm unsure how you can adjust that, but would make things a bit more fluent.\n\n- Guests\nYour guest choice was alright, I guess..... kek\n\n- Feel\nthe show felt like a strange hybrid of interview and conversation. You could change the dynamic to make it more one than the other, but the balance is a bit off.\n\nOverall, pretty good for a first episode, I look forward to seeing this show change and evolve ( and hopefully not end up like \"OCE Power plays\" did )","replies":[]}]}
