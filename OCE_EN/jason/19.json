Let's discuss","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Short answer; No.**\n\nHey everyone, so there&#039;s been a lot of posts and links for the classic &quot;free rp&quot; scams going around, that involve suspicious downloads, phishy referral links, or convincing log in and claim websites. Now, I know this will dash the hopes and dreams of a lot of you, but these sites are a scam. The worst part is that if people continue to fall for them, people will continue to make them and exploit the gullible and desperate.\n\nBut if you are desperate, and actually smart about it, you can indeed get RP without paying for it. You just gotta be smart. Here&#039;s a few things to check out;\n\n1- eSports ran giveaways\n\nTeams like [Fnatic](https://www.facebook.com/fnatic), [TSM](https://www.facebook.com/TSMPRO/), and a lot closer to home, [Dire Wolves](https://www.facebook.com/DireWolvesGaming/photos/a.699332630154413.1073741828.665177976903212/974530579301282/?type=3&amp;theater), [Chiefs](https://www.facebook.com/chiefsesc/photos/a.631350096972350.1073741827.630804367026923/881391055301585/?type=3&amp;theater), and [Sin Gaming](https://www.facebook.com/SinOceania/photos/a.495875783896409.1073741828.494535370697117/571626246321362/?type=3&amp;theater) to name a few, are doing giveaways to celebrate the Christmas season. _Why?_  Well, doing giveaways is a great practice for teams, as it helps build a community, and drive up their social media numbers. These numbers lead to increased reach, which leads to possible sponsorship, which leads to more giveaways. A cycle that I&#039;m happy to be a part of, if it means I get posts about players and teams that I actually am a fair bit interested in anyway. Sidenote; you might accidentally win a gaming chair or keyboard though, which isn&#039;t RP. If you don&#039;t want a chair or keyboard, I&#039;m sure you could find someone who can make an exchange.\n\n2-  Community ran giveaways\n\nThere&#039;s a lot of amazing communities out there such as [Oceanic Gaming](https://www.facebook.com/OceanicGaming/?fref=ts) and [Summoners Society](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SummonersSocietyOCE/) to name my favorites, and these large communities even sometimes do giveaway throughout the year. It&#039;s not often, but it does happen. You just need to keep a watchful eye out. They have the same reasons to do giveaways as eSports teams, however it&#039;s alot harder for communities to make a profit, so they need all the love and support the can get, even without them freebies being thrown at you.\n\n3- We can make this easy\n\nThere&#039;s an unofficial fan page being ran, exclusively to create and promote giveaways in the OCE scene, [Oceanic LoL Giveaways](https://www.facebook.com/oceanicgiveaways/?fref=ts) ( which I might be a part of ) that finds the more reliable giveaways from around the interwebs, and posts about them. They also run their own independent giveaways, and even have one that&#039;s going on right now, so it&#039;s worth checking out.\n\n4- Grinding it\n\nSo, the last part is only for the desperate and bored that can tick a box that says they&#039;re over 18 and in Australia; [Surveys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r2jJP-K2aE). And I know, surveys kinda suck, and a fair few of them are a scam. I&#039;ve managed to find one that is legitimate. You can tell, because the rewards are realistic. One five minute survey won&#039;t make you rich. You actually have to spend some time filling out these surveys in order for it to credit you. They allow cash out in bank transfer, and in Paypal, which you can use to buy RP. Mission complete.\n\nTo Summarise;\n\nThere&#039;s no such thing as a free meal, someone&#039;s gotta pay for it. If you&#039;re smart, however, it won&#039;t be you.\n\n[~Jason](https://twitter.com/Jason_OCE)","replies":[{"poster":"Hinokio","date":"2015-12-23T12:08:20.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alot of youtubers are giving away rp for this holiday time","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2015-12-22T05:27:04.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"doesn't the bing rewards thing give RP too?","replies":[{"poster":"Jason","date":"2015-12-22T12:15:12.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bing Rewards is exclusive to Americans","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-12-21T22:54:06.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just for arguments sake (not suggesting its a viable source of free RP)\n\nIt isn't exactly a stable income but if you draw a picture or write a creative story, riot will sometimes help you out with small amounts of RP if you're short of getting a skin.\n(not quite free RP because you are paying with a drawing, but its cheaper than real money)","replies":[{"poster":"Jason","date":"2015-12-22T01:08:53.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This isn't something that Riot does commonly, and I've seen people be rejected because they've done it a few times.\n\nTry once or twice, but honestly it'll accumulate to less than 20RP.
