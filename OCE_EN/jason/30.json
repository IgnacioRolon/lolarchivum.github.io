Now first off, you should note that most comments made on this thread are by people that either don&#039;t know anything, or don&#039;t care, and they&#039;re simply having fun with the pitchforks.\r\n\r\nHowever, a lot of good points are raised unfortunately. And this is just ONE of the threads.\r\n\r\nFor anyone who doesn&#039;t know, or has yet to care, basically the players from the OPL team Tainted Minds have had long withstanding issues with the owners and management, which resulted in a gaming house with subpar internet, inferior gaming stations, and no fans or air conditioning during the heat wave from January.\r\n\r\nA lot more details have emerged since, including allegations that Riot OCE&#039;s head of Esports was acting with a conflict of interest while dealing with the Tainted Minds situation.\r\n\r\nUsually on Reddit, we&#039;re not really a common feature. The most notable times OCE has made the top of the reddit have been competitive rulings, the Rich Gang fiasco, and of course Raydere&#039;s retirement. Currently there&#039;s around 5 different threads regarding the Tainted Minds situation. \r\n\r\nThe people are upset that such bad treatment of players has resulted in what most consider a &quot;Minor&quot; fine, that will just go straight to Riot&#039;s pocket, and not compensating the players that have been wrongfully done by.\r\n\r\nI&#039;d suggest doing ample research on statements made by the players, as well as statements given by Riot, and see if you can form your own opinion before posting hard about what side you sit on. \r\n\r\nIt is rather upsetting to see OCE once again being made the joke of League of Legends Esports. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-04-14T08:48:31.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Who are Tainted Minds?
