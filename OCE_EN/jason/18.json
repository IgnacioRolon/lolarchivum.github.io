It was fine last night - only noticed it half an hour ago when I played my warm up ARAM game.\n\nEdit: General issue with the client seems to be that things are generally loading very, very slowly or not at all - it's not just ranked role select for me.

Are you still having client issues at this time?\n\nBeen at PAX the last few days, and working before that, so I can't give a definitive answer. I believe there was a patch recently, it may have included some bug fixes, as there's nothing to report after one game ( or I haven't noticed / encountered them )\n\nwill update if I find them again.\n\nEdit; https://gyazo.com/3a48d1e56a77a9f97f7f8e33d1ad4039\n\nAfter a game was remade, the post-game lobby failed to load for a LONG time, and by the time I got in, everyone else had loaded, talked, and left.\n\nI had enough time to NOTICE it was taking forever, open up gyazo, make that 5 second snap, and then when it finished I counted to 28 before it finally loaded. So probably just under a minute.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-10-31T12:36:08.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When was this GIF taken?
