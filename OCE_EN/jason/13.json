I&#039;m the creator of such weirdly good but kinda crappy videos as [How Do: Jhin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsNfdgPwpa8), and [I am tank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnTdYVvO89s).\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve started up a group called Creative Summoners Union, with the intention of getting people who want to create to join together and support each other. As an incentive, I&#039;ve decided that I want to start teaching people the basics, and some other features of Video Editing using one of the more popular programs, Sony Vegas Pro.\r\n\r\nTo register your interest, join the CSU Discord server; https://discord.gg/UpepN8N\r\n\r\nOh, and obviously it&#039;s free. See you there!","replies":[{"poster":"Myxthio","date":"2016-10-20T03:24:51.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'mma take a little look at it. Curious to see how you edit and the capabilities of Sony Vegas Pro. Sadly I'm too poor to afford that software so I'm stuck with iMovie but I'm decent at editing. My vids can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSnMLdsDQ8Gd9-QvDw8ETxg) if you're interested. Myxthio's the name, and comedy is my game. Well... technically the game is LoL but I'm good with comedy too.\n\nAnd I'm curious to know how exactly you build Jhin. Crits for days and speed ups? Or the Armour Pen build my friend constantly tries to shove down my throat? Or is it something a bit custom?","replies":[{"poster":"Jason","date":"2016-10-21T17:16:50.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SkeletorTheMyaah,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=OIooYsIB,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-10-20T03:24:51.584+0000)\n> And I&#x27;m curious to know how exactly you build Jhin. \n\n\nFull movement speed crits.\n\nMovespeed runes, stormraiders surge, Phantom dancer, Rapidfire cannon, and just ZOOM around those fights.","replies":[{"poster":"Myxthio","date":"2016-10-23T23:45:48.942+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I forgot to leave my comment here, so i'll do it now.\n\nOoooooo~ Speedy maskmin.

That's it.\n\nAs for DaVinci Resolve, I only have one friend who uses it, and it's only because he does a lot of color correction.

Check out DaVinci resolve. It's free software, industry standard for color grading. Still not the best linear editing software but its improving a heap. Also much better than imovie","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jason","date":"2016-10-15T08:44:53.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bumpin up again :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jason","date":"2016-10-13T17:13:23.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gonna bump this if it lets me.
