Flash - This summoner spell totally breaks the game. One champ with flash can literally become a nightmare requiring 3-5 people to control. The ability to have getaways and gap-closers should be specific to certain champs not ALL champs.\r\n\r\n2. Q, W and E abilities being able to completely negate one and possible even more R abilities. This is ridiculous. You mean to say a skill that costs 40 mana is more powerful that one that costs 100+ mana?? The only time a R ability should be negated should be by another R ability OR and item (Edge of Night, Banshee&#039;s Veil or Zonyas). Shit like Windwall and Unbreakable are pure bullshit blocking pretty much any projectile R ability.\r\n\r\n3. Teleporting to minions - This is just so over powered. Teleport should pretty much only apply to Stealth wards, Control wards, Towers and Inhibitors.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-11-10T11:03:27.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are issues with balance in League but you just listed the 3 worst examples, well done.","replies":[{"poster":"Ugandan Bruce U","date":"2017-12-02T11:27:43.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fitzky,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=FqA3g3Eu,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-11-10T11:03:27.420+0000)\n>\n> There are issues with balance in League but you just listed the 3 worst examples, well done.\n\nLol alot of people don't agree. But from a mathematical standpoint these are major issues","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Emit","date":"2017-09-26T03:52:13.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1: The game is already balanced around flash, so its too late to change that part.\n\n2: Its called counterplay, you see a yas/fiora with w still up? Then don't throw everything into them, if you do its your fault for being an idiot.\n\n3: Teleport has already been nerfed several times, its in a fine spot now, you have a 4.5 second notice of the person coming in, to be honest this all just seems like some low elo player complaining about things they don't understand so they must be op.","replies":[{"poster":"Ugandan Bruce U","date":"2017-11-10T10:26:24.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. The game was already balanced around masteries and they changed those.\n\n2. You can't counterplay vs projectile speed. You may fire your ulti as a ashe or jinx and be windwalled or unbreakabled after firing it. I've literally seen that save an entire team from being pentakilled. That is not balanced. And you still didn;t explain how that justifies the mana cost difference. If I have a move that has a cd of 1 minute and a cost of 200 manna and one champ can counter it with a move that costs 20 manna and has a 10 second cool down how is that balanced?\n\n3. The teleport duration is not what I stated was the issue. I stated that the ability to teleport to a minion was broken. You failed to ready the questions accurately and decided to instead be condescending and arrogant instead of approaching them with an opened mind.","replies":[]}]}]}
