IF wait time is 5 min you&#039;re likely going to go make a coffee or something. but then it procs early and u miss it. Ths happens afew times and 5 min ban. A few more and 30 min ban. You can&#039;t guarantee an EXACT TIME so we&#039;re stuck with this huge 5 minute window where we could possibly be in game at any time meaning we have to sit and stare at your stupid launcher like dumb apes until it pings matchmade.\r\n\r\nThis is just too extreme. I am not waiting with League of Legends open for half an hour to play one match. I have a life and I have more important things to do. \r\n\r\nRIOT if you can&#039;t guarantee instant matchmaking or at least exact times, then don&#039;t impose huge penalties for people if they get bored or distracted by other things waiting for the 5+ min proc. A lot can happen in 5 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"Ugandan Bruce U","date":"2016-12-25T03:40:34.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"uninstalling yet again since it took me 10 min to write this and i refuse to wait another 20 so I'm going to play something better.","replies":[]}]}
