These are the reasons:\n\na) what determines if your team wins or loses is often totally nothing to do wit your individual skill. I&#039;ve seen a dude score s+ on a losing team - he had 5 turrents &amp; 1 inhib. but cos his team was total trash they lost &amp; guess what.. he lost LP. That shit is not fair Riot. It is also the primary reason i&#039;ve seen a prearranged team of bronzies who&#039;d been bronze for a year beat a prearranged silver team. The silver team fully admitted they&#039;d been out played &amp; also agreed the enemy team didn&#039;t deserve to be bronze. They played 3 games &amp; the bronzies lost NONE! The silvers were simply totally outplayed.\n\nb) One guy strategically feeding can throw an entire game &amp; cos all that counts is win or lose. you STILL get penalized loss of L regardless of if action is taken against him from reports made. I&#039;e seen a guy feed different lanes under the disguise of tryign to help &amp; just beig a bad player. he did it for 3 months to prove a point. NO ACTION WAS TAKEN AGAINST HIM!\n\nc) Someone who is just plain BAD at LoL should also be on low priority list not just the abusive &amp; non cooperative people. Som3eone who is just plain BAD shouldn&#039;t even be ABLE to play ranked. Since they ruin it for other players in bronze who actually know what they are doing.\n\nMy solutions.\n\n1) LP should be based PRIMARILY on POSITION objectives NOT win or loss ALONE. Win or Loss should simply provide a bonus LP NOT all of it. i.e Chaps get will get LP based on\n\nSupport : wards placed or destroyed per minute or w/e based on CD. Assists. Shields, Heals resurrects &amp; buffs. CC on targets.\n\nADC: CS. Kill to death Ratio. Assists. Towers/Inibs Detroyed.\n\nJungle : Neutral minion kills. Assists. Wards destroyed or placed.\n\nMid : Kills. Assists. Total Damage done.\n\nTop : Towers/inhibs defended. Assists. Total Damage taken.\n\n2)  Match making should be fixed so that each position has it&#039;s own rank based on your prior performance in that position. that way for bottom lane if you are good at support you know you&#039;ll be put with someone equally as good at adc BASED on your past games as both support &amp; adc respectively. This also applies to the rest of the team. \n\n3) It is impossible to truly know if someone is feeding or just plain bad unless they specifically state that intention in chat.. There needs to be alot more movement in ranking up &amp; down. win 3/5 games u rank up. lose 4/5 games u rank down. Also we need more than 5 ranks. Double that would make more sense.  Like add Grass &gt; Wood &gt; Stone&gt; Iron&gt; Steel?\n\nThis is based on what I&#039;ve seen &amp; a lot of comments from bronzies &amp; silvers over the past year. Don&#039;t hate on me lol","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-06-05T00:11:54.314+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey summoner,\n\nI think you're just misunderstanding what League is as a game. \n_**I'll try and explain this a bit:**_\n\n+ _LP should be based PRIMARILY on POSITION objectives NOT win or loss ALONE._\n\n Here's the problem. \n\n Many players think that **Good KDA=Win**, so when you loose on an awesome KDA you feel like the system cheated you. After all, you did everything needed for a win right? Why didn't you get it?\n\n Remember the main objective in League is not CS, kills, Dragons, Barons or technically even turrets. The main objective in League is to kill the nexus, and right now our ranked system rewards people who are good at that.\n\n Your system will legitimately change the game. League will no longer be about killing the Nexus and winning, but rather getting good KDA's and objectives.\n\nIf this is what you think is best then that's fine, but keep in mind a majority of the player base would be against this. Not to mention **Riot** has specifically said they [do not support it](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide#q2).\n\n> **League is a team game.** \n> \n> If you want to win the game you must work together. Sometimes you'll take a loss because of your team, other times you'll steal a win you didn't deserve because your team carried you. This is how team games work, players support each other and pick up the slack to cover up mistakes and weaknesses.\n> \n> Don't get me wrong, League does reward mechanically skilled players, but they still need to work as a team to win. If you don't like this then play a purely skill based solo game; Chess, Tennis, Super Smash, Starcraft etc... \n\n> _**A great KDA shows you can carry yourself. A great KDA and win ratio shows you can carry a team.**_ \n\nI hope this helped.","replies":[{"poster":"Ugandan Bruce U","date":"2016-06-05T00:40:17.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you don't get objectives you won't win the game. if you don't defend towers, kill towers, have visibility, get kills, etc; ALL OF THIS goes toward nexus kill, often EVEN MORE than just a simple auto attack of a nexus.

If you go on a losing streak like that you're MMR is going to go down, so of course your rank is also going to be affected by that.
