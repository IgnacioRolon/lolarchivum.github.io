First thing I noticed is Ancient Coin & Spellthief's Edge are remarkably better than Relic Shield. \n\n* In 30 sec, at most, you make 24 gold and you hit extra 30 damage with Spellthief but the risk factor trying to land spells to basic attacks makes this item less viable as an early game item. \n* In 30 sec, at most, you make 69 gold and give the same to an ally as well as heal them 40hp with Relic Shield but this is easier to land than spellthief. \n* With Ancient Coin you can make a GUARANTEED 21 gold and heal yourself for 30hp with a ridiculous amount less risk. \n\nFinal items bonus:\n\n* Spellthief's becomes Frost Queen&'s Claim and sends out 2 Ghosts that grant Visibility and  Movement Speed of enemies hit by 40% for 5 seconds (60 second cooldown.) This means this item is a strong late game sup item.\n* Ancient Coin becomes Talisman of Ascension and grants allies around +40% movement speed for 3 seconds (60 second cooldown) (600 range) This is also a strong late game item but has a higher risk factor due to reduced visibility and no tenacity, armor, mag res or hp bonuses.\n* Relic Shield becomes Face of the Mountain and grants an ally 10% of your maximum Health for 4 seconds. (60 second cooldown). This item is ridiculous for late game as it requires the sup to HP tank ass opposed to tenacity, armor & mag res tank. This is remarkably Item dependent as opposed to the other two supp items.\n\nMy recommended fixes would be:\n\n* Change item recipe for Face of the Mountain to Ruby Crystal - Giant belt instead of Kindlegem and change Face of the Mountain's 450hp to 800hp and up the price accordingly. \n* Change Frost Queen's Claims +50 ability power to +55 magic resistance, Frostfangs +15 ability power to +35 magic resistance and Spellthief's Edge +5 ability power to 10 magic resistance. Change build item Fiendish Codex to Negatron Cloak.\n\nALSO.. Item Idea\n\nEnchanted Tether\n\n* Stats: 5% Move speed. +5 ability power.
