This is of course no easy task for a solo player which means only the most dedicated will even play ranked since it has to be unlocked by a) playing as all champs or b) having played against or with all champs. Not every player deserves to be playing ranked. it shouldn&#039;t be open to the plebs in general. Just like zones in most mmorpgs are level specific.\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nThe requirement to play a ranked game is win &#039;X&#039; amount of normal games first. this would also kill a lot of the toxicity you see in most ranked matches.","replies":[]}
