If he got a good rework he could not be so bad and actually be a good champ. I have thought of a few ideas for his new abilities that i thought would be good. I tried to make him a good jungler because i feel that is where he performed best. Let me know what you think and if any changes could be done to help.\r\n\r\nPassive - Bloodshed (essentially his toggled off w) \r\nAatrox has a bar of &#039;Bloodshed&#039; that builds up to 100. When a damaging ability is landed on a champion/monster/minion he gains 10 &#039;Bloodshed&#039; (each hit with a Q counts). When the &#039;Bloodshed&#039; bar is full, every third attack heals Aatrox for 5% of max. health (+25% of max. Damage). &#039;Bloodshed&#039; will disappear after 10 seconds after being out of combat, losing 10 &#039;Bloodshed&#039; every second until bar is depleted.\r\n(No Cool down)\r\n\r\nQ - Darkins Thrust\r\nAatrox will thrust towards a selected enemy dealing damage and slowing the enemy for 3 seconds\r\nSlow - 25% of enemies max movement speed\r\n(No Cost)\r\n70/105/160/230/265 (+100% attack damage)\r\n\r\nW - (needs a name)\r\nAfter Aatrox activates this ability, his basic attacks will essentially cleave for the next 10 seconds and will deal damage to any enemy he hits while attacking. His attack will deal 45% less damage to minions/monsters/champions (that are hit with the cleave) than his max. Damage but full damage to his selected target for his basic attack.\r\n(No Cost)\r\n\r\nE - (needs a name)\r\nAatrox will draw blood from his enemies within a radius healing himself for half the damage done to all enemies (up to 6 enemies can be hit) with a build up of 5 seconds.\r\n(No Cost) \r\n45/60/100/145/170 (+80% ability power)\r\n\r\nR - The Darkins Power\r\n(Can only be activated when under 35% health)\r\nAatrox will send out a force dealing magic damage to enemies within a radius and fearing them for 2 seconds. Aatrox&#039;s &#039;Bloodshed&#039; bar will fill completely and will gain 45% extra attack speed. If Aatrox dies while this is activated he will be revived losing his &#039;Bloodshed&#039; and extra attack speed, but he will be heal for the amount of damage taken in the last 10 seconds\r\n(No Cost)\r\n210/265/340 (+100% magic damage)\r\n\r\nHis build will be like a attack speed/ tank (BotRK and Spirit Visage or something).\r\n\r\nI think this could be a rework that could put Aatrox back in the game and actually be liked, although i may need to change some of the damage dealt from abilities just in case its a little to much.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-02-22T11:39:47.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He isn't forgotton,, they have a large scale rework planned for him in 2018, and a smaller minirework to tide him over somewhere around midyear\n\nand his his q a thrust like yasuo q or a dash like old fiora q??","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-02-22T04:51:35.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is actually a fairly decent rework :) It makes him feel more like the 'demon wardlord god' that he's supposed to be, GJ.

Similarly there are also many legit reasons why his kit is pretty hard to balance without a rework or at least a mini-one to change things up a bit. So personally, I don't believe trying to come up with a way to fix him through rework is such a bad idea.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-02-21T09:56:13.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"EDIT: scrap what I said.\n\nMake this Q allow Aatrox to skillshot dash forward in a line and possibly slowing all targets caught within the path, give W some innate lifesteal from the cleave (half on minions and monsters), and maybe rebalance/redesign the passive (and its interaction with R, or the rest of the kit), then it's all good.","replies":[]}]}
