His passive would be when in the river he would be slowed by 10% but gain 20% armour. his q would be throw ham at the enemy that makes them lose 10 armour and 10 magic resist and make them take some dmg. his w would be him taking a bit of himself and eating it to heal but takes away 1 armour each time but when he goes back to base he regains his original armour. the e would be him flopping onto of an enemy and snaring them for a few seconds with him aswell. his r would be him splitting himself into 5 little sandwichs that when he uses an ability all his sandwichs do the same abiltiy so it would be x5 dmg for the ability if it hits.","replies":[{"poster":"wallah fight me","date":"2015-06-26T20:16:47.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot won't make this, he's bread... \n","replies":[{"poster":"Lonely Flame","date":"2015-06-27T13:44:34.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your champ is average at best.
