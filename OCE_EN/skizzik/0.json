They'll have to ask you a series of questions to help verify you're the original account user, you shouldn't need to answer all of them, just enough to prove beyond any reasonable doubt (any info about the account not accessible through Riot or 3rd party services will help).\n\nIdeally they'll be able to verify you as the original account user and deal with any punishments that have occurred due to the compromise, however it may be harder for them to do so considering you haven't played in a while (it means less recent data about you to help them). You might also want to consider checking any important accounts (banks, emails etc) for security, particularly any using the same email as your LoL account, just in case. You can also check out the website https://haveibeenpwned.com/ as it is a great resource to help track down any compromises.","replies":[]}]}
