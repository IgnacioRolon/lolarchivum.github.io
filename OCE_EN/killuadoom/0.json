It also helps to include the word \"bot\" in the \"comments\" box when submitting the report, as the system will automatically understand that.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that bots (and third-party software in general) are generally banned in waves, rather than on an \"as soon as possible\" basis like other types of offences. The exception to that is any bot account at or over level 30, in which case your best option to report them would likely be by submitting a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (choose the \"I want to report abusive behaviour, cheating, or a malicious link\" option) to ensure they're dealt with swiftly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PLAYER47","date":"2018-06-29T16:43:37.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KilluaDoom,realm=EUW,application-id=mR0UmRrp,discussion-id=bcJaiTLL,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-06-29T16:05:39.588+0000)\n>\n> I have suffered from playing with botters beside my team actually i always playing against players who puts botters beside my team\n\nI think it falls under cheating.\nix.
