I have a solid knowledge of the game however i feel i can only further this knowledge by assisting a ranked 5&#039;s team.  This is my first time attempting something like this so the first few weeks could be rough but i am committed to giving the best available data and analysis i can.I could attempt to take on a coach role if someone is interested, however being only Bronze 2 my mechanics are pretty terrible. Please dont let my rank scare you, i don&#039;t play ranked to often and my game knowledge is superior to that of my mechanics. If your interested please add my account &quot;JanitorDreams&quot; so we can talk further. \r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Realm","date":"2015-10-12T10:39:54.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I added you in game mate from my recruitment post. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Topsy","date":"2015-10-12T10:25:18.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, my team and I are interested in having an analyst to deconstruct our play as a team, maybe even take on a sort of coach type role. We just recently finished a tournament and have decided that we would like a bit more help with making us a better team. We are hoping to find someone that isn't just looking to do ranked que as we are interested in entering as many tournaments as possible because we enjoy the competition. That is why we are interested in you. Hopefully you are interested in working with us, we aren't all super good at the game, most of us are below gold although there is one plat player, this is why we would love to have someone like yourself to help us improve our play. I have sent you a request so we can talk about this more if you are interested. \n\nThanks for your time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-10-12T08:15:23.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol i know the feels, but at this stage not even being silver is gonna be a huge turnoff, not to mention im sure lots of people are trying to be coaches/analysts of their favourite game. a lot of the times its usually just the same coaches of the pro teams moving around to different teams since they already have experience and may have proven to be effective coaches already so its gonna be pretty much impossible for new people to get into the scene let alone anyone who dont have above average thorough statistical proof of their knowledge (their rank, since being diamond means you definitely know something about the game, right off the bat)","replies":[{"poster":"Janitor Dreams","date":"2015-10-12T08:48:10.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im more just trying to get onto 5v5 ranked team, i just want to break down their games and just see whether i like it or not. I know at this stage no actual professional team would take me, thats why i want to join some ranked 5 teams. Hopefully with experience from that people will take me more seriously. thanks for the advice though im going to try and climb to silver over the weeks now","replies":[]}]}]}
