I understand that I cannot remove it under any circumstances, but is there any way to reduce the harshness of Leaverbuster in future punishments? That is, **is there something I can do to reduce the Low Priority Queue timer the next time I am punished, so the timer does not continue to increase past 20 minutes?**\r\n\r\nThanks for the help.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-08-16T06:54:07.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be clear, the LPQs given by leaverbuster are capped at 20 minutes (stated in the FAQ, link below). I'm a bit unsure as to what actually happens to someone who continues to leave after receiving the 20 minute LPQ, and will ask around to make sure I get the correct information for you (as far as I'm aware, it would either result in additional 20 minute LPQs *or* escalate to a 14-day suspension/ban). As for \"improving your standing\", that should occur over significant time so long as you play withing the rules. Instances of leaving games will count against your account (evidently), while maintaining a reliable connection over several months will help towards improving the standing of your account, and should subsequently drop you back through the punishment tiers over time. You can find more information regarding Leaverbuster on the [Leaverbuster FAQ Support Page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714) (though it doesn't state punishment tiers beyond 20 minute LPQ, for some reason).","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-08-16T23:03:48.271+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, so I've had a chat with some of the volunteers/Rioters involved with the volunteer program and from that I've learnt that once you hit the 20 minute LPQ it will continue to repeat the 20 minute LPQ if you continue to leave often enough for LeaverBuster to trigger. Basically, you shouldn't have to worry about a 14-day or permanent ban as a result of the \"varying circumstances\" you've mentioned. As far as we can determine, the number of games per LPQ penalty doesn't increase (so it will be given in groups of 5), but that is not something we're completely certain about.\n\nI didn't mention it in my earlier post, but the LeaverBuster FAQ does direct players to the Troubleshooting Connection Issues Support Page for crashing/disconnecting games, which you may want to consider looking at if you're having such issues. If you're having issues with and/or as a result of your ISP, then obviously your best bet would be to get in touch with them and try and sort it out like that (I know they can be a massive f*cking pain to deal with, but if these are persistent issues you'd likely be better off sorting it out sooner rather than later). If you're having other issues, I may or may not have some advice/information for that, at the very least I could ask around and see if someone who could help can pop in and discuss the issue(s) with you.\n\nHope all of this has been informative and helpful. Good luck.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}
