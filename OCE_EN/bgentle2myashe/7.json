So I restarted, did system recovery, checked my system for errors and called my isp to do a connection check. Everything on my end was fine. I gave it a few days rest and it stopped. Then it&#039;s started up again today. I did the most recent update today so idk if that has anything to do with it but atm this game is unplayable for me and I&#039;m almost certainly convinced it&#039;s something to do with the client. Even before the game started my pre-match lobby chat lagged. Does anyone know of a current bug or something in the client regarding getting timed out?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-07-27T06:50:39.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you please do the following for me;\n\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP.
