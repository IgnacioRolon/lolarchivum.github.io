But what about the supports and or tanks? \r\nNow that more damage is being dealt everyone is dying more. Obviously the supports and tanks are going to cop it the most because it is their job. It was hard enough in competitive games for supports and or tanks to get good scores and rewards before all these updates but now it is becoming less and less possible. It is common sense that for a tank or support to setup plays and or bait enemies in they have to put themselves at risk. If you take into account the amount of times that risk does not pay off and you get caught out the odds are not in you&#039;re favor whether you are experienced and confident in you&#039;re role or not. This is the point I&#039;m trying to make. More risk and less reward.\r\nI really don&#039;t like where this is leading league of legends because the fun really is coming out of the game. So much less skill based and more masteries, runes and item based. \r\nMaybe I am just ranting and over thinking this, but I do think irregardless there should be some sought of system for tanks and or supports that rewards them based on something other than K/D/A. A player can have a terrible k/d/a and still have been the most relevant player in the game. More than likely they are going to be a support or tank.\r\nExamples could be: \r\nHitting a high percentage of hooks or skill shots to setup plays.\r\nConsistently taking less damage in team fights or dying less than the other players/team.\r\nConsistently taking the most damage in team fights and or surviving particularly if you&#039;re tank.\r\nSaving other players lives even if you sacrificed you&#039;re own.\r\nStealing enemy buffs particularly the epic monsters. Like in team fights over the dragon or baron and you smite steal or ability steal it,\r\nand so on\r\nWhether these and or others are possible implementations that can be added into the system to make a more detailed rating for all situations or not, the point is I feel like it can be revised and more things added to make all roles equally relevant and rewarded as per the job detail is required. \r\nPlease support my theory and or make you&#039;re own suggestions. As a support and tank main maybe I am biased but I can only hope there are more of you out there that feel the same.","replies":[{"poster":"MasochistSupMain","date":"2016-05-26T00:07:08.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mate, League of Legends game doesn't give scores based only on KDA.\nA few days ago I've played a 4v5 game where my team had an Ahri AFK, we lost and I ended up with a 11/08/10 KDA (which is pretty bad) and still got an S (not even a S-).\n\nI'm not sure what it takes into account, but is not only your KDA at the end of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-05-27T22:48:08.222+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"most damage, most cs, best kda, most healing (needs to be more than most damage), all give an s- default, getting more than 1 ups it","replies":[]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-05-26T05:38:35.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And yet i get 1-3-21 as a support and I get A.

You aren't against every other support champion, you are against every other player playing that champion in that specific ROLE. So comparing two different champions is pointless. If you didn't get an S- or higher it's because the average baseline score for that champion in that role is a lot higher than what you got.\n\nThis is why if you want to cheese the system you play a champion outside of it's intended role. I can play Elise top and 9.9/10 times I will easily get an S without even trying all that hard. Take her into the jungle however and it is a totally different ball game.\n\nOr another way is to play the unplayed champions for easy chests. I don't play adc, I honestly hate it and the only one I play is MF who, at this point in time, is garbage tier adc. I go 11/0 and get an S+. I THEN go 3/8.

I don't feel it is so much as a role in it's own right that people are excited about. I don't feel that supports and or tanks get the same rewards as the other roles. I believe that's a large reason why people bring control mage's and or adc's into the top lane. Yes, sometimes the team comp desires a second mage or adc and is designed that way. Mostly though, tanks and supports only get assists and or peel right? Control mage's and adc's do damage and get kills/cs therefor are more relevant in it's own right and are rewarded as such.","replies":[{"poster":"RUSTYtheCASTER","date":"2016-05-26T06:07:10.430+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They've never had the same rewards though my friend, and that's where the disparity may lie with your thoughts!\nTo give you the plain and simple, both roles rarely get kills. Kills are the name of the game for most players and as such these two roles feel the brunt of that. \nYou've stated this fact so let me elaborate, the kills is the satisfaction players receive, as though their efforts can be immediately rewarded. The nitty gritty is the Sup role, ward placement etc, setting your team up for success.\n\nFor what it's worth I believe Support is in a great spot at the moment, there's a definite dynamic between what beats what and there is generally speaking diversity. Marksman directly impact the Support role however, and with a lack of change available there, perhaps the perception of what a Support can look like is directly altered?\n\nAs a Diamond 1 support player myself, I feel endless satisfaction with the role. Kills don't mean as much and I feel accomplished getting my team ahead.

That is my point though, for all the things that have taken focus and are priority, I feel like supports and tanks are a forgotten role. Again I'll illiterate my point is not in relevance in the game because they are hugely important in their own right, but rather as to receive the same reward and acknowledgement as the other roles. Whether this is just having a whinge or not, I just feel like why reward half the participants of a game for their efforts but not the rest? If you equally participate and fulfill  you're role as designed but not in the aesthetically pleasing way, there should still be a part of the system that rewards you.","replies":[{"poster":"me run mid","date":"2016-05-27T19:46:13.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not quite sure what you mean regarding the tanks.

Robotic if you like, but welcome to the meta.\n\nMaybe instead of being support, you might like to try the top lane with some tanks like Gragas, Fizz, Ekko, Trundle, Poppy, or Maokai? In the competitive play, these are the only 6 champions being selected at the moment.

My point still remains that there is very little reward for the risks taken considering how important the roles are. Tanks and supports go unnoticed by default unless you play a perfect game which isn't that common. \nI am very confident in my support and top lane knowledge, awareness and general ability but if I get stunned once there is no 2nd chance and it's so easy to snow ball with the way the meta is, one mistake and that's game. That's a little over-exaggerated but even if you take into account for example how many assists does a support need to get to make up for 1 death. Compared with an adc or mid lane it's a lot less because they get the kills which gives more money and has a bigger effect on the game. \nBest case scenario my point is you get no reward for a great game with ok stats. Imagine though, if that was just the normal for most games? Is that still a best case scenario compared with another role that had an average game but great stats and they get rewarded by default?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-05-27T22:44:59.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its because they focus the game around professional play, even though that has no relevance to casual players, other than exhausting the fun out of the game","replies":[]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2016-05-27T05:31:26.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like to think that Supports simply Augment their team - making their team slightly stronger in one area, or supplement an already-strong area.\n\nThey don't have to Tank, they don't have to engage.\n\nSometimes a Blitzcrank should be hooking a squishy every time they show their face.
