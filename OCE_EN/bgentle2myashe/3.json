Is there an ability for ranked 5 teams to challenge another team to a ranked game directly? If not is that ability at all an option for the future? Also would it be possible to create an option to rank against a friend in the same way you can duo with them? Just for the sake of improving with someone you know well at your own level, rather than the current broken mmr system.","replies":[{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-07-25T06:39:26.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would be abused for free elo","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-25T06:49:17.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok yeah fair enough.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-07-25T12:06:39.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Freelo is the reason this isn't a thing. \n\nIf you really want to challenge ranked 5s teams directly, just add players from the games you have played (as ranked 5s) and ask if they would mind playing customs vs your team some time. You could even set up a low elo scrim chat is discord, where captains of the low elo teams can set up custom vs each other.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
