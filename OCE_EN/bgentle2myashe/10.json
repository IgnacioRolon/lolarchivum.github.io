So I have 2 questions: \n\n1. Am I legitimately supposed to wait for all people higher on the rankings list to make their picks before me? I have never heard of or seen that before and nor would I expect anyone to do it for me.\n2. Is it a re-portable offence to take \"someone elses\" item or champion or pick a champion before them on the carousel? My sister seems to think it is and continues to report people for it regularly. Please help, Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-09-18T06:53:22.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Am I legitimately supposed to wait for all people higher on the rankings list to make their picks before me?

There is no waiting, just going in and getting what you need/want. \n\n>Is it a re-portable offence to take \"someone elses\" item or champion or pick a champion before them on the carousel?

The carousel is the equaliser, the chance for those who are behind to catch up by getting the priority picks. \n\nIf anything, it's bad manners for her to expect you to wait for her to get an item you need more, and that will probably get taken by someone else in the in-between if you don't take it anyway.\n\nYou're *meant* to be taking other people's champions items from the carousel (assuming there isn't anything you want more) because it's a competitive game-mode that you are trying to win *individually*.","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-09-23T00:06:11.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you.
