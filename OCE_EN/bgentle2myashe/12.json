Don&#039;t know how to post the screen shot. Or should I just send it to riot directly or has the remake rules changed?","replies":[{"poster":"Dota3iscoming","date":"2016-07-21T12:38:41.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol They changed it so that first blood won't count cause some cheeky people cause easily go 5 bot get first blood and remake won't go through that's why they changed it to if someone is AFK and it hits 3 min you can remake doesn't matter what happens in between. Though honestly it should be changed to if someone is afk for more than 3 min at anytime of the game you should be able to remake or get a loss prevented cause someone could wait till the 3 min mark then afk and your basically screwed","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-22T07:09:16.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a very good point too.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"proMINscuous","date":"2016-07-21T10:10:35.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think as long as someone hasn't connected, remake goes ahead even with first blood.","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-21T10:30:55.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh ok nvm.

They get to choose and an advantage. Someone could legit afk for 5 minutes team gets first blood and you come back but if you don't get first blood then the team remakes. That's worst Riot call 2016 imo!","replies":[]}]}]}
