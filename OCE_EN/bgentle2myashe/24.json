Normally when I have a bad game or start having a losing streak I&#039;ll smash out some bots games just to get some wins on the board which some what helps but not enough.  Then yesterday I met a guy on boards who is a little bit less experienced than me and still learning more advanced concepts of the game. I suggested to him we go play some 1v1 and practice drills just to help him out. After having 3-4 drill games every game I&#039;ve played since we have snow balled 20 minute games. \r\nIt&#039;s been a few weeks since I have won more than 2 games in a row let alone snow balled games. So my theory is that when you have a bad game and get severely out traded that something in the coding is taken into account for future games until you do the same to someone else. Maybe it&#039;s just me and no one else has experienced this but it&#039;s not the first time it&#039;s happened to me so I was just curious if anyone knows anything about it?","replies":[{"poster":"Belrick","date":"2016-07-24T08:37:52.246+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riots matching making is made by retards for the purpose of fooling a stupid player base. Its friggen disgusting how bad it is.\n\"oh you have won three games in a row AS SUPPORT!!#$%^#$#!!! therefor you can carry so... Next game your B5 Mid top and bot will be paired vs. plat5.\n\nFU**KING $(*#^(*$^ DOI!!!!! , its that bad.\n\nSick of it, friggen sick of, winning close games, yay fun, lose a close game, yay fun, win streak... uh oh. FUK. Incompetent should be playing vs. bots team mates coming up courtesy of Riot retards inc.\n\nI suspect the main culprit is the drive to save costs and reduce wait times. So coding by min wage immigrants who last coded in VBA.","replies":[{"poster":"Belrick","date":"2016-07-24T08:39:10.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ps: Dear Riot, Supports can't carry.
