More importantly, if this is a defensive build on a natural tank champion and I&#039;m not even relevant what can I possibly do to be relevant with any other build????? \nI have 12 magic resist runes and grasp of the undying mastery, yet he does the full amount of damage possible to me?\nNasus vs Ryze top lane\n130+ damage done at lvl 1 with one q and two auto&#039;s\n300+ damage done at lvl 3 with what I assume was spell flux and one auto which triggered thunderlords. \nMy runes, masteries and items: http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/139776937/201591945?tab=builds&amp;participant=2\nHIs runes, masteries and items: http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/139776937/201591945?tab=builds&amp;participant=9\n\nAll I want is to have half a chance at playing the game and enjoying it without getting wasted by random amounts of damage. Furthermore, If someone can clarify for me what difference a rank should have on the amount of damage done to you during game. For example this Ryze is silver 3 and I am bronze 4 so does that mean he has an automatic advantage over me?","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-10T10:49:18.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So as it turns out, that Ryze was a gold 3. Then 2 games later i played a platinum 2 Teemo. The same thing happened and got bagged all game for being \"bad\". So I'm not sure how this coding system is supposed to allow new players or lower ranked players climb and get better since there is 100% an advantage to the higher elo player. But hey, I'm just a life bronze member given it seems the system is groomed to keep me low =-((.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Level1Pentakill","date":"2016-07-09T13:44:19.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EnHZX44o_Q","replies":[{"poster":"Level1Pentakill","date":"2016-07-09T13:53:38.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Early Gamers are good vs Ryze. Nasus can't really do much. Probably one of the worst matchups you could take to be honest.\n\nThink: Spell shields still being semi useless if you can't bully him out of lane.\n\nHe used to be worse. They're re-working him next patch.\n\nHis Q is a skillshot so stand behind minions. Plus uhh.. his E shreds ur MR. So if you're standing with just him and yourself - it will bounce between you and him rather than around units and can shred ur MR down to nothing in these situations so try to fight him in minion waves and other than that, take an earlier game Champ. Riven can shred him but even she is vulnerable to his kit (Lockdown combo) Kennen is an all around uncounterable laner (Along with Nidalee and Lee Sin he doesn't really have counterplay but is a great top laner) and if you play well you can usually shut down a Ryze.\n\nHe has no waveclear so pushers can be good too - but be careful because once he's past 6 - if a Jungler comes you will probably get chased down and demolished by him. Even solo if you let him catch u out or he decides to all-in his burst is pretty insane so play safe but play aggressive.","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-10T06:47:04.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thanks, I guess. Not that it doesn't help but I'm really so salty at riot for ruining this game. I can stack MR all day long and it has no effect apparently. Then on top of that, a pathetic attempt at, \"expressing yourself\" as they call it through mastery key stone (thunderlords) which is triggered by 1 spell and 1 auto for Ryze. This game is 100% biost towards burst and damage dealers and anyone who doesn't play dominant champions bad luck.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
