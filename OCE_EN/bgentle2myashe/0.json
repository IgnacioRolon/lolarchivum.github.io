In most cases I hold my lane and end even on stats if not positive. \r\nRecently though I&#039;ve been going through an unprecedented rough patch. I&#039;d say I&#039;ve lost around 45 of the last 60 odd games. Prior to this i was positive 30+ games on my normal&#039;s record. I&#039;m negative in ranked a few games but I&#039;m stuck in elo hell in bronze 2.\r\nAt the moment every 1-7 games I play either 1 person feeds lane, I get an AFk or I have a really bad game and play on tilt. In all honesty I&#039;m all for karma and letting the balance flow as needed but this is starting to really ruin my experience if not kill what ever confidence I had in my ability to play the game. I have tried taking breaks, playing different game types, playing in groups, different roles and nothing has worked. \r\n\r\nPlease don&#039;t be too quick to judge as I&#039;m not here to whine or complain. I&#039;m genuinely curious to what is wrong with my game and what I can do to improve it. Please any feel free to post any similar experiences or advice as this is an open conversation.","replies":[{"poster":"SpawnTheCaster","date":"2016-02-10T22:48:28.667+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Mate,\n\nSometimes I find that my mentality is the biggest factor with this kind of streak. The game hasnt changed much but you notice it more because you are focusing on it. I try to break it up with DuoQ with Rusty - another caster, or go to gym and just throw myself around the weights room.\n\nAlso it may be that you should start to focus on your play abit more. What could I have done to win that game, should I have grouped, could I have got us ahead or communicated an objective. When you focus purely on your own play I find I start to notice improvement and that makes me happier, then i can just go back to the grind.\n\nHope this helped you out, in short I think mentality is actually a big portion to how happy you can be playing league!\n\nCheers\nSpawn","replies":[{"poster":"Struggle","date":"2016-02-10T22:55:01.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You never should've shaved that glorious beard","replies":[{"poster":"SpawnTheCaster","date":"2016-02-10T23:01:56.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha it had to go!\n\nwas itchy and hot Sydney wayyyy too warm for a beard right now.\n\nSorry it effected you negatively CaptainHindsight </3\n\ncant you like me for me?","replies":[{"poster":"Struggle","date":"2016-02-10T23:07:18.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-02-11T04:42:39.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Spawn!\n\nI've been watching you guys religiously every single night since finals last year which i know isn't long but I didn't know this all existed until august last year.

Which led to me playing safer than usual since I didn't want to be the \"feeder\" to ruin the game for everyone. \n\nI had a similar mentality to you. I would go even or positive most my games but still lose and think, \"welp not my fault, I didn't feed\". But the real thing you should be thinking is, \"welp, that was my fault, I couldn't carry hard enough\". There are 3 kinds of players in Solo Que. Feeders, Neutrals and Carries.\n\nBeing a Neutral player is fine, as long as your team is lucky enough to get a carry type player on it you can do fine. But what you rely on is doing ok, average, and give the opportunity for others to carry you when you should be thinking about carrying yourself.\n\n------------------------------\n\nThe trick to getting out of Bronze is to main 1 role and 2-3 champions in that role. Get REALLY good at that particular role/champion. You will learn their strengths,m weaknesses and most importantly the **win conditions** of that champion.\n\nFor me, that champion was {{champion:75}} . He got me from Bronze 2 to Silver 3 in a couple weeks. Doesn't matter too much what champion you play, what matters is learning them inside and out and learning how to be a CARRY.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nI see you are an ADC main. my condolences. Nevertheless if you like playing bot lane, my tip is get a support duo. Doesn't have to be a friend, make a friend. If you play a game with a support who plays really well and you play well together, ask them to duo. Bot lane is so much easier when you have a consistent laning partner.\n\nHave you tried watching replays of your games? There are programs such as [LSI ](http://www.leaguelsi.com/)or websites like [Replay.gg ](http://www.replay.gg/)that record your games. Its surprising when you go back and think... what am I doing. why was I there or even, oh we could have gotten Dragon easily then etc etc...","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-02-11T05:09:14.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the message. \n\nOkay, so originally I started in the top lane. Main Garen with about 200k experience. Also Nasus is up there with 120k odd. Then after a while of struggling in lane against ADC's, Teemo and constant jg camping I got sick of it and decided I needed a change cause I wasn't having fun anymore. So i decided bot lane because i noticed in my games that i was losing, (back then) it was because the ADC wasn't doing well. So I decided I felt that my abilities and my knowledge/awareness was good enough to carry and make a difference so I picked ADC or Sup secondary. From that normally I do back myself to win 60-70% of games without sounding cocky or arrogant. Those are just the numbers I give myself realistically. Since all of this that's been happening lately it has thrown a massive spanner in the works and I know I'm probably not gonna reach top tier but if I had a good team or guidance I definitely think I could reach plat and be competitive. \n\nI would like to progress in ranked but ATM that's not my main issue. If I cant even be competitive in normal's games then I give myself no chance in ranked. So that's why I'm just working on just trying to find my feet again in normal's.\n\nI have tried Replay.gg but apparently u cant save it on the record perm and u have to start the record after 3 mins of the game starting? So i was like gahhh I cant be bothered and people will rage me for afk'ing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-02-11T04:45:40.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you all for your posts.

Just focus on your own gameplay in some normals. Try to improve one a **single ** aspect each game and focus on that until you are happy with your progress. \n\nAnother method i like to use is to go into a normal (**with friends recommended**) and play something completely different and have fun with the game. Don't stress about winning or losing; sure its definitely better to win but that's not really all the game is about. For me the most important thing first and foremost is to have fun. Generally winning follows that due to being in a good mood / not tilting etc. One of my personal favorite _FUN MODES_ is to pick a themed game with friends. So something along the lines of; Mustache only champions, Animal only or Yordle only teams; these can be pretty fun.\n\nHopefully you are able to get something useful from what i just wrote.","replies":[]}]}
