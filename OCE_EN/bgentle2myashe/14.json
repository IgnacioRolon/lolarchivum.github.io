The only thing I&#039;ve done that&#039;s been fun for the last couple of weeks was drills and working on my game with friends. I would like to ask the general community and boards followers if they would see value in having a group or place to go in game to discuss strategies, work on you&#039;re game 1v1, 2v2 and so on or even create a full 5v5 game like scrims. \nI am just really not seeing value or results coming from my efforts and I would like redirect my efforts into something positive and productive.\n\nObviously anyone would be welcome to join and share you&#039;re views or suggestions as long as you&#039;re not abusive or toxic and you genuinely want to climb and learn but not troll!\nAlso if any higher elo players would like to be apart of it to help the lower levels improve or even just play some relaxed games and have some fun that would be great too.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-07-28T08:00:09.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i too am interested in a mentor program since I'm horrible mechanically (and some days my decision making makes bronze look like challenger) and kinda new to league.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Last Breath","date":"2016-07-27T05:07:07.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey there, \n\nNot sure where you coming from, but if you want to do rank or planning to do 5v5 rank i'm happy to fill. if you can explain in more details on what your issue is, i'm more then happy to talk dont worry i don't bite unlike other players. in any worst case i've seen worst players but it just a matter of time when they need to life up their game and work their way up the ladder. I personally learn things the hard way because i always thought there is not hope climbing into diamonds. i'll give you tips on how to handle difficult players i mean just mute them or report them done, try to carry the game yourself if the others decides to feed etc... i've seen alot in my games, it's not good. anyway do reply to me if you want feel free to add me, we'll practice jamming games if you want to focus ;) \n\n-cheers xXThomasXx","replies":[]}]}
