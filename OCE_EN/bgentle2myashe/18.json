At this point you aren't even really playing the game the way its meant to be played. Nobody that I know uses this method (there are for sure people out there that do though) and yet are all still achieving S grades perfectly fine. Getting one of these grades isn't a constant thing. It's an achievement that means in that game you just played you were in the top x% of players playing that champion in that role. \n\n\n>Than you get those solo players who have to compare against that? Sure thing.\n\nWell if you are playing ranked then you have just as much chance as a challenger player playing ranked to get an S grade, even when playing solo. You are with and against players your own skill level and so are they. Even if playing solo in queues where you are going to be with and against players of differing skill levels (norms/TT) if you are playing to improve yourself and have fun, you are still going to get S grades on occasion. \n\n_**TL:DR** mastery level 6 & 7 are fun to get and because they are performance related, they shouldn't be easy. That being said, if you are getting salty and are losing sight of the main purpose of the game just so you can chase down your tokens, you seriously need to rethink your priorities. _","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-16T12:38:44.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to disagree 100% with the mastery level 6-7 though.

Head over to the team recruitment page and find some buddies that are keen to play normals. Play for fun though, not to grind and try and cheat the system for S grades. You'll get your chests. \n\nKeys aren't based on performance (in the typical graded sense), but they are given for wins. [That being said, the key drop rate is non-linear so it does taper off and it can seem like you aren't getting any](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/community/q/ask-riot-haz-keys-no-haz-bugs-please). It does reset every month though :)\nOnce again, find some friends and play some ARAM. A nice relaxing mode where the games are shorter and you can still get keys. \n\n>Even when I do I don't get the essence or the champ perm to upgrade.

Remember, its only for aesthetic purposes and no-one actually cares (other than you) if you are a level 5 or a level 7 champion. Everyone understands the struggle for essence.

I get why they are trying, but the fact is, anyone with a little effort and luck can get rank 7 on any champ.\n\nI have just been watching some youtube videos showcasing some REALLY BAD players, some of which have ranks 6 or 7, so yeh, I believe you when you say it means nothing, but again, why did Riot even bother?\n\nIt is yet another waste of time they are putting into the game rather than improve the overall game play for everyone.\n\nAlso on this:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Princess Yaia,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=A3M7RRE6,comment-id=00000002000000000000,timestamp=2016-07-16T23:03:27.415+0000)\n>\n> If you have spare IP, you can buy champ shards in the shop for 1700 IP. \n\nThe champ you get is random, you can't just buy what you want and get your rank up, spare IP will become no IP in no time.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-07-17T11:31:50.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Princess Yaia,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=A3M7RRE6,comment-id=000000020000,timestamp=2016-07-16T11:26:23.460+0000)\n>\n> Well if you are playing ranked then you have just as much chance as a challenger player playing ranked to get an S grade, even when playing solo.
