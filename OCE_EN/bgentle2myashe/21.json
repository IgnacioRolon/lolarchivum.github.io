I have been flamed repeatedly and seen others get flamed repeatedly in multiple games, sometimes only myself reported it and other times multiple reports were sent. Unless the system has changed and I wasn't aware I have heard nothing about any action that has been taken. \r\nThen today, the worst example of player behavior I have seen in a league game took place and I would like to know what do i have to do to make sure the people who were involved get disciplined accordingly. \r\nI just want to know that this system is actually being used and protecting us as it should because I am completely dissatisfied with it at the moment I refuse to believe that nothing can be done about it. \r\nI have saved the most recent game in full and I also have 1 witness who can vouch. \r\nPlease can someone give me suggestions or information to resolve my issue. \r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-05-09T09:18:30.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  I have found all toxic behavior I have reported to go unnoticed and I've had enough of it.\n\nCan you explain more about the situations you were in, that lead you to believe that it was a \"toxic\" act? \n\nIf ALL of the reports goes unnoticed, you might have thin skin and those toxic acts weren't severe enough to be punish. Can you provide more details?\n\n> **Then today, the worst example of player behavior I have seen in a league game took place** and I would like to know what do i have to do to make sure the people who were involved get disciplined accordingly.\n\nYou're leaving the context of what has occurred entirely up to the imagination here.\n\n> I have saved the most recent game in full and I also have 1 witness who can vouch.\n\nIf it's a player running it down mid then a replay will be clear. Text toxicity is another matter though; All you can do is report them and let the system algorithm detect it.","replies":[]}]}
