I feel like Riot is definitely on the right track to finding a good fresh client. Having said that, some things I feel like could use some work or might bring some flare:\r\n\r\n1. In different client pages the pictures and data has been reduced to save space and fit more in. I feel like it would be more effective to expand the size and add scroll bars or longer scroll bars because some of the data and animations are too small. \r\n2. I&#039;ve always wanted League client to have a log on and off option so I can leave the client open but log off and it also makes it much quicker to reset when I experience a bug. (maybe also if a hide availability option so I can be online and not be bothered). \r\n3. In addition to skins, runes and masteries, I think it would also be super cool and add more flare and customization if you could purchase back grounds or themes for your client.\r\n4. It would be a lot of extra work but if you could have an option where you could open a skins page like you&#039;re champion page. So you&#039;re owned skins are lit up and un-owned skins are black and white. \r\n5. Adding some variety with some fresh new spells. (for example: poison which works like ignite but burns through all shields, zonyas or abilities. 5th ability which works like all other abilities but it&#039;s a spell that&#039;s universal to any champion.)\r\n\r\nAll just ideas I think would make a really cool addition to the game but some might or might not even be possible. Either way keep the good work coming. Thanks guys!\r\n\r\nJonno.","replies":[]}
