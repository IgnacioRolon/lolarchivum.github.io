I read the Boards Universal Rules which does not include any information on necro posting or inactive posts. If someone could clarify this for me for the future please. \n\nYour Content Has Been Removed\nFrom: Riot Games\nHey bgentle2myashe,\n\nYour removed content:\n\nYou know the saying \"play with the best, become the best\". Pretty sure that's riots logic to match making people with different ranks. You can't improve unless you play people better than you. Also, there is \"duo\" with people higher rank than you which obviously gives you some advantage.\n\nThis is not a new problem with riot. The main reason so many people have smurf accounts is for the same reason. You have one account you learn the game on and is there-for impossible to climb with because of stats so you make a new one. Other than that don't know what else to say.\n\n\"Necro comments are removed as spam. Particularly when finding posts from searches, please be aware of the post date and activity of the discussion before commenting.\n\nIf a topic you wish to discuss is no longer active, we encourage you to make your own post in the appropriate sub-board.\n\nI'd like to emphasize that this is not a warning; however, please take some time to familiarize yourself with the Boards Universal Rules, as well as the guidelines for any sub-board you intend to post in before you do so.\n\nIf you have any questions about this moderation action, don't hesitate to reach out to the Boards Moderation Team via:\n\nThe Help &amp; Support (OCE) sub-board\nYou can contact the Boards Volunteers directly via this form or by sending an email to:\nocemods@boards.lol\n\nThese are volunteer-run services.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-09-23T11:43:50.913+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey mate!\n\nNecro-posting falls under the \"No Spamming\" rule. We don't have an explicit section referring to necro posting under that rule but the reason we make these removals is because it's generally understood that necro-posting isn't healthy in the long run for boards (or most forums). \n\nThere are quite a few reasons for this, but to be clear, accidental or occasional necro-posting is not something that we would ever punish for, hence the emphasis on \"not a warning\".\n\nFor example, some forums take the policy of \"one thread per topic wherever possible\", basically encouraging search and revival of threads, but our boards don't support long comment threads all that well or advanced searching, so such a policy would be more confusing than anything else.\n\nInactive posts also often contain outdated information. When you consider that this game updates fortnightly, an inactive gameplay thread that was relevant 2 months ago is unlikely to be now, (as opposed to the forums for a game that is set at release with maybe only bugfixes if any updates at all) and that too can create more confusion.\n\nThe revival of old threads also muddies up the front page of boards with content that has already been discussed and seen. We've observed that a fresh perspective and discussion (i.e a new thread) basically *always* gained more traction, had a healthier discussion and overall saw a better response than revived old threads did, even when the content was similar. This is especially true when the OP (original poster) is no longer invested in the post.\n\nThere is a decent amount of wiggle room with this rule, we use 14 days without activity to classify a post as inactive, but we won't *always* action comments on such threads. For example, if the OP revives the topic, or adds more relevant info (i.e, not just \"lol\") then we will generally leave that.\n\nIt basically comes down to the likelihood of there being any value added by reviving that post. If the OP wasn't seen on boards before their post and hasn't been seen since, and the comment is an answer to an empty thread, chances are that's not going to provide any value to anyone so we opt to lock it.\n\nWe are of course, always open to feedback on the rules (especially the more subjective ones), so any thoughts you have are welcome.","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-09-25T04:16:52.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey\nThank you for the informative response. \nI was mainly just wondering how long does it take until a post becomes \"closed\". \nAlso if those posts are no longer viable discussions based on forum policies why are the posts not automatically deleted or \"officially\" closed. I'm really not having a go or picking at the issue since it makes no difference to me but just wondering. I don't know how often noob necro posters like me bother you guys with this issue but it seems pointless to keep posts that can't be used.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-09-25T11:56:02.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">why are the posts not automatically deleted or \"officially\" closed\n\nThe short answer is because we don't have any way to automatically archive threads, either by locking them or deleting them, and it's far less time spent to delete the occasional comment and close a thread here and there than it is to manually lock all inactive threads.","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-09-26T03:37:56.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok no worries, thx.
