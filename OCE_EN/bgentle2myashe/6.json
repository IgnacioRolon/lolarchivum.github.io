In 1 game I sat and waited for 8 minutes and nothing happened. All I can do is close the client, reload it and log back in sometimes 5-10 minutes after the game has started because its hard to tell if it&#039;s me or someone else not loading.\nSo is this something to do with my computer, client or is it on Riots end? \n\nAlso I have been recording games so I can re-watch them and improve my game but in doing so I&#039;ve found a number of bugs and things that totally contradict what champions abilities are supposed to do. I&#039;m not sure though if there is a forum discussion area for that or someone I ask about it? \nThank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-06T01:02:17.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThat definitely sounds odd, have you tried [repairing your client](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#wq6)?\n\nAlso you said you've been recording your games, have you been using lolreplay/any other replay tool for this? I would recommend disabling/uninstalling those as they have been known to conflict with the game. A better replay system can be found at http://www.replay.gg/","replies":[]}]}
