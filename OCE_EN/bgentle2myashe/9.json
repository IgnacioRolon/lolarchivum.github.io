So I hovered over his name and it shows it loading his details but nothing loads. So I right click to view profile and it gives me an &quot;Unknown error message&quot;, but instead of giving me this persons profile, it gives me another random person profile on my list. Never had this issue before, it seems pretty random though.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-09-07T09:13:20.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nHave you experienced this issue since?
