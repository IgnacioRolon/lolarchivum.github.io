My idea of what league is or &quot;used&quot; to be compared with where it&#039;s going is vastly different. Playing this game as it currently stands makes me more toxic and salty than I&#039;ve ever been as a gamer let alone rioter. On that note I wish to apologize to anyone who may have experienced my toxicity and or saltiness. \r\nFor me it&#039;s no longer about having fun and spending time with friends playing on an even field with everyone having the same relevance. \r\nI wish league good luck and I hope to later return for an odd game but I&#039;m out. :-(","replies":[{"poster":"Vegathron","date":"2016-12-15T00:16:43.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi man yeah i feel you in some ways! this game can have me sitting there literally fighting the urge to not decimate my mouse! and boy am i having a bad season so far. 30% winrate silver 4 placement from getting gold last season finally! .. how do you think this game IS as opposed to how you want it to be? curious on your thoughts about its direction etc.\n\np.s. i still love the game just empathizing","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-12-15T01:21:50.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League is as its always been, a toxic fun trip of frustration and rage :)","replies":[]}]}]}
