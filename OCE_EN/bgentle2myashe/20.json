More specifically I have noticed a lot of bugs in 2016.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve seen peoples ults and abilities fly straight over enemies without any impact. I&#039;ve had about 1-10 aram games time me out regularly and when I try and reset and log back in the client tells me that my internet connection is offline? A few days ago my client started randomly lagging to the point it took me 30 seconds to type out a sentence. A few weeks ago every second game whether it be random ranked or aram was not showing up in recent history. Lots of people have been showing offline when their online and visa versa or it shows them online but their in game so I can&#039;t tell when their available. Now the worst of everything is match making has been REALLY frustratingly bad, out of 20 games the  last 9 (as an example) have ended before 25 minutes and have been completely one sided which in my opinion if the system worked it should be a rare event not regular (take professional play for example, it doesn&#039;t happen often a game is won within 25 minutes). That&#039;s pretty bad odds considering the games are basically decided before the game has begun.\r\n \r\nI still love this game, so much variety in champions, fun game play and generally a good community of people to chill out and just have fun but I hate to say with all these recent issues I&#039;m starting to lose interest and faith in the system working. Has anyone else experienced similar problems or know what I&#039;m talking about or is it just me?","replies":[]}
