So if i can do it alone in my dressing gown, you would assume that the multi-billion dollar company that fricken made the champion would realise it too.\n\nWhich means either:\n\n**1. Riot are compete imbeciles.**\n\nor\n\n**2. They know the champ will be broken but release them anyway for their own gain.**\n\nNeither option fills me with confidence.","replies":[]}]}
