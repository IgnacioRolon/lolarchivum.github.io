I&#039;ve had this issue 2-3 times over the last year and it goes away and comes back again. I just wanna know if there are only temporary fixes to this or if i can permanently fix it.\r\nAlso I read in another regions forum to solve this issue you go to &quot;run&quot;, &quot;services.msc&quot;, right click &quot;ip helper&quot; and turn it off. Followed by restarting the client. This had no effect for me. \r\nAny suggestions or help would be great thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-08-30T09:12:24.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nHave you gone through the [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) knowledgebase article yet?
