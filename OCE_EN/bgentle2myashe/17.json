At the moment I&#039;m 18 wins from 24 of my last ranked games. I&#039;ve climbed higher than I ever have before with an unprecedented winning record in ranked games for my own pb. I&#039;m really proud of that and I can finally start to enjoy some of the hard work I have put in to improve my game. Yet in normals I seriously cannot win a game to save my life unless I get carried by an extremely confident, aggressive meta heavy champion (in other words only in duo or trios with carry champions). We get monstered so easily in normals like we are playing against much higher elo&#039;s yet there rank says bronze/unranked. \r\nTrying to look at the scenario with as little bias as possible, the contrast in it self doesn&#039;t make any sense to me. I cannot wrap my head around what other factors could be causing these kinds of results. It&#039;s one thing when you experience losing or winning streaks which don&#039;t seem to end but it&#039;s a whole new thing to have both at the same time. \r\nI personally have found both ranked and normal queue/match making extremely problematic this season and some people have said it has been for the last 3 seasons. I really hope they have answer for this. I know the higher elos are experiencing issues as well but just generally speaking, the game is losing it&#039;s relaxed, fun nature with every patch.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-08-05T20:30:17.237+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">Yet in normals I seriously cannot win a game to save my life unless I get carried by an extremely confident, aggressive meta heavy champion\n\nI'm telling you this right now.\n\nNormals =/= Ranked for so many reasons ESPECIALLY when it's blind normals.\n\nFact is at this point in league, bans are basically necessary, because something is always OP as fuck.\n\nAnd not only this, if you Counter pick in ranked, you will find normals a lot harder because you lose this option.","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-08-06T07:35:19.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I some what see where you're trying to come from, but, last year even when I wasn't half the player I am now when I was even lower rank than I am now, I was 75%+ win loss in norms and couldn't win ranked because I hadn't improved my game enough. Now i improve my game to the best it's ever been and I get opposite results. \nAlso, I am firm believer in it's not who you play but how you play. Especially in norms the drafting on both sides is next to irrelevant. It's bronze and or  silver for that reason, because they are very lacking in game knowledge. You would think that ranked though, you get more experienced and mechanically minded players compared to normals. Not to mention, more likely people trolling, afking or trying new champs/builds. \nMy point is that my results completely contradict this point and I can't understand the logic of why.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-08-06T08:28:58.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing is with this your not taking several factors into account.\n\nA) Being bronze in ranked doesn't mean your actually Bronze in play.\n\nClimbing out of bronze doesn't just take skill, it takes persistence, and the want to actually better yourself, and people being in bronze, doesn't mean they play enough ranked to get an accurate representation of where they belong.\n\nHell I have had people tell me i should do ranked, as a gold 5 player, and i tell them that i really just don't have the mentality to put up with some of the people i get in my games.\n\nB)\n>You would think that ranked though, you get more experienced and mechanically minded players compared to normals.\n\nThis reasoning is flawed beyond belief, people play better when they aren't stressed about tryharding to win (or at least most do) and can just chill and play well, and your honestly probably going to find better minded people playing normals then ranked (because a lot of bronze players like to flame hard in ranked and not in normals)\n\nC)\n>Not to mention, more likely people trolling, afking or trying new champs/builds.\n\nWhile people try new builds in Normals, in bronze people do that all the time.\n\nNot to mention people also will afk for the downright stupidest things anyway, and trolling in bronze is basically a staple, so this logic is fairly flawed.\n\n>My point is that my results completely contradict this point and I can't understand the logic of why.\n\nThe Logic is there, your just looking at the wrong end of the stick, you can try hard all you want, and honestly i commend you for your win rate recently, but in bronze, you get a lot of people that play ranked as if they are normals, or worse, play ranked like they don't give a rat's ass because they are bronze, and will be willing to feed/afk at first blood.\n\nAs a side note, because your Bronze 1, your basically getting close to the second Bronze 5, being silver 5 doesn't mean anything useful, as you could just have not been demoted down yet (you only get demoted down from silver 5 upon having your MMR drag down to Bronze 5)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-06T00:02:50.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but also in normals you sometimes get paired with people based on your estimated rank and not your current one. After a win streak your estimated rank is probably higher. Also maybe it's teamwork issues, and there are some psychopaths in normals who have never played ranked but are probably around mid silver since they've got like 4000 games, playing only 1 champion. I'm probably bronze 5 but there are some scary strong people who are unranked.","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-08-06T07:43:33.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been noticing a lot lately that my team has 0 synergy and the opposite teams are peeling well for each other, baiting into bushes and even using a bit more complex strategies to read the situation and gain the upper hand. This is good to be dealing with in normals and practicing these things but I am still conflicted and confused by the results.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
