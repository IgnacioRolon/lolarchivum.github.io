I don't know if it's been since the recent update or not.\nEvery time I try and move a friend between groups my client pings as if I have received a message but I haven't. Then the person I am moving automatically gets moved to a group not of my selection. Then I can't move them at all. Does anyone know if Riot is aware of this issue or has anyone else experienced it? I doubt this is worth me reporting it but if there is a fix this would probably be the best place to find it right?\n\nI'm also seeing people that have finished their game but \"spectate\" is still available on there profile. \nSeems plenty of bugs to go around still on client\n\nThanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-12-02T08:53:30.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a workaround, some people have seen some success by un-grouping and then re-grouping offline friends.\n\nBeyond that, I believe it is a known issue, and running a client repair and/or a clean reinstall with the Hextech Repair Tool *may* help: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool\n\nSubmitting a ticket to player support is also a good move, because even if they don't have an immediate solution for you, it helps them track the issue and who is affected by it: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-12-04T03:04:22.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, no worries.
