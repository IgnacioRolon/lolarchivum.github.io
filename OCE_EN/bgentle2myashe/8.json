The last purchase I made was on the 11th I think and since then I&#039;ve played 30+ games and got back to 10k Ip. I clicked on the Loot and Crafting Inventory at the end of the day to check if I received any keys knowing I would have restart client, then when I logged back in I was down to roughly 3800. Should I send a ticket regarding this as a bug or is there nothing that can be done anyway?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-08-17T07:08:53.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nHave you already checked your purchase history in the in-game store? If not, i would recommend doing that first to ensure there aren't any purchases you've made that you've just forgotten.\n\nIf not, or there are purchases there that you DID NOT make, I would recommend [submitting a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) to Player Support. They'll be able to look into this further for you.","replies":[]}]}
