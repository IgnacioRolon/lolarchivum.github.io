I feel like i have some tips that could improve the game. Just want to say now, this game is brilliant. The amount of players that play on a regular basis is phonenomal. The fact that it is completely free to play is amazing. Im happy to spend money on skins considering it is free, so that is fine. The amount of champions is absolutely fine. I can see you guys at riot have been focusing on new items lately. And that is why i am writing to you. not sure if this will be taken on board. Not exactly sure how you guys take feedback from players, but my personal opinion is that you guys need to focus on more items rather than champions. The reason so many people play this game is because there is so much variety. Between all the champions and the builds. Nearly every game is different, although there are a few aspects lacking. Health and magic resist items need more work, besides spirit visage, and banshees veile, there are no mr or health items that really benefit eachother. Not sure if you guys are currently working on it already. Also adc items. Like, lets look at this simply. Infiity edge, blood thirster, blade of the ruined king, maw of maltirumus (or however it is spelt) and mecurials scimitar. are the only real ad items. yes it is backed by alot of attack speed items. But i feel as if there needs to be an item, that either gives the adc more survivability or more defensive stats or passive. I understand it is hard to base the game around proffesional play and leasuirely play. But we need more adc items, possible some more support items. Overall, the game is great, fantastic even. And i cant see myself not playing in the future, please just work on the items a little bit more. And i will be extremely satisfied with the game. More so than i am now. Hope you guys see this, and hope it helped. I just thought it was worth ten mintues of my time to try and get some feedback into the master minds of the game. Continue your work. I and millions of players are loving this game. Continue with your amazing work.

I'm expecting Mirage Blade to be introduced soon.\n\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Mirage_Blade","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-08-21T16:29:35.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Paragraphs are your friend","replies":[]}]}
