I think this would fit in with the possible reworks rito mentioned. about adjusting his Q to a skill shot?\r\nYou could have like a Passive buff that Read \"If you can dodge a wrench\" or something silly that counted the number of Q's you've landed on an enemy champion. I don't know what any of his other abilities could do. But i still think it would be hilarious all the same.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-03-10T07:02:25.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice idea","replies":[]},{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2015-02-06T05:39:11.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"simple fix dawaraven, change it to become another champion that uses balls, ori, or ahri, for example.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-02-04T07:54:16.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be a great skin, but pls no ryzer skins.
