His gaze darted quickly to the massive gold clad figure, reclined casually on the throne, yet exuding such menace that ezreal felt almost as if he were being smothered. He let his gaze move the bewitching woman standing beside the throne. Her gaze was unfocused while she stared across the room, no doubt waiting for the massive double doors to swing open, ushering in the maniacal &lsquo;wildcard.&rsquo; The only one missing was Twisted Fate. Twisted fate had been elusive the whole day, seeming to vanish every time Ezreal looked for him. He would have to ask the Queen about that later. \r\n\r\nThe drums suddenly sped up, now the rhythm of a galloping horse tattooing a beat into his brain. Everything was getting warm, the humidity and heat not helped by the blazing braziers that stood sentinel at intervals in the hall between the doors and the throne. A quick glance at the two on the dais showed they did not seem affected by the heat. \r\nThe drums began beating faster yet and with a groan the massive doors swung inwards slowly. A single figure stood silhouetted by the light. Small and wiry at first glance, but Ezreal knew from experience that he was one of the deadliest fighters imaginable. The figure let out a deranged cackle that scraped across the room like a thousand daggers and swaggered forward. Ezreal had to stop himself from flinching as the figure walked past and winked at him with those red eyes that hid madness and depravity. Instead he focused on a brazier burning lazily across the hall. If he showed any weakness he would have lost the game. And this was a game. All of it. It had been the moment the mad clown had walked in. He was a master of strategy no matter how half cooked he appeared. The first one to lose composure loses. Ezreal would be damned if he lost again. But it was becoming extremely difficult to stand still with an itch gnawing away at his nose. Shaco came to a stop before the large throne and its colossal occupant. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; Shaco grinned while reclining his head. If anyone else had shown so little respect, they would have found Morderkaiser&rsquo;s club with their face. But the fact that Shaco&rsquo;s head was still one with his body showed how wary even the King was off him. Though even if Morderkaiser had struck out, Ezreal had no doubt Shaco would have dodged.\r\n \r\nMorderkaiser merely regarded Shaco with a dispassionate gaze. Shaco instead turned to Syndra and knelt before her. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;My lady.&rdquo; He looked up at Morderkaiser and smirked. To show much disrespect&hellip; What was Shaco trying to achieve? Many would have attributed it to pure madness, but after having fought with and against Shaco many times, Ezreal knew just how cunning the psychopath was. \r\n\r\nEzreal almost jolted as The King of Clubs&rsquo; ominous aura seemed to coalesce and densify. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;It would be unwise to test the King,&rdquo; Syndra warned, finally looking down. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just joking!&rdquo; Shaco wailed between peals of laughter.  \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; Morderkaiser slammed the butt of his club to the floor. The thud reverberated throughout the hall. Ezreal pulled himself a bit straighter. &ldquo;What do you have to report?&rdquo; Ezreal had heard that primeval voice before, but the unadulterated fear it instilled in him never changed. \r\n\r\nShaco cackled once again, his black and white hair bobbing as his whole body shook. No one in the throne room would have been surprised if the clown fell to the floor in throes of laughter. Morderkaiser&rsquo;s patience was wearing thin, something Shaco seemed to realised, so with a final laugh, he straightened up.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Well&hellip; all those funny men in their armour are all dead now.&rdquo; Shaco pulled one of his daggers from his belt and started to pick at his black talons with it. &ldquo;I made them all disappear.&rdquo; Shaco suddenly looked over his shoulder and winked at Ezreal before turning back to the King. &ldquo;One more thing, My Lord.&rdquo; Shaco&rsquo;s grin widened.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;A simple magic trick!&rdquo; Shaco&rsquo;s howled as his hand whipped forward, a blur of black and red, and Morderkaiser roared in anger.The dagger had embedded itself in his collarbone, through a gap in his armour, oozing green liquid down his golden breastplate. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;You dare!&rdquo; Morderkaiser bellowed as he rose from the throne and swung his club at Shaco, only to pass through air as the mad clown disappeared in a puff of smoke. The club struck the floor with such force that it sent a shockwave rippling through the room. Syndra called her Dark Spheres to her as Shaco materialised behind the king.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Peekaboo,&rdquo; he taunted as he stabbed forward two new daggers. Ezreal had never really found out how the jester always seemed to have a dagger on him, or where he pulled them from.\r\n\r\nOne of the daggers glanced off Morderkaiser&rsquo;s armour, leaving a trail of viscous green liquid, but the other struck home, worming its way into a small %%%%% just below the King&rsquo;s underarm. Morderkaiser bellowed once again, this time in pain, and Ezreal snapped out of his reverie and scratched his nose before he willed himself to move. He used his gauntlet to shift behind Shaco, blocking off his escape route as the clown ducked under the sweep of a club, and leapt away from the dark sphere Syndra hurled at him. The clown had nowhere to go now. \r\n\r\nMorderkaiser lunged at the clown, swinging his club in a powerful overarm, calling darkness to it. But he was stopped short when something yellow whizzed through the air, embedding itself in the King&rsquo;s unarmoured wrist, freezing him in place as Shaco disappeared again. There was a moment of stillness as everyone took in the small square object, a yellow card playing card with an intricate design on it. Twisted Fate&rsquo;s. \r\n\r\nA sudden cackle echoed throughout the room as Shaco materialised at the bottom of the dais. There was movement in the shadows and Twisted Fate stepped out from behind a pillar to stand next to him. Ezreal sucked in a breath. He couldn&rsquo;t believe Twisted Fate, one of his closest friends, would just turn against them all. But it explained why Shaco was so aggressive. He knew he had one of the kingdoms greatest magicians on his side. \r\n\r\nIf Twisted Fate was part of this, then what else did the mad clown have planned? \r\n\r\nTwisted Fate made a gesture and the King unfroze. His hammer swung down and decimated the marble in front of the throne in a harsh crack. Surprised that he did not hit anything, he spun around and took in Twisted Fate standing next to Shaco.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;So you choose to betray me?&rdquo; Morderkaiser said evenly. &ldquo;One of my most powerful magicians, and my tactician? So be it.&rdquo; He raised his club into the air above his head. &ldquo;Come Children of the Grave!&rdquo; \r\n \r\nThe world went completely silent, as if holding his breath. Twisted Fate readied himself, flicking an array of cards into his hand. Shaco merely tilted his head and grinned manically.\r\n\r\nA sudden wail shattered the silence, then another, and another, and it kept building up till it had become a requiem of death. The room began to shake and the ground around the dais erupted, launching a plume of white dust into the air. Something acrid and pungent assaulted Ezreal&rsquo;s nose and as the dust slowly settled he got a full view of the vileness that now swarmed through the room. An army of spectral beings. So many different sizes. So many different shapes. All dead. They were all jostling each other, trying to seize the traitors, but something was keeping him back. \r\n\r\nEzreal realised what was going on and had to hold back a chuckle. For all their iniquity, and the sheer number of them, they were being held back by a few jack-in-the-boxes. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; Shaco drawled, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s time we made our exit.&rdquo; \r\n\r\nTwisted Fate nodded and sliced through the air with his cards. It pulled apart, revealing snatches of purple landscape. An unearthly whistling came through as Shaco stepped through, disappearing from the throne room. Twisted Fate cast a glance at Ezreal before following the clown through the rift. The spectres, not sensing their pray, faded away, leaving the room in silence.\r\n\r\nSyndra closed the door to her private quarters and rubbed her neck. It had been a stressful day. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Is everything in order?&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yes indeed, My Lady,&rdquo; Shaco swung down from the bed canopy where he had been perched. &ldquo;Just say the word and we can finally end that fool of a King.&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Patience, the time is fast approaching. It would be unwise to rush into things. Don&rsquo;t you agree?&rdquo; \r\n\r\nTwisted Fate grunted in agreement from the corner of the room. \r\n\r\nSyndra removed her coronet and let her hair down. Soon. Just a little more and everything would be hers.","replies":[]}
