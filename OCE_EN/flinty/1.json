I saw that the skin was 975RP but there was no '33% off' advertisement so I assumed that that was the normal price so I didn't rush out to get it. I just checked again then about to buy it only to find the price is now 1350RP. I'm disappointed more that there wasn't the usual % off image attached to the price as I would have grabbed it then and there had I known that price was limited. I guess now i'm just gonna have to play the waiting game for a 50% off sale 6+ months from now. :(","replies":[]}]}]}
