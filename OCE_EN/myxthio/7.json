WHOEVER SAYS SUCH A FEAT IS IMPOSSIBLE, READ IT AND WEEP!\n\nAnywho, the video belongs to Chook Chook, a good friend of mine: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy7V...\n\nAnd the idea to use clips and references to Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure, I have to say the idea was originally from Munchyjr so go watch his vids as he inspired me in my editing: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSLTvMEi7uoHPl349o_GVXg\n\nAnd I do not own anything in this video. I don&#039;t own Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure, or League of Legends as they both belong to their own respectful owners","replies":[{"poster":"SammyTheDeadRat","date":"2016-03-17T05:29:47.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) got completely destoryed {{champion:17}}","replies":[{"poster":"Myxthio","date":"2016-03-17T07:18:51.116+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hehe, thank you!
