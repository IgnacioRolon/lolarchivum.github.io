Bee Keeper Malzahar","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"So recently I&#039;ve been trying out {{champion:90}} and might I say..... He is SO MUCH FUN. And I took a look at his skins..... though they disappointed me (Apart from the Djinn and Snowdown skins) and I wondered what other concepts could work well for the prophet of the void. Eventually I grew bored and went to the internet, where I found an old meme and instantly thought of this. The whole &#039;NOT THE BEES!!!!&#039; thing got the gears turning in my brain and I had to say this.\r\n\r\nMalzahar NEEDS.... or would look good with, a Bee Keeper skin. \r\n\r\nHere&#039;s what I&#039;m thinking:\r\nPassive Voidling - Ok, this was difficult to think of, but I say either a fat bee, or some sort of bee/voidling hybrid. Or a bee pattern voidling if that&#039;s too much. But it&#039;d be nice having a pet that could float around with Mal.\r\nQ - Two bee hives appear and a swarm of bees make a wall that fly past and then back to where the hives were, or they just disperse.\r\nW - A big puddle of honey appears on the ground that can then sink back into the ground afterwards. Pretty simple,\r\nE - Literally, Bees. Big swarm of bees around the victim&#039;s head. \r\nR - Either a stream of honey being shot at the victim, or just a line of bees being shot at the enemy and holding them down. \r\n\r\nVoice clips:\r\nMoving/Walking/Floating - &quot;This is going to sting....&quot;\r\nTaunts - &quot;Death as sweet as honey....&quot; &quot;Yes! Yes the Bees!&quot; &lt;---- (Reference to the &#039;NOT THE BEES&#039; quote) &quot;Float like a butterfly.... sting WITH the bees...&quot;\r\n\r\nAlso his clothes and the way his mouth is always covered just suits the Beekeeper look. Slap on a Bee Keeper&#039;s uniform on him and call it a done deal because this is brilliant! I think..... My friends think so.","replies":[{"poster":"Meow QAQ","date":"2015-09-05T10:05:11.390+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds great !","replies":[]},{"poster":"Plasmarine","date":"2015-09-04T19:50:33.880+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This needs to be done!","replies":[{"poster":"Myxthio","date":"2015-09-05T00:39:57.857+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes!
