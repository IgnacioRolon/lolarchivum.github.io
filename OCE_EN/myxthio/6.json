While the Let&#039;s Plays are more traditional and less edity and more play-y. I&#039;d like to hear your thoughts on my vids and if I could improve with certain champs.\r\n\r\nI also play with another youtuber who goes by the name of ChookChook and he&#039;s a really cool guy, check him out and subscribe if you like!: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy7VvmpZt1HCa5kPh9kCqvQ","replies":[{"poster":"Not a Hooker","date":"2016-10-20T07:54:27.185+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This channel actually looks pretty good.\nLike better than some of the stuff I've seen with 1k subbs.\nFirstly, I'll definitely subscribe.\nSecondly, I have some experience in making youtube channels big, want me to help?\nThirdly, along the same lines, if you want better quality thumbnails made I'd be happy to help.\nFOURTHLY and finally, add me in game: Frozen Despair.\nThat was all, sick channel dude!","replies":[{"poster":"Myxthio","date":"2016-10-20T08:28:30.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hehe, thanks man! I'm trying my best to be as comedic and entertaining as I can with the editing and gameplay. I've been trying to get a good AD Taric Top lane game since I've been able to make it work several times. Buuuuut the recordings go haywire in the end, so I need to try again. Either that or AD Leona, either work amazingly well somehow.\n\nAnd maybe a few bits of advice/help would be nice, but I don't want a crutch for getting up there. I wanna learn how to get up through feedback and what not, but like I said the advice/help is much appreciated if it's nothing massive.\nThumbnail art that's better? I'd really like to see what you can do, so perhaps send me an example?\nAnd of course I'd like to play with you! You seem nice. Make sure to share a few vids with your friends if you like them {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Not a Hooker","date":"2016-10-20T09:13:05.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\nGood thing too that you don't want a crutch for getting there. What I meant sorry, was with spreading the word and stuff.\nHaha, AD taric, i've been rocking AD Thresh top personally, it's hilarious.\nAnyways, we'll talk more in League.\nAbout the thumbnails I'll get to it in a couple of weeks, this time of the year is a bit busy for students, haha. I'll get it to you ASAP.\nIn terms of feedback I'd say for 16 subscribers, your video's are EXTREMELY polished but yeah when you grow (I'm sure you will) look at channels like foxdrop for an example of some super polished examples.\nAnd defs gonna show my friends don't you worry about that~","replies":[{"poster":"Myxthio","date":"2016-10-20T15:16:40.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well that's very much appreciated, thank you!\nYeah, did AD Thresh top today and managed to leave a jax 0/7/4 by 30 minutes. But then their team started to snowball and we lost. Regardless, two shotting EZ and Zed was fun.\nI know we said we'd talk more in league but I needed to try and get some doombots footage and it was a 5 man, sozz.\nAs for the timing stuff and students, I understand. Though school ends soon enough for me since I'm skipping on exams this year with my course, so I'll be free for a long time once november rolls around.\nAnd thank you. I try my hardest to make quality videos like M3RKMUS1C and Sp4zie and stuff do, since they really are an inspiration with their simple yet hilarious edits.\n\nAnd I'm sorry, but whenever I see your name all I can think about is a Monokuma being trapped in an ice block. Seriously I'm getting Danganronpa flashbacks. Especially the NicoB ones.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Myxthio","date":"2016-11-21T15:27:22.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"* Bumping because why not? *","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Mark Show","date":"2016-10-26T03:53:15.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your friends are funny, but you play the victim \"of blah blah\" to much in your commentary which evokes a negative response towards your from the viewer, also if you want more exposure get an EU and NA account to lvl 6 playing bots because of the ping then you can post on there forums, I've gotten 381 subs in the last 8 months partly because of that its [http://www.youtube.com/SentienceLOL] if you want to see what I'm about.
