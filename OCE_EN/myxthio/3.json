Full of memes and bad jokes as i get camped mid by a hecarim!\r\n\r\nI only have iMovie to edit my videos, but please tell me what you think! Am i doing good for my low budget editing? Is there anything I can improve on?

EVERY time Hecarim ganked you, you were holding onto TWO wards. Even placing down one of them could have saved your life.\n\nOther than that, it was pretty funny. The editing was pretty good considering you're using iMovie.\n\nThe OPM meme at the beginning didn't have to be there for *sooooooooo* long. A second or two would have been enough. Also, your audio... invest in a better sounding mic... please. Even a $15 one from MightyApe would be better.","replies":[{"poster":"Myxthio","date":"2017-05-29T09:27:29.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah... my logitech headset is kinda weird now.
