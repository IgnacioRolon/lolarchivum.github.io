ADC has Miss Fortune, Support has Sona, Jungle has Heracrim, Mid has Veigar, and Top has Riven. \r\n\r\nBut I&#039;m thinking...... we need a bigger player select. We got Battle Boss Blitzcrank, which means there are now two support arcade skins. Hence also meaning that the roles can be filled in again with more retro arcade skins. I&#039;m thinking something like a Reboot. A sequel. We&#039;ve gotten two sup skins, now we need two for the rest of the roles. I know it&#039;s hard work for Riot to do these things, and I respect that. I&#039;m just putting this here as a suggestion or idea, it&#039;s not necessary, nor am I demanding it. \r\n\r\nAnywho, let&#039;s look at what we got so far.\r\n\r\n**Top:** Riven\r\n**Jungle:** Heracrim\r\n**Mid:** Veigar\r\n**ADC:** Miss Fortune\r\n**Supp:** Sona, Blitzcrank\r\n\r\nBut then take a look at the splash art for Arcade Riven and Battle Boss Blitzcrank found here: http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Riven/SkinsTrivia?file=Riven%20ArcadeSkin.jpg\r\nIt&#039;s safe to say that we&#039;ll have 1 more &#039;ARCADE&#039; skin which&#039;ll be a Mid Laner, and 3 more &#039;BOSS&#039; skins for ADC, Top. and Jungle.\r\nLet&#039;s start with the lesser number of the 1 ARCADE skin.\r\n\r\nWhat champs? I&#039;d say for mid my choices for arcade skins would be: {{champion:99}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:115}} or {{champion:103}} \r\nBut that&#039;s just who I&#039;d like to see get a Retro Re-work.\r\n\r\n**Lux?** Well we already got Star Gaurdian, so anything is possible. Maybe since she&#039;s a bit of a white mage, make her dance simmilar to that of the Final Fantasy victory dance. Give her some colourful clothing like the others, pixilate her abilities, ect.\r\n\r\n**Ziggs?** Seriously, it&#039;s like playing bomberman, so give him some cartoony bombs that are all pixilated and have a retro explosion sound. If they can do a skin that resembles Sly Cooper for {{champion:29}} then why not give Ziggs a skin that resembles our robot bombing friend? And yes, Bomberman is a robot.\r\n\r\n**Heimerdinger?** I got nothing that I can put into words because the image is a bit hazy in my head, but it&#039;d be cool. His death animation can reference the Donkey Kong &#039;Mario/Jumpman&#039; death maybe. Or just have Heim tinker around with an Arcade Cabinet for his re-call animation.\r\n\r\n**Ahri?** I&#039;ll be honest. I just like using ahri and I think adding some pixilated effects to her Orb (Big ball of pixels), make her Charm pixilated and same goes for her Fox Fire would be great. It all works out good to go all blocky with her abilities. Her costume? I&#039;m having a hard time deciding. But maybe the dress she usually wears can be made into something a bit &#039;mage&#039; like. Or just have it be bright and colourful like the other girls&#039;\r\n\r\n**ONTO THE BOSSES!**\r\n\r\nADC wise, I think maybe Draven could make the cut. Make his coins that rain down be all pixel-y, have the coin sound be retro, have his axes have a certain flare to them that screams &#039;retro&#039;. Because I can&#039;t think of any specifics I don&#039;t know about his costume, but who wouldn&#039;t love this {{champion:119}} face on a retro style of things? He&#039;d be having so much fun! And we would to!\r\nEither that or maybe give the Arcade skin to Jinx. Now imagine how that would look!\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve ran out of creativity at this point, sorry to say, so I&#039;ll list the other champs for the Boss thing.\r\n\r\nTop? Rengar, Singed or Aatrox.\r\nJungle? Nocturne, Shyvana, or Shaco\r\n\r\nSo that&#039;s my thoughts on if the Arcade skin line continues. What do you guys think? Leave some comments so then we can discuss and stuff ^_^\r\nIf you think it&#039;s not a good idea or you want to complain, Final Boss {{champion:45}} might 01001011 01101001 01101100 01101100 you.
