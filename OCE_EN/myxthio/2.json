(New Idea added to the list)","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, let me get listing things.\n\n- Pimp Veigar: He has the cane, he has the swagger, he has the power, so why not slap on a fur coat and give him some bling and then we got ourselves a pimped out mage! Maybe change his abilities to a gold colour when casted, give him some pimp-ish quotes, and I&#039;d love it! Also make his cane and claw gold, maybe add one of those pimp hats or whatever. #VeigarSwagger\n\n- Racecar Veigar: To honour the stupid and yet somehow working build of Racecar Veigar/Movement Speed Veigar, I say we slap him into a racing suit, put a driving helmet on his head, and change his cane to the Clutch Stick of a manual car, and it&#039;d just be amazing! Maybe have one of the sponsor logos on the suit or helmet be something like &#039;Team Yordel&#039;. And put on some evil font for the suit, or an evil number. Either way.\n\n- Kami Ahri: Let's get Ahri even more Japanese inspired by making her like one of the Gods seen in the game ÅŒkami, but changed of course and still mainly human looking rather than a full animal. But the ears and tails can stay. Her hair and fur can be changed to a white colour with some orange markings here and there, her tails can have black tips, and shall we put her into a kimono of sort? The more traditional ones? I dunno.\n\n- Arctic Fox Ahri: Change her tails and ball to a more icy blue, add some snow particles and effects for her abilities, slap on some fluffy headphones, as for what kind of clothing, I'm not sure considering Midnight Ahri. But just something warm looking (To wear), cool colours, and still having some Ahri charm to it * Ba-dum-TCH! * I'm thinking light and icy blue.\n\n- Pool Party Ahri: Ok, this skin has been teased by Riot several times in splash arts, log-in screens, ect. And since Ahri is one of my mains, I'd really like this. She could just wear a swimsuit, probably red in colour, but the main cool thing she'd do is that her orb and her Q would be a Beachball instead of an essence orb. And that'd be kinda funny. Please Rito put it in next Pool Party!\n\n- Pudding Zac: Just as the name implies, and it's not that hard to do, so make Zac a giant Pudding man. Kinda like this but less cute and more Zac: [Here it be](http://th01.deviantart.net/fs70/150/f/2013/155/7/2/cute_pudding_by_balurus-d67t6fb.png)\n\n- Priest/Pope Veigar: Behold! The all holy Pope Veigar! Let him cleanse your sins (And take your souls) with his divine light! So basically, dress him up like a Pope, his wand/cane is a cross or a wooden cane/wand, dress him up like a Pope of sorts, and light up his abilities to white and gold rather than black and purple. And please don&#039;t make a reference to the Dress thing that was on the internet before  (# TheDress)\n\n- Orca Nami: Let's get her more used to the chilly waters by changing her from a normal Marai, to a Orca or Whale kind. Maybe put on some eskimo clothes on her, and it'll be pretty cool. At least I think so, I just want one of my favourite supports to get some more skins. Maybe add some blubber jokes to poke fun at her :p\n\nTell me what you guys think :)\n\nALL PRAISE THE RACECAR VEIGAR BUILD!!! It's actually so much fun XD {{champion:45}}","replies":[{"poster":"CoffeyFlavoured","date":"2015-08-27T23:37:20.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Arctic Fox Ahri skin idea I could get behind, maybe as a chroma pack for foxfire? that way you could throw in A wind Ahri and a Lightning Ahri as well?\n\n{{champion:103}} skins never go wrong... Although not to sure on the new one myself","replies":[{"poster":"Myxthio","date":"2015-08-31T01:48:24.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get where you're coming at. Kinda like an elemental chroma pack for her? I can kinda see that happening as a thing, though I just wanted a potential Ahri skin for Snowdown tbh. Arctic Foxes are one of my fav animals after all =3 But an {{champion:103}} chroma pack would be cool to see also. Rito plz listen to us ; w ;\n\nAs for the Academy one..... it's either hit or miss with people. Some like it, some don't. I'm fine with it, honestly.","replies":[]}]}]}
