Gaining 19 lp is the standard amount (average) but losing more than you gain is bad. Gaining more than 20lp is good, 25 + is even better and anything below i suppose 18-17 is alright/bad\n\nEdit: Ok youre probably wondering why certain amounts mean awesome-good-bad (sorry i couldnt add it in because i had to go shower)\nEverything depends on your mmr. For example i did all my placements and landed on s5. If i play 1-2 games and i gain lets say 27 lp, that is saying that i dont belong in the current elo that i am and should be higher than the elo (mmr is higher than the current elo). If i gain 19-23 lp that says that i belong or my skills are in the current elo. Anything below 17 i suppose is basically danger and most likely going to drop if u lose the next few games (technically gaining 15 lp or less is that stage)","replies":[{"poster":"Swany","date":"2017-01-11T15:16:46.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, that makes sense, thanks for straightening that out for me.","replies":[{"poster":"He Meant Mine","date":"2017-01-11T15:20:05.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Swany,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=NEPAuXVE,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-01-11T15:16:46.733+0000)\n>\n> Ah, that makes sense, thanks for straightening that out for me.\n\nNp :3 gl with your rank games though","replies":[]}]}]}]}
