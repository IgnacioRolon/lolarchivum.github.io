If I didn&#039;t own every champion league has to offer.. Alas my earnt IP gets the better of me, just too many hours played I guess, but surely it wouldn&#039;t be unfair for the chests to only unlock skins if the player already has every champion.

As it stands, it seems like these is a slightly more chance of getting a skin than a champion. \n\nEven if you already own all the champions, you can just hoard the shards to re-roll them upon the release of new champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Swany","date":"2016-05-11T23:38:43.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What would the point be of re-rolling for the new champ, when the time comes that a new champ has been released I've got so much IP saved I can buy the champ straight away, regardless? :P","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-05-12T00:00:47.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Save the IP for trolling your friends by changing your name every week :P\n\nSoon enough your champ shards will be useful as you can use them for the higher up champion mastery levels.","replies":[{"poster":"Swany","date":"2016-05-12T05:30:00.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That comment humours me, considering in the past month I've been known as SoCloseToStoned, ConcreteJunkie and now, not 5 minutes before reading this, I've yet again changed to JohnCenaConfirmd.\n\nI guess I will save the shards instead of wasting them re-rolling. xD","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tweak","date":"2016-05-05T03:01:15.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a 50% chance to get a skin, same as with a champion.\n\nI believe the chest first says \"Skin or Champion?\"\n\nThen it metaphorically chooses from the box of skins/champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-05-05T03:19:01.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Technically, it's all completely random.
