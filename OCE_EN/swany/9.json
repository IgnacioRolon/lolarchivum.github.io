Excessive negative behavior can result in a Two-Week or Permanent suspension at any time without having a chat restriction on the account.\n\nThis and a whole bunch of other stuff about how the system works can be found in the newly updated [INSTANT FEEDBACK SYSTEM FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-).\n___\nThe second thing it will be important for you to know is this:\n\n> **BUT WHAT IF I REFORM? IS IT POSSIBLE TO GO DOWN THE ESCALATION PATH?**\nYes! Players who show consistent reform or show positive behavior in their games will help heal their accounts reputation.\n\n[It takes 3 months of good behaviour to drop a punishment tier](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/f/mNBeEEkI/d/p7scKW1K?comment=00050000000000000000). What this means is that if your last punishment was a 25 game chat restriction, and you demonstrate good/neutral behaviour for 3 months your next punishment will be a 25 game chat restriction again. Another 3 months and you'd be down to a 10 game chat restriction.\n\n___\nAs for your question specifically, there is no way to check what your account standing is, but if you've been chat restricted recently it's safe to assume it isn't 'clean'. However, if you continue to demonstrate good behaviour you needn't worry about receiving a permanent ban. \n\nThe reform card in your email will give you the date of when your last punishment was, which ought to give you a good idea where you sit.\n\nI'd like to offer you some advice, but also some congrats. You've recognised that your behaviour is unacceptable, and tried to distance it from those it could hurt, that is a really solid start, you also have recognised your situation BEFORE you hit perma ban, something which we unfortunately don't see a lot of here on boards. So kudos to you for that.\n___\nNow for the advice. The first thing I notice is this:\n\n> keeping my hatred for the low lives on my blessed server away from the rift\n\nNow I don't really know who you're defining as 'low lives', but I'll try to give you a bit of perspective. \n\nTactical disagreements and just being plain bad at the game are not punishable behaviours, everyone has to start somewhere, and you're idea of the 'right' tactic will often not align with someone else's. Try to see things from their perspective if you find it's tilting you, and if you can't do that, or if they're being overly stubborn, just play around it. \n\n_If they're determined to go for baron and you know that it's the wrong call, but they're going to do it anyway, rather than thinking about how much of an idiot they are, try to think instead of how you can use it to your advantage. Maybe you can split push bot lane while everyone is distracted at Baron, or maybe you can set up and ambush around it. Maybe all you can do is sweep the pit so the enemy doesn't have vision, but it still drastically reduces the risk._\n\nThe other category you might be considering here is negative players. Those that demonstrate toxic or troll behaviours or are just generally out to ruin your game for one reason or another. This of course IS reportable behaviour. Please be aware that the system will only see games that have been reported, so if you don't report in post game, nothing will happen to them.\n\n_Retaliation is NOT an acceptable response to these kind of players, and will only serve to get you punished as well. Defending yourself is fine, but responding with negativity in kind is not. It only creates cycles of negativity._\n\n**In either case, try considering what you have to gain by engaging with them. If someone is refusing to listen, or badmouthing you, what can you really say that is going to change that? The answer more often than not is _nothing_. \n**\n**Engaging with negativity in any way just adds fuel to the fire, so ignoring them completely is your best bet, whether you choose to actually mute them or not. And if someone is set on a decision, you aren't going to change their mind, just waste time typing when you could be playing the game.**\n___\nThere are a few things I'd recommend if you find yourself tilting or steering towards negativity.\n\n1. **Mute everyone:** If you can't engage positively, then don't engage at all, simply mute everyone and play the game to the best of your ability.\n2. **Move your chat off screen/unbind your chat key:** Muting doesn't stop you from typing, just from reading, so if you find you are still tempted, remove chat from the equation entirely. Negativity hurts your gameplay and experience as well.\n3. **Take a step back and a deep breath:** Sometimes all you need is a bit of space to remember that ultimately you are faced with some stranger on the internet who you will likely never see again. Their opinion should matter as little to you as yours does to them. Just because someone is being a bit of a potato or being angry and negative themselves doesn't mean you have to as well.\n4. **Turn off summoner names: **Maybe this one seems a little strange, or like it wouldn't do anything, but if you're the kind of person that tends to fixate on someone's bad plays or negativity then it can actually help a lot. You'll see here on boards people that say they have lists or keep checking back on negative players they've encountered in the past to see if they are still playing, and all that does is keep around this lingering negativity you feel over something relatively insignificant. You can't ofc turn off summoner names in post game or match history, but you can just avoid them entirely. If you've had a bad game, is it really worth looking at the stats? Just click skip waiting for stats and avoid your match history until you've let it go.\n5. **Take a break: **Try to stay out of the \"Just one more game\" mentality. If you've had a bad game, chances are your next is going to be a a bit sour, maybe your next few. Instead take a break, do something else for a little while until you're out of the funk. I see people say things like \"why should I have to take a break because of someone else?\" but how about instead \"Why would I play another game if I know I'm going to be salty?\". Don't force bad experiences on yourself, League isn't going anywhere.\n\n___\nThat ended up a lot longer than I thought it would...\n\n_**tl;dr Read the first two bits for the official info, and then try to find out why you're negative and find ways to avoid it, it'll make your experience, and the experiences of everyone you play with that much better.**_","replies":[{"poster":"Swany","date":"2016-05-12T07:40:00.340+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I appreciate the time spent to post this comment. \n\nIn regards to the \"low lives\" I am referring to the people who set out to cause trouble, such as my new friend below (Corki did 911) who think causing problems is funny.\n\nMy problem is i'm not a naturally toxic person, I just have alot of anger issues that summoners so to trigger often, which in term ends with me getting reported for flaming hard.

They are as you say, setting out to make trouble, you getting dragged into it is hardly going to make them stop that. League can be a uniquely frustrating game at times, which is why it's so important to take a break for that perspective.\n\nIt seems to me that you genuinely believe you can reform your behaviour, and seem to be willing to take steps to do so, instead of sitting around waiting for the community to suddenly change what they find offensive and then bitch when you get a perma ban. You've taken the warnings to heart and that's what they're all about. The whole point of the tier system is to encourage reform in those who would be willing.\n\nSo respect to you for trying, it takes a big person to accept fault in yourself.
