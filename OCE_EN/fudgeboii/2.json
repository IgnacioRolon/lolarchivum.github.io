Turret is a briefcase that opens up to reveal a turret, when it disables it shuts into a briefcase.\r\n2. Missiles are regular missiles, maybe black and white\r\n3. His grenade is a flashbang\r\n4. Ult is the same thing.\r\nHeimerdinger should be dressed in a tuxedo or black and white suit, his goggles replaced with cool black shades.\r\nJust an idea guys I have no plans on paper, just sitting in my head and decided to share.\r\nPlease make this a thing :)","replies":[{"poster":"Fudgeboii","date":"2015-03-13T12:57:17.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]}]}
