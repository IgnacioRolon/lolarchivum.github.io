Like,  as Shaco, you have enough trouble clearing camps, you have to recall very often. Udyr gets free sustain, free stuns, free shields, free attack speed, free aoe, free movement speed. And I'm expected to keep up with 1 crit, slows, an almost useless fear due to the new smite (when counterganking), a clone that doesnt clone the buffs, shows you different stats, and a 3 second stealth jump, like that shit doesn't even reset on kills. Your clear time is possibly the worst in the game, a ranged minion can practically one hit you (exaggerated but you get it), your miss chance procs once in a year, it doesnt work on champions, you cant 1v1 ANYONE, you have to plan what the enemy is going to do for the next 20 seconds before you try to kill them in their jungle. you dont start with enough attack speed to proc the golem stuns, you're not tanky enough to work well with gromp buff. your E does jack damage until it's maxed, your boxes die with one auto attack from a non tank and generally you want to attack the squishier damage-based targets. Any targetted CC destroys you. Your Q can only juke so much. You're melee. Your boxes do no damage if you're building AD unless you waste your whole mana bar and stack them. No one falls for box stack baits. They only last 1 minute. You sometimes have to ulti to just clear camps. Sword of the Divine was removed. Riot either nerf every other jungler or buff Shaco. Also, BMing should be a much more serious offense than afk. I shouldn't have to wait 5 minutes before every game for 5 games. That queue they're going to get for BMing is the same as if they did nothing wrong, when I chose that they didn't deserve to win, and I wasn't going to join a group of idiots for the sake of winning, sorry but no, Riot, and people are doing this even in high elos. They might be more tolerant, there may be less BM, but people have the right to make it harder for their team to win because of people showing childish behavior. If no support, jungler or top laner deserves respect, then why else do you think League is known to have the worst online community? Answer me that, Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-02-05T02:43:20.787+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shaco actually has one of the fastest early clears if you know how (box), and Udyr only gets it all free with a blue buff, not to mention you're not meant to go toe to toe against him because it's just how it is.\n\nIf Shaco can clone buffs he is just OP, unless you like your fav broken.\n\nAgain, Shaco's damage is insanely high if you know how and can get it rolling.

I know how to box stack. Everyone does.  Everyone is clearly misunderstanding my whole post. If I re-read and then read your comments, you're 110% correct.\n\nYou just weren't at the receiving end. If they said something as stupid me being horrible or whatever, like I get it, I'm not ganking (by the way I was, just that people were asking for ganks when I was clearing my buffs and I said \"coming after blue/red\", when I get there, they've already died to Udyr and blame me because I decided to come gank when I am stronger).\n\nI walk by chickens and the chat just fills up with people complaining, not just 1 lane, ALL lanes. I try to gank bot, bot is warded, graves and thresh back off and I'm told that if I came earlier, they wouldn't have had time to react, when bot has already given 3 kills to Graves and he's back with a BF.\n\nThey literally said \"you lost our lane\", when Udyr didn't even go to bot lane once. I used to have a 75% win rate with Shaco (over 20 games) in S3 and then I had a horrible run and dropped to like 45%, because all of us have made the mistake of continuing to play ranked after losing a promo.\n\nAs much as I'd love to mute everyone, if your entire team is storming you for their mistakes, they don't deserve to win. I'm sorry, but I'd rather drop to Bronze 5 than see them in Silver, because I've played with Golds who got carried and I felt like I was playing with level 12s. \n\nI don't want to be a toxic player. I don't want to ruin games for other people. If I make a mistake, I'm the first one to say what a god I am (sarcasm). If I'm playing Thresh and I miss a hook and we STILL win the team fight I STILL apologize. If your jungler tells you he'll be there after clearing his buff and you play aggressive when you know you aren't going to have back up, that's your fault. Don't go blaming ANYONE. If I'm getting destroyed at bot lane, even if the enemy jungler is camping us, I don't BLAME my jungler for not ganking, I ask for assistance and tell them why, what brushes are warded and possibly even a gank strat.\n\nI hope these paragraphs make you feel more comfortable to actually read into the actual situation. This post isn't even about Shaco, it's about the fact that toxicity is still not being punished, when winning a game shouldn't be the most important thing, it's a game, you shouldn't ruin other people's fun. If you're blaming team mates for your mistakes, and your team mates can't take you, no one is having fun, hell, even your opponents are probably sick and tired of easy kills from people typing. I might sound like a total liar, but when people d/c in a fight and I kill them, I DO feel sorry for them. People always say \"aww when I make a mistake I'm bad but when you make a mistake you're lagging\". No, I'm sorry, if all my abilities are available to me and I just walked into a team fight to die (without using anything), I clearly d/ced. They clearly d/ced. You clearly d/ced.\n\nAs bad as League connection is (yes, the servers, I see league lag on super computers too, especially during peak time), yes, you can blame practically anything on lag.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-02-05T03:00:47.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Last thing, paragraphs.\n\nSuper good advice","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-02-05T02:34:54.330+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
