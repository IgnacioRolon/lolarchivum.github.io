I played Trundle support as my main support Thresh was picked before I got to him as I was last pick.\n\nDuring my game my AD carry was hooked by the enemy Thresh many times as she did not understand the importance of standing behind minions. This makes playing support a huge problem that a single player really can&#039;t control, as building locket and talisman only gave her more confidence to stay and fight rather than using it defensively and running out. Our Lee Sin also had a lot of problems with face-checking brushes while the whole enemy team was missing, getting him constantly caught out and asking where they came from.\n\nSo what am I proposing? Just a bant? Not really, there is a way to fix this, 1 could be unhealthy for the game in the hands of toxic players, the second makes new players work a lot harder and thus gain a lot more experience with the game so they&#039;re ready to play league of legends with knowledge of really basic mechanics. The third allows players to have knowledge available, with content that is already free.\n\nIdea 1: The boosted animal police:\n\nI know Riot removed reporting people for being a bad player. I know they&#039;re more than fed up with getting toxic players flinging reports every game even at players who don&#039;t deserve it, then they have to go through it and aren&#039;t really able to give out a punishment for people being worse players anyway, it is kind of a way to report yourself for being salty. I&#039;m not talking about a bait self-report feature. I&#039;m talking about an MMR drop of 20 for each report in the same game where the player has heavily under-performed. The game&#039;s new replay system could save and post a query for the Tribunal to judge on based only on what happens during the game, rather than what&#039;s said in the chat as receiving salt is by no means a reason to act like a child and intentionally feed. It&#039;s up to the tribunal to see if the reportee is correct to drop this player&#039;s MMR by 20, multiple reports in 1 game will be compressed to 1 post highlighting the player who was reported and what their team tried to do to maintain the game afloat, giving also the number of reports so that the unskilled player drops the correct amount of MMR.\n\nIdea 2: Copper rank:\n\nNow I&#039;ve been to a Riot panel before where this was a very big topic, Riot just didn&#039;t know how to implement a separation from Copper and Bronze. So this is my way to I guess. Most players will tell you they wish people played at least 200 normal games before playing ranked. While I think that&#039;s a bit too much and it might tip the entry level scales to be &quot;too much of a chore&quot; to start playing, it definitely makes ranked play healthier. So my proposition is the Copper rank, where players have to play a total of 100 (not 200) games of PVP on summoners rift (normal or ranked) to advance to Bronze. Players in Copper can still gain MMR and jump divisions if their MMR is THAT high when they finish their 100 games, this also puts a big blockage towards smurfs going in and ruining bronze and silver simply because they have challenger/diamond mechanics and want a side account to play with their friends/mystery gift themselves etc. What will this do to ranked? It will give players enough knowledge about basic mechanics through experience to play a game at least safely if they aren&#039;t confident in their match-up or champion.\n\nIdea 3: League Academy:\n\nI&#039;m sure a lot of YouTube content creators for League of Legends would be happy to share their informational videos for new players as being part of the League of Legends client, sort of like a League of Legends 101 encyclopedia so people don&#039;t feel like they have to venture out and find someone they heard is genuinely good at the game only through word of mouth. The amount of knowledge YouTubers and streamers could provide could probably fill the world&#039;s largest library as there are close to infinite little tricks and techniques that everyone plays around with and makes the champion unique to themselves such as the gate technique from Trick2g or the Quasus build or even Korean tank Akali and Miss Fortune support (yes I know it&#039;s very situational and not very strong in most matchups). So what would that allow players to do? First of all have more information on the client that just very basic explanations of their abilities and a little clip of the ability, giving vital knowledge to players from all over the ranked ladder, Have you reached Challenger without playing old school out-of-meta champions? Do you want to see what a Challenger level out-of-meta champion main can do with that champion? It&#039;s available somewhere on the internet. People have posted endless amounts of guides on every champion ranging from bronze to challenger skill levels.\n\n\nand PS\n\nPlease bring sandbox mode in already Riot, we&#039;re waiting.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-11-16T03:03:42.667+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"league academy, but make it mandatory to watch every video in its entirety, and mandatory to pass a test in normals where you have to acomplish one of the things you just learned about, only you have to do that test for a minimum number of skills.\n\nInstant cancer removal of ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Hot Pope","date":"2016-11-16T03:56:16.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say for some yes definitely but I'm talking about guides for every skill level, so I'm talking about even creep aggro, fancy combos, odd but useful tips like using shaco ult to jump over a wall on your right, item strategies etc.\n\nSo basic lessons should definitely be mandatory, but there will also be really advanced lessons for people who want an edge.","replies":[]}]}]}
