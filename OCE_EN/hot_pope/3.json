If they said what Grouchy claims then obviously they deserve to face the consequences of such.\n\nIf the system didn't catch it, then either something went wrong, in which case a manual review can apply the consequences and also pass on the fault to be addressed, or there is some context we are missing that disqualifies them from those particular consequences, whatever form that may take.\n\nUltimately, I cannot speak from other people's experience, only my own. In my personal experience, such language has *always* been punished. Of the cases I've seen brought up elsewhere, the only one I recall ever being confirmed as missed was also addressed. There have also been some such claims and similar proven completely false.\n\nUnderstandably, I am reluctant to change an entire opinion contradictory to my own experience, what I've seen confirmed and what the company as a whole has stated, off of a few players in a tiny boards community. \n\nIt's certainly not impossible that I'm completely wrong and the players like you are completely right, but I just don't have anything remotely concrete to support that contradiction. Hence the recommendation to follow through with manual reviews, because if there *is* something wrong that's the first step in getting it addressed.\n\nI like to think I'm decent at keeping an open mind most of the time, but just as you have the right to defend your opinions, I have the right to defend mine.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2019-07-22T06:18:31.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's no concrete proof, none at all, just ignore the hundreds of thousands of videos uploaded daily that tends to prove otherwise.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ornn","date":"2019-07-17T23:04:06.545+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"you dont get chat restrictions for telling people to kill themslves its a guaranteed 14day ban riot says that all the time but again i dont see a 14day break in their match history","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-07-18T05:18:37.056+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"See all the above points.
