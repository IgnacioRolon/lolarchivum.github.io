This would allow jungle elise to be played as full ap, jungle amumu full ap, jungle heimerdinger, jungle malzahar, swain. Just think about how nice a triple nade stun gank would be with heimer. It would give mages some durability by getting aggro off of them from a jungle creep and have them clear for you so mages (which lack a bit of clear time unless they destroy their mana bar) will clear faster while gaining mana back, it could also be used against minion unit based champions in terms of counterplay, especially recently, when smite top became a thing.\n\nI would call it Persuasive Smite (item: Tome of Persuasion), which would be best used to start a camp rather than finishing it, giving it a slight weakness during dragon/baron buff securing. For the icon, I would put a ritual book with a green aura/glow, best played with the Magus enchantment.\n\nOpinions and feedback would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"PepijndM","date":"2015-05-31T17:06:48.474+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree jungle Karma or jungle Diana need buffs, but I don't really think this is the right way to do it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Torea2","date":"2015-07-22T23:31:35.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"jungle xerath is actually quite good","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-31T04:48:59.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly Magus is fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Hot Pope","date":"2015-05-31T05:01:25.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah but that's a smite enhancement, not the actual smite item/buff.

I don't know what you're trying to point out. For B, chill out mate, that language gets you in trouble in these forums, so have chips with no salt cos we got enough in OCE.\n\nNiche junglers are fun. Why would you want to constrict the jungle to only let junglers in? \n\nblue smite is better for assassins/chasers like rengar, yi, irelia, rammus\ngray smite is literally only good for shaco (if your enemy jungler is awful), nunu and lee sin.\nred smite is for on-hit gankers like rengar, warwick, jax, skarner.\npurple smite is for faster clears on camps, usually used on champs that have long ult cooldowns so they don't have good gank potential much like amumu, sejuani, nautilus, rammus (and even maokai uses this as he is super mana hungry, when you don't have blue you literally have to otherwise recall) etc. these guys will usually stay in the jungle until a really sweet ganking opportunity opens up while they have their ulti up. sejuani may be a slight exception due to her Q knockup and deadly slows already being strong while her ult range and duration is overkill.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-01T03:10:50.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">red smite is for on-hit gankers like rengar, warwick, jax, skarner.\n\nI'm seriously not even responding anymore because you are one of the really slow people that thinks this even though i went over it in my own post.\n\nKeep whatever ego you think going, because it won't let you listen to actual players with actual intelligence that are telling you why your wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Hot Pope","date":"2015-06-08T11:55:22.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an AP, you don't want to deal sustained damage (unless you're swain or fiddle in which case you might auto but even fiddle has other sustained damage apart from his ult that is channeled, so you can't auto during that, if you were maybe running a teemo jungle/ekko jungle maybe juuuuust maybe). your auto attacks are just to add a bit more damage when your combo is down.\n\nI don't know why you're butt hurt.

This is just an idea, and there's no need for you to bash it. You can just say \"I don't like it because of such and such reasons\". Don't try to come into a creativity thread and turn it into a lesson, I'm not asking for it from you, and I wouldn't ask of a lesson from a player with anger issues. I'm not here to teach you anything, and you shouldn't be. I'm here to display my idea. Don't like it? Tough.
