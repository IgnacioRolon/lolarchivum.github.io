Champions must be bought in order of; Cheapest > Expensive AND A>Z IE: Amumu, Annie, Ashe, Garen, Kayle etc.\r\n2. ARAM will be played till 30 (from 6 as i am doing this sober) once i reach 30 ranked will begin (new rules will be implemented if/when this happens).\r\n3. Drinking games work as follows (for ARAM) (swig= half a mouthful, Chug= Full mouthful);\r\nEvery bot Friend or Foe: 1 Sip\r\nAsk in all chat \"who's not a bot\": 1 Swig for each response\r\nAnyone talking not in english: 1 Swig Per response (one per person)\r\nEvery kill: 1 Sip\r\nEvery Assist: 1 Sip\r\nEvery Death: 1 Swig\r\nTriple Kill: 1 Swig\r\nQuadra Kill: 1 Chug (doesn't stack)\r\nPenta Kill: Finish drink, you ain't drunk enough\r\nEvery tower dropped Friend or Foe: 1 Swig\r\nEvery Inhib dropped: 1 Chug\r\nEvery health rune used (by me): 1 Swig\r\nAny AFK's: 1 Swig\r\n\r\n1 more level and i will likely be doing a game tonight with these rules.\r\n\r\n(Also apparently i can't post this in misc, and the boards seem to think i'm level 1?)","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-03-06T12:47:17.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So if you were defending well but you kept losing inhibs..\n\nYou might even die from Alcohol Poisoning","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-06T13:09:30.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You ever tried an ARAM at level 6?\n\nI'd die because of bots as the game starts.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-06T12:59:41.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds interesting, mind if I join you should you happen to do a game tonight?
