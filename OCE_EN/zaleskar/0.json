If anything they do the opposite because new players are exposed to a less than ideal environment for learning the game and getting invested.\n\n*Every* free to play game has bots. A lot of not free to play games have bots. Runescape (both OS and 3) have bots, WoW has bots, ESO has bots, literally any free to play asian MMO has bots. How quickly they are banned varies, how easy it is to create a new account for botting varies, but the bots remain regardless.\n\nIf there is a market, bots exist.
