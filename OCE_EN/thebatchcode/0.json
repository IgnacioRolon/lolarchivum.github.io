With a hidden surprise.\r\n\r\nNow before I begin I can only give ideas, I'm not great with the numbers, so if this ever gets picked up, I leave the rest of the work to them.\r\n\r\nPassive:  Converts a percentage of Atma's maximum HP into Attack Power.\r\n\r\nQ: Sword Stance, this takes two forms, One sword, and Two Sword stances, both these forms change Atma's E ability\r\n\r\nOne Sword (Impaler): Slightly increased AD and increased chance to perform a crit strike.\r\n\r\nTwo Sword (Fury): Increases max Attack speed.\r\n\r\nW: Bring Low: An on target ability which damages and saps the targets movement speed equal to a percentage of Atma's max HP\r\n\r\nE: Two abilities, which switch in accordance to the amount of swords Atma has equipped.\r\n\r\nOne Sword (Glimmering Strike): Atma charges in a line through enemies with one slash of his sword, dealing increased damage the further he travels. \r\n(For instances, if he hits a target right next to him, only a bit of damage is dealt, while if he hits a target right at the end, it deal considerably more)\r\n\r\nTwo Swords (Piercing Strike): Atma throws one of his sword in a skill shot, piercing enemies till it reaches its end dealing damage and on-hit effects, as well as reducing any hit targets armour. After Atma has thrown it, he switches back to One Sword Stance, until either the cooldown on the E resets and he can switch, or he retrieves his blade, which instantly switches him back to Two Swords Stance and greatly reduces his E's cooldown.\r\n\r\nR: Ascend: Atma loses his Q ability and gains both buffs from each stance, and takes flight, now controlling the blades with his mind from his temporary ascension he can attack with each sword from a distance.\r\n\r\nE While Ascended: Atma's Impaler: Atma, while Ascended charges in a line, spinning his blades around him dealing damages in a larger radius until he reaches his end. This inflicts Damage and applying on-hit effects, while reducing any hit enemies armour.\r\n\r\nWell, there you have it folks, Atma's Return. He sounds strong, so maybe tweeks can be made to him....but I feel like the League could use someone of his talents.","replies":[{"poster":"ToxicHawk","date":"2014-12-16T22:20:31.913+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like what you have come up with so far.\nKeep at it.\n\nAny plans on coming up with some designs?\n\nGG!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-16T10:07:53.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That explains why you can't buy Atma's Impaler.\n...\nBut Atma's Impaler is a spear, not a sword!\nHowever, if you are gonna say he has two stances and his impaler is a sword you could just as easily change it to a spear.","replies":[{"poster":"TheBatchCode","date":"2014-12-16T10:56:26.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could indeed, it's early days so we can work around it, hell he could have a double sided pole spear of sorts, and it could detach into two?","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-16T13:10:48.867+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that is an interesting idea I'd like to see art of!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2014-12-16T10:12:01.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe have the character's main weapon that he holds all the time, a broadsword, while the spear is safely tucked on his back like a shield.\nIt would look awkward with Second stance though, lol.","replies":[{"poster":"TheBatchCode","date":"2014-12-16T10:49:58.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, he could hold a sword and a Spear, and use his E for that.\n\nEarly days thinking around flavour and so on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheBatchCode","date":"2014-12-16T10:49:40.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, he could hold a sword and a Spear, and use his E for that.\n\nEarly days thinking around flavour and so on.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MrButter","date":"2014-12-17T19:31:06.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very nice i must say, i agree its not perfect but the concept is GOLD! i think change his weapon to a quater staff, like a bo staff with a curved blade similar to a scimitar on each end. the quater staff would be able to split in two. i cant think of anything off the top of my head to put in place of W which keeps in line with the Health theme.....maybe something similar to Karma's \"Focused Resolve\" that slows while tethered and damages for a percentage of Atma's max HP\n\n\n..... and i REALLY hope i don't seem too opportunistic :P but i was wondering if u had time that could take a look at a Champion Concept i came up with?

His E throw sounds like Olaf a little and also would the effects last on his q stack? (like use the twin blades for attack speed then switch straight to one sword for more aa dmg and crit strike with out his Ult on?). Also the Ult with E sounds ridiculous with the dmg that you could deal (since it reduces armor and applies on-hit procs) and I'm guessing you mean on his passive he gain BONUS AD dmg based on his Maximum HP, but would this mean if you built HP on him would his passive bonus would increase?","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-16T21:18:09.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This seems awesome.","replies":[]}]}
