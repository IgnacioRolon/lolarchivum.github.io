I have a good dozen or so games, people are nice, you get your harassment but they tend to get over it....then there's these people...I'd call kids, because no adult would even speak like that, it's not even funny.\r\n\r\nSo, what's wrong with asking an adc to be careful? Theyve been caught out a bit, but its okay earlier days, I'll just forward my concern. Boom, he explodes for the rest of the game, swearing this and that, f's and c's.....the point is to try to win correct? You dont get anywhere when everyone is fighting. The support got offended so they fought back....and the mid abused everyone beside themselves.....it was everything elo-hell was made to be.\r\n\r\nBut I just dont understand it, whats gotten the younger age group....hell a majority of the community to become so toxic, you're in ranked to win correct? This just worries me the amount of trolls everyone will face come new season....kinda just turns you off the game completely..you want to have fun, and we can all admit sometimes even if you lose, you still had fun, but even if you win sometimes, if you're getting cussed and abused...the game just loses it's juice. I know nothing can be done, it just makes me very sad.\r\n\r\n*sips tea*","replies":[{"poster":"mythosmc","date":"2015-01-17T21:30:21.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll feel a lot better once the ladder resets in a few days","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-01-17T11:01:13.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These people are kids and adults alike, simply refer them as bad people would do, no need to insult a generation just because they were born more recently.\n\nRaging issues kinda becomes more apparent when a game requires team to actually achieve victory, against other players, LoL is one of those. It sucks, I admit, and when this game was younger there used to be less raging, at least very minimal in normal games unlike today where the only places people don't actually rage are custom and bot games.\n\nPlay this game on and off, I do that. When I feel like I can't handle the heat, I just give it a break and come back when I feel like it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-01-17T00:37:45.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What those kids have is the attitude of a low elo player and that's why they'll never leave low elo unless they buy an account or receive a boost.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CoTheSlow","date":"2015-01-16T15:03:05.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah sometimes the community just sucks.

It's a bit of pressure to not let your team down. So everyone is on edge and maybe he thought you were being sarcastic or maybe he is just toxic. It sucks but it is just a part of the game, sadly.","replies":[]}]}
