(lets say after 10 or so seconds can another AA-ignite be inflicted)\n\nIgnition damage: A set amount plus a small percentage of your base Ability Power.\n\nQ: Ignis shoots a fireball from his corrupted hand in a skillshot, dealing a set amount of Magic damage and igniting the struck foe. Alternatively you can cast it on yourself to ignite your blade.\n\nW: Ignis slashes in a cone dealing AD damage, if your blade is ignited the length is increased, dealing extra AP damage as well as setting ablaze foes whom are too chilly.\n\nE: Ignis dodges in a line, leaving behind a small trail of fire, which burns out....pun......after a few seconds, slowing and igniting any enemy who walks through it.\n\nR: (Wildfire) Ignis warps to an enemy, then releasing a huge explosion of fire in a radius of the targeted champion dealing tons of burnies (AP damage) in the radius and igniting them all. IF!!! Both Ignis&#039;s blade and the opponent are both on fire, the target is stunned for 1.5 seconds (this may be taking it too far)\n\nLore, this will also explain what he looks like...I&#039;m not a great writer, but I&#039;ll try.\n\n\"Next we all knew, Kegan exploded into flames after touching that cursed flame, killed half of us....we don&#039;t know what became of him, a demon?\"\nIgnis a crewmate of the Marauder Kegan Rodhe was one of the few who survived his former employers choices, seeing the flaming phantom burn a path into the distance, those who survived went their own ways, but Ignis left burnt by the blasts and unconscious awoke an unknown time later, with a glow in his right arm, yet burnt and unable to use it, he wanted answers for what he witnessed, and followed the clues, the baron burnt scars and the dead. On his journey Ignis felt rage grow in his, and heard a voice, a burning vengeance \"Overcome the flames, destroy the Brand\"\nHis arm grew into an abomination, a twisted burning pain, left him outcast to the common folk, reaching a land called Valoran he found the answer he seeked, the arrest of a flaming spirit, cursed to fight for The League.\nOn his journey to find this league he encountered a budding scientist called Viktor, seeking the same prize, amazed by Viktors lack of disgust for the deformity Ignis bare, but saw it as a fault to be perfected, and forged him a hextech blade, powered by the immense energy that the corruption produced, the blade helped Ignis to channel his power that he was bestowed on and thus aided him to focus the destruction, whereas...Kegan could not.\n\nThe two ventured forth, each to their own goal, Ignis, satisfaction for the rage caused by the corruption that was spread to him, and perhaps answers on how to extinguish the flames within him.\n\n_\"The flame can spread, to bad Kegan, you created the Wildfire that will smother you\"_\n\nFrom that I will try and make a depiction of Ignis, but you can all make your own interpretations, but I am eager to give an update soon, and as always your views are valued and appreciated.\n\n*sips tea*","replies":[{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2015-05-18T13:14:27.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like this concept.

The idea is mainly spread...aha....by the passive idea. To create flames, spread them around and burn everything. The spells merely utilise this, he's a fighter, go in and deal damage and ult to secure, a slow on the Q may round him to a more useful image to release the ult dependency. But he's kind of a champ that will thrive off minions, hence why he needs to spread his flame to secure as much gold as possible and become scary later on even if down a kill or two.\n\nCombo ideas, if a kill is possible Q, to set target ablaze, E in melee for sword fire, W for the added damage then ult for max damage. I'm intending on him to be an AP Bruiser, so if he can tank some damage and deal AOE damage in a fight, melting down enemies and focusing down one target, leaving enough toasty prey for the rest of the team.\n\nHe is not intended for mid, he is a AP melee Bruiser, which can also be played AP/AD if you're feeling spicy.","replies":[]}]}]}
