After many denials of getting proof to unlock my account they still won&#039;t let me get access back to my account. Their system of authenticating people owner account is broken, who here even remember what their first 6400 ip champ is? I honestly would think some people do remember, but i really don&#039;t. I gave them my full bank detail with past 3 transactions of rp i bought, which i BOUGHT with proof of transaction straight from my bank account. Gave them my full email, bank number, everything, they answer back by telling me that i&#039;m frustrated, i&#039;m pissed off not because of account locked (well maybe) but because of them not helping. They do not even bother to look at the matching detail of who the owner is, and why don&#039;t they chat with account that is link to an account? I&#039;m using this as it is link to the account that is locked, because of suspicious activity, well thank you, but how do you want us to get it back? Go home and remember your first champion you bought or skin, and come back and... and we might consider it ( i imagine this is what they would say). {{summoner:4}} \r\n\r\nAll i want to say is, fellow league players, you are not alone, is just that we can&#039;t do much and i&#039;m trying to communicate to League that they should imply a new system of authentication or security system like Steam, so that the player won&#039;t have to go through a lot of trouble when they lose their account.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time,\r\nLife de Pablo","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-12-01T00:51:12.784+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They need more than one or two points of verification for account ownership. *Just* your bank statements or *just* your something else isn't enough. \n\nWould you prefer they give your account which you've spent time, effort, and possibly money on to some random stranger because they got access to enough of your basic info, or would they prefer you be thorough?\n\nAt any rate, the questions they give are a guide only. Any and all information that is *unique to your account*, but not *visible on your account* is helpful. For example, the first skin you bought **IS** helpful, but a list of skins you own **IS NOT**.\n\nOther information you could offer would be things like \"I bought x skin the day it released\", \"I refunded x champ/skin\", \"I bought x of my rune pages with IP and x with BE\" and so on. Any specific purchases can be helpful so long as they aren't in your purchase history and are from before the compromise occurred, though of course the earlier the better.","replies":[{"poster":"Life de Pablo","date":"2018-12-01T02:02:49.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the message, so i could actually tell them what particular skin i bought on that particular date and time, could actually help me in recovering my account?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-12-02T03:39:47.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any specifics you can remember about purchases not visible in your purchase history (or that were visible while the account was compromised) can help.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Life de Pablo","date":"2018-11-30T13:36:43.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Further from this, if i'm alone in this case. Well gg to me then, i just want to put it out there so i can try and talk some sense into them to develop a new authentication way so that i can log back in to my account as i spent a lot of money in this account.","replies":[]}]}
