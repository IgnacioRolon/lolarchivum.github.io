Which is unfortunately often the case. A good support can get the adc through most of the laning phase safely (by playing safe) and then can roam mid or setup for a jungle gank to win lane but it doesn't work if the adc is toxic and won't cooperate. Abandoning a bad but not uncooperative adc is generally not a good option because then they'll get frustrated and possibly start feeding and no matter how bad they are, if they have even the slightest csing skills they will eventually scale into lategame enough that they'll be useful.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-13T07:22:52.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With this gif I think you'll notice how the farmer is just using brute force and is not managing his tractor properly and won't achieve anything.\n\n Support is much the same you can't just brute force it (unless your adc is also really good in which case you generally have enough horsepower to just rip that tree out of the ground), you need to adjust for playstyles, work together, consider what approach to the laning phase is best considering matchups, maybe you just want to break even during laning phase in which case you play defensively with poke or maybe you want to play aggressive and go all out in which case you play aggressive and position together as such, looking for picks.\n\n Always be positive and calm and if it's not working take a breath and change your approach. You need to decide carefully when to roam, how you position in lane, attempt to get vision control and keep track of the enemy jungler. You should look for opportunities to call the jungler in for ganks and then prepare for the incoming gank to make it as effective as possible. Communication is also key, try to keep moral up and offer advice or ping when you think the enemy team might be making a gank and you should always try to have a plan and work to play around whatever the opposing team is doing. Some games can be decided before any big teamfights  just by outrotating the enemy team and forcing objectives.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-13T07:25:34.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All this said I'm bronze so what do I know.
