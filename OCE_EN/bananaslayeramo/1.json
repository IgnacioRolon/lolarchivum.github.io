So far, I&#039;ve had a few games where almost everyone worked together and had fun. Trying to decide on a single person to honor felt a bit counter-intuitive. \r\n\r\nI know that this may lower the value of each honor, but players who are consistently good teammates will still be rewarded. It feels rare for only one player to stand out in such a team-based game, so it would be great if everyone could get the glory.\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-06-15T07:41:06.045+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is as you say to make honours more meaningful. Only being able to honour one person makes it so much more valuable, so if they do make it possible, they have to keep that value somehow. I think a possible way to do this would be to give everyone a free extra honour...let's say every week (and maybe stacks up to two sorta like hextech chests do). This way, using those extra honours still has meaning, since they aren't common, but if you have a really good game, you still have the means to spread the love.","replies":[]}]}
