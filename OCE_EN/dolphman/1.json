Like I understand someone has to lose but if it is in overtime the point lose should be minimal. \r\nMaybe kick overtime earlier instead of waiting for the timer to end so if you lose in normal time you still lose more points that if you lose in overtime.\r\n\r\nIt just sucks the way it is now....","replies":[]}
