Seriously. I was disconnected just ONCE tonight due to an internet problem, and reconnected before the match ended. In return I&#039;ve been placed in a low priority queue for 20 minutes? Who the hell is honestly going to sit around for exactly 20 minutes just do they can get into a game in the first place. 5 minute queue&#039;s, I understand. Heck, I&#039;d rather a ban in all honesty. I don&#039;t really give two craps if I don&#039;t play for the next month. But instead you may as well of perma banned my account because I ain&#039;t never going to sit around for such a bullshit amount of time, just so I can spend another 10 minutes dealing with kids dodging, to finally get into a match after half an hour, just to have more kids feed and troll, all over ONE disconnection that I&#039;m sure your data could prove was latency related and not my fault.","replies":[{"poster":"GentlemanReptile","date":"2015-10-23T00:44:24.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"100% agreed.\n\nThey recently had maintenance that affected a bunch of ISP's in certain regions and didn't realize that it would cause a whole boatload of disconnects and server errors that prevented people from playing. \n\nI copped low priority que for this but wasnt too worried because I sent them a ticket about it and thought \"Surely they wouldn't force a punishment on people when it wasn't their fault? Surely they would rescind any bans or demotions or anything negative that happened to their players as a result of their own incompetance.\"\n\nHow fucking wrong I was. I got my support ticket back today and they \"cant\" rescind the low priority punishment.\n\nBunch of clowns.","replies":[]}]}
