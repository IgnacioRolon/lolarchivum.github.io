Both can play against each other countering each other abilities. With Illaoi's E theres none of that, she doesn't have to wait for anything and she isn't disadvantaged if it misses.\n\nsay gnar for example, even though its a massively spammable ability, He cant just shoot out his boomerang willy-nilly, he needs to think about catching it again, because if he doesn't, not only does he lose his only CC and this is left more vulnerable, he loses a large portion of his sustained damage, so a lane opponent will wait for him to shoot it out and then go in on him, making him jump to safety and then he loses his boomerang for a significant amount of time. So even if he is vsing someone who he counter picked he cant just randomly toss his boomerang or use his leap every time its off cooldown, because that gives his opponent a chance for counterplay. Illaoi needs this on her E.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-12-02T02:43:17.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She really doesn't need any mechanical changes at all.
