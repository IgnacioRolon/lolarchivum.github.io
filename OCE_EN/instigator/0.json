I have benefited from this new system and think it has made the game more enjoyable by minimizing arduous experiences whilst discouraging unsportsmanlike behaviour. However I experienced a very frustrating issue with this system earlier today, which lead to seemingly arbitrary punishment.. While the client was loading a game on summoners rift, I bumped my computer causing a crash. I managed to rejoin shortly after the second minion wave spawned (given thanks to my SSD for the fast reboot). The moment I reconnected, the game ended due to a majority vote of 2 (my premade didn&#039;t even get a chance to submit his vote) subjecting my account  to the rather harsh penalty of five low priority waits, a sum of 100min&#039;s. \n\nI understand this is poor timing and error due to my left foot smacking the tower, but I would rather see guilty men walk free than an innocent man in prison. _Please_ consider increasing the time window to avoid this happening to fellow innocent summoners or incorporate safeguards into systems capable of policing player behaviour. \n\nI do think it&#039;s unjust to impose such a terrible penalty without the option to repeal, given the circumstances. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read this, \nAn innocent man in prison.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-09-17T10:31:48.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The LeaverBuster system allows for rare disconnects like the one you experienced. It only begins to punish players when these disconnects become a little too frequent.\n\nI can tell from your penalty that this has happened with some frequency before. This is why you received a punishment for going AFK.\n\n I know it's really unfortunate that you got punished for an accident, but to be blunt you wouldn't have been punished if you didn't AFK all those other times.\n\n__* \nTo be fair though, I'd like the system be more forgiving for games that end in remake as well. \n\nI'm sure **Riot** has _considered_ stuff like this, it's just very hard to prove that you accidentally bumped you PC, and didn't do it to dodge an unfavorable match-up. Not to mention It's also very costly. I'd imagine subjective issues like this would have to be hand reviewed by staff.","replies":[]}]}
