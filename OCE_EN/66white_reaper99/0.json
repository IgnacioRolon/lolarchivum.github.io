Have you done the more basic stuff, such as closing all other programs and making sure no one else is using your internet connection?\n\nHave you also tried uninstalling your firewall/anti-virus? Be sure there's a way to reinstall them afterward, as browsing the net without them is dangerous. This is only to test.","replies":[]}]}
