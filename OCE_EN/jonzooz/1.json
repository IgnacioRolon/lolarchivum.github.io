Please check your network connection and attempt to reconnect to your game. &quot; You get 2 options from here to retry or cancel, retrying doesn&#039;t absolutely nothing and cancelling brings me back to the home screen and I cant make another game but i cant start another game. I disabled my firewall, it worked once then it didnt work the next game, what really frustating is that, if you rejoin and play the game and win, Riot punishes you for it, why is that fair, they  understood my problem and why did i get punished. I honestly dont know how to fix this problem if anyone knows please tell me.","replies":[{"poster":"4y5tvb8","date":"2018-05-04T11:08:09.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Had the exact same issue. Had 3 games lost from leaves, 4 others i came late and forced my team into a bad start.\n\nRiot have said they aren't going to give lp back. That's the most frustrating part of all this. Issues that are out of our control and yet we are punished for it lol. I followed 1-2 hours of steps they told me to take and nothing worked (including reinstalling league like they said). Waste of time and lp. This is just a big joke.","replies":[{"poster":"jonZooz","date":"2018-05-04T22:29:07.184+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's worst when you come back and you Play the game  and still help your team win u still get punished like wtf why should you get punished for joining back and helping your team win","replies":[{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-05-05T01:50:45.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's true. mb","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-05-04T11:55:29.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Atleast our issue happened before riot had a warning on the client, this guy chose to ignore it so it's really his fault. as for us, it's a diff story. fucking bullshit.","replies":[]}]}]}
