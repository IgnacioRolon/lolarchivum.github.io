They even don't bother to talk about it, like \"I am trolling, give no F\".\r\nI mean, I understand bad games, but not afk on purpose. And they are doing it for a long time. Reports don't work, Riot doesn't care about low elo. Can someone advise, what to do in order to get a better team? Not a skill base, but at least behavior. Also even if someone afk you still lose LP (not even a reduced amount). This is so unfair, I think.","replies":[{"poster":"Daymon","date":"2019-06-14T10:05:51.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Greetings Russian Dwarf!
