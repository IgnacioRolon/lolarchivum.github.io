I recognise a lot of the comments on this are going to be like &#039;Sucked in&#039;, I get it, I&#039;m an idiot but I hope that someone who is thinking of doing this doesn&#039;t do it!\r\n\r\nZel quit the game a while ago and said &#039;hey use my acc, I&#039;m quitting&#039; - now this acc had PAX Tf, so I was like &#039;heck yes!&#039; so, he had 4 other mates other than me using this account (I don&#039;t know why) so, I started to climb it a bit, casually playing, but people kept being toxic and it got chat banned AND people kept afking so it got like a 10 minute wait before each game.  So, I said to him that I&#039;d be interested in doing whatever it took to be the sole person who used the account.  He then came back to the play the game, lost 11 ranked games in a row and quit for good! \r\n\r\nSo, eventually only 2 people were sharing the account (he was a challenger player) and we were intending to rank it up to Masters, then out of the blue Zel says he&#039;s found a buyer and said &#039;you&#039;re a mate, I want to offer it to you first&#039; so, little did I know that he played both of us off of each other and was mythically auctioning the account.  We then settled on $350 AUD which I paid to his Runescape account, then he changed his password - deleted me off of everything.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s my fault, but I just want to make sure no one else falls for anything he says.  \r\n\r\nIGN: Zel\r\n\r\nIf Riot looks at this, we account shared 4 different people, then as far as I know he played at least 2 maybe 3 people off selling the account, potentially collecting $600+ AUD.  If the acc got banned I&#039;d be fairly happy about it.  :)  \r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\nGot screwed buying an account from a mate which had all PAX skins, just want to warn other people not to get duped.  \r\n\r\nYes yes, you deserve it, yes yes, I know.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-09T04:36:05.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202290340-Don-t-Buy-Accounts-\n\nIt looks like example three, except the seller got to keep the account. Best of both worlds for him?\n\nYou should probably remove mention of his IGN from this post, as that's against the [Universal Rules](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules) and might get you banned (from the forums, at least) yourself.\n\nBut your intention of preventing other players from making the same mistake is in good heart.","replies":[]}]}
