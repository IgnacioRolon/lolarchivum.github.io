It probably failed for another reason, but either way, your best bet is to submit a bug report (bottom right of the client). The more data they have on games where remakes are failing, the more reliable they can make it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pizzaxiaolongbao","date":"2019-04-01T03:06:33.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plus our hecarim didn't even reconnect at all and stayed at the fountain the whole time.","replies":[]}]}
