I was never arguing the other player's behaviour, if they did something worthy of punishment they will receive one in the same way that you have.

It wasn't a case of you quoting someone who said 'kys' or anything of the sort, so as far as your behaviour and your punishment is concerned, your log is all that is necessary, and all that should matter to you now, given you will likely never see those players again, and you are not responsible for their actions, only your own.\n\n>Back in the day of the old \" Tribunal system \"\n\nIt's for the reasons you listed and more that tribunal was removed, because it didn't work.\n\n>It has nothing to do with so called \" Privacy \"\n\nPolicies change when they are problematic.

It is due to the numbers\n\nIf that were the case then false punishments would be rampant. They aren't. If you were punished, you are either one of the *extremely* rare cases of false punishment because something you said or did triggered the system mistakenly, or you said or did something worthy of punishment. Data from *6 years ago* has little to no bearing on the present. I wasn't deep in the systems when they first came out, but like any system I imagine there were problems in it's infancy. That is essentially meaningless now.\n\n>So please do not lie or try and past off what you believe as fact when it is far from the fact.\n\nI could say the very same to you. You haven't offered any proof to the alternative, only data you (a single player) collected *6 years ago*.

Personally I feel the policy of the system is pretty good where it's at, but I more than welcome other perspectives. In my mind, if someone continues their negative behaviour despite 3 warnings (2 chat restrictions and a temp ban), then clearly they don't care about other players, and barely care about the consequences, so perma is really the only option left. That bearing in mind that they perma accounts and not players (certain very extenuating circumstances excepted).\n\n>I just don't think it's fair that if both parties were toxic one recieves a chat restriction and this fella has recieved a perm ban.\n\nThis ties into what I said above, but basically it comes down to whether or not you feel negative history should play a role in punishment. The system works on a yes answer to that, and personally I agree, in the same way that if someone steals something for the first time, you might let them off light with a bit of a scare, return of the property, and maybe a fine, but if they become a serial thief you have to take a harder stance. You seem to disagree, so I'd be interested to know what alternatives you would consider if you have any you feel would work.\n\n>reporting a player for being \"unskilled\" was an actual thing so calling someone bad is something that riot pretty much encouraged.\n\nThis is precisely why that option was removed, it was incredibly misleading. Being bad was never punishable, that report was meant as a cue for matchmaking to say \"hey, this person is consistently being matched with people too much more skilled than they are\", but inevitably people assumed that since it was reportable, it was also bannable which it never was, hence the change.\n\n>I see they've brought down the hammer on it but they've missed something\n\nIt's worth mentioning that any tactics they use have to be scaleable as well. Manual review simply can't keep up with the amount of players in the game anymore, so the automated system has to handle the brunt of the work. Something that would help 1% of punished players, while great if possible, isn't practically feasible to accomplish.\n\n>Can you answer on riots behalf why they won't bring the tribunal feature back? \n\nAs simply as possible, because it didn't work. \n\nTribunal is one of those things that sounds *great* in theory, but in practice fell apart. Punishments were almost universally too harsh, and tribunal required a near 100% Riot review rate as a result, making the whole player driven review thing almost entirely pointless, and putting all the burden on Riot anyway.\n\nYou can take boards as an example in fact, since a lot of people post logs with questions like \"was this fair/deserved etc\". You can see the very wide spectrum of opinions. \n\nSome people think words should never be punished because muting is a thing, some people think gameplay offences should be punished much harsher than it is (I agree it should be punished *faster* but that's more due to the limitations of the system). Some people feel hate speech is only ass bad as any other chat. Some people feel that perma chat restrictions are the absolute holy grail of punishments and should exist.\n\nEven with pretty explicit guidelines, getting all of those people to agree on a punishment? Just not gonna happen. Or alternatively finding people who fit the metrics Riot needs? Not scaleable, and at that point you should pretty much be hiring them, which again defeats the purpose of player driven review.\n\n>I saw you say something about they've tried the perm chat restriction and it failed miserably, could you link me to this?\n\nIt's hard to go back through all the old stuff and boards does not give an easy way to search unfortunately so this is what I have that's OCE specific. However, I think I may be mixing some information. I am unsure if there was formal testing of permanent chat restrictions, or if it just didn't line up with the reform policies Riot has in place. \n\nThe formal testing may have just been the level 20 challenge (returning perma'd accounts after a period of good behaviour) which had a whopping 95% relapse rate.\n\n_Chat restrictions serve two purposes:\n- to warn and reform players who are consistently unsportsmanlike (most chat restricted players never get another chat restriction)\n- to reduce the amount of harm an unsportsmanlike player can do in a given game._\n\n_The thing is: if a chat restricted player isn't reforming, then they're likely to keep using their limited chats for negativity and abuse which means they'll keep being reported anyway. Players who don't reform even while chat restricted, eventually end up permabanned. That is why you've got to focus on improving your own behaviour rather than relying on a partial shield like chat restrictions to prevent yourself from being banned._\n\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/99W0Zvji-i-am-speechless-picture-intensive?comment=00040000000100010000","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-15T11:13:43.864+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"With some help from the EU volunteers I've dug up some more specific info as well:\n\n>[75% of players tend to improve their behaviors after an initial verbal warning, and the rates of improvement just plummet after that.

Oh my. \nLet me make it as simple for you to understand this. \n\nIF EVERYONE HAS ALL THE CHAMPIONS AND ALL THE SKINS. HOW DO THEY MAKE MONEY?\n\nHacks4dayz when it was ban I had all the skins for champions I mostly play. So there for.. Making money from me on this account or any of my other accounts chances are very low even for my GF. She has a few accounts she leveled up.\nChances of her paying money for skins in very low.\nMeaning.. If you want to make money. You ban a player with all that money spent on champions. So when they level it up and start playing again.. Might take a month or so. But you will buy that skin. \n\nSo how does Riot make money again? New players I am sure you will claim. \nBut you really need to google. \n\n\n[{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=lQBqbd3u,comment-id=00010002000000000000,timestamp=2018-10-25T15:12:09.433+0000)\n>If they were 'money making bans' which doesn't really make much sense to begin with, I feel those numbers would be rather higher.\n\n\nROFLMAO..

You are so high you think Riots shit smells good.
