I got had a bit of a losing streak.. Like 9 games in a row. \r\nI won one to keep silver 5.

I maintain a nice KDA with good teams and sometimes with bad teams. So what do I have to do to keep silver other then win?\r\nBecause I cannot help that someone get autofilled and then say&#039;s &quot; Give me middle or I am trolling &quot; and trolls. This has happen more then I would like.\r\nSo how do I get rid of this shield thing and keep my rank?","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-12-04T14:06:37.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Win.\n\nDoesn't matter what your stats are, you can feed literally every game but win and you will climb.\n\nWhich is why ranked in LoL can be such an issue, your performance means literally nothing, your rank and MMR is 100% if you win or lose.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-12-07T01:10:15.760+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"well I mean on average if you have like a 60% winrate but don't do so well, you're probably still doing more things right than a guy who gets like 23 kills every game but has a 40% winrate.\n\nChasing KDA=/=better player.\n\nYeah sure a better player will decimate in a lower elo, stick a gold player in bronze 5 and watch them literally 1v5 pentakill under a tower (that was a kind of fun), but performance isn't just kda and stuff like alot of bronzies like to whine about, it isn't mechanical skill in lane, it isn't even winning your lane. The sign of a superior player to the rank is, consistently coming out ahead, earning alot of gold, impacting other lanes, making the right calls, ending relatively early and occasionally getting a pentakill, and most importantly winning the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TacoComes","date":"2018-08-27T04:59:33.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"it does means something.. If you cant climb it clearly means you're doing SOMETHING wrong. especially if you're stuck in bronze or silver. If you're stuck there. you probably have over a hundred things you could work on. In 100 games you don't have bad teammates in over 60 of your games, it's just how it is.\n\nFor YOU to rank up it depends on how you play. Better performance means more wins. In ALL you're games YOU are the deciding factor. You can't change how your teammates play then change how you play. Although some games are harder to carry than others. \n\nLeague is all about Making minimal mistakes and abusing others for their mistakes (by knowing your team's limits and the enemy's)","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2018-08-27T05:48:54.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And yet you completely ignore that your MMR is entirely based on if you win or lose.\n\nAgain your performance means nothing, every game only one thing matters and that's who wins.\nIf your team wins your MMR increases, if it loses your MMR decreases.\nIt doesn't matter how you win, it doesn't matter if you went 23/0/10 or 0/50/5 only the WIN/LOSS matters.\n\nThat's all that happens.\nYour performance has no impact on your MMR, if it did my MMR would be diamond according the stat comparisons available in the client now.\n\nPS: Fuck off with necroing a 9 month dead thread.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2017-12-04T17:17:55.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if you playing against bronze 5 players, im pretty sure you cannot get demoted as there is no qood teor below it.

The way it works is, after promotion to a new division, you can't be demoted unless you win a game, so if you win 1, then lose 2, you can get demoted back","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2017-12-07T00:35:15.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DarkShade918,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=vy0345VX,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-12-04T23:56:56.118+0000)\n>\n> You can get demoted from silver 5 back to bronze, it&#x27;s happened many times.
