Thats right you and your little butt buddy have no idea how much 1 CS is worth all you worry about is what your dumb little stats say on some web site \"\n\nTo Riot..

However, he has been given a chance to reform in the public eye, and it looks like he is doing pretty well. Hopefully this will continue and will inspire all his impressionable followers to do the same. \n\nYour accounts were banned rightfully for toxicity, and the bans won't be taken away.

HECK I can even change my Mac address making tthe so called person ban pointless to being with.\n\nWhat they have done in fact is allow him to play ONLINE / Stream the game.

Only those who watch his stream for that very reason (literally his whole gimmick is being insane) are watching it, and yet are not forced to do so which leads me to not understanding when you say:\n\n>What they have done in fact is allow him to play ONLINE / Stream the game.

There is literally nothing at all stopping you from making new accounts and getting them to level 30 and continuing to play and contribute to the community in a positive manner. \nFor him there was. \n\nWhen his person ban was issued, they were looking to ban any of his accounts regardless if he was streaming or not. That's kind of the point. They didn't want someone with such big reach and negative behavior to play the game in any capacity. It wasn't an IP ban because like you pointed out, those are easy AF to get around these days, and video game companies do tend to avoid IP bans so they don't screw over PC bangs and such. They were literally tracking Tyler1 as a person, likely through his play patterns (high elo draven 1 tricks are relatively rare) and banning the accounts as they came to notice. \n\nYou owned up to the point of being toxic. \nGood on you. \n\nYou must realize that you were punished, and were actually likely given a warning first to knock off your behavior. You chose not to do so, and now must live with the consequences. \n\nAnd just like I have been saying the entire time, Tyler1 was unbanned as a person and can now make accounts to play the game. **His old accounts are forever locked with all the money he and his fans invested in them and will never be released because his punishments were rightfully administered inline with community values. **\n\n>.
