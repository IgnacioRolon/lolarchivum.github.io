What is to say that the human behind the comp does not have 100 other bots doing the same thing at the same time? If rito went and banned them all individually, then little comes of it.

They take smite and heal. They will go grom. Base. Go over the river to grom. Base. Then blue buff. Base. Then over the river take blue buff. Base.\n\nSee what i mean? When you level a new account the easy and fastest XP is 100% wins. That is going bots. End the game with into 15 mins and move onto the next one for fast XP.\n\nBut when you are the only player with 4 bots. It does get a bit insane when they are all doing what I said before.\nThis is a very easy way to detect bot players.\nARAM are the same again. They run up the lane just before minion wave has spawn and will wait for the very last minion. Then follow it into fight. Once it dies the bot will again run back to the next wave follow the last minion as it goes in. \n\nOnce they die.. { Which they will a lot } they will go and wait for the wave and follow the last one again.\n\nYou cannot say \" They need to check the coding input to see how they are doing it \" WHEN IT IS RIGHT THERE.\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}\n\n\nEdit.\n\nI bet 100% if they were botting rank. They would be ban with in seconds of the report.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-27T08:27:08.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If they ban the accounts individually as they spawn, then at the very least the botters have to make their programs act like normal human being's, in which case, who the fuck really cares at that point, at least they aren't playing like retards, and ruining the gaming experience.\n\nAs for the lawsuit you decided to pull up, League# was never the main botting group, it was just the only one Riot could legitmately target.\n\noh and let's face it, they haven't done anything useful by not banning the single accounts, if they do that, it means both the botters and Riot have to advance technology, which is actually the same thing that happens against many botting practices in other games.","replies":[{"poster":"CritTheClit","date":"2017-11-27T09:22:46.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"yes but then you have the same thing as runescape ..... until a blackhat become a whitehat.\nalso would you like to then see bots out ranking u?\n:) i wouldnt","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-27T10:09:34.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"#scripting.","replies":[{"poster":"CritTheClit","date":"2017-11-27T22:34:46.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"**so are going to answer?**","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-28T00:04:50.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just did, your just a little too dense to realise i did, fact is \"bots out ranking us\" that would be scripters, which already happens.\n\nWhich mind you is also on the players to find.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lejeus","date":"2017-11-30T03:15:44.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is a really crazy idea, implement a Captcha check to queue for your game.

I also think this should be done.\nI leveled a new account for something I am working on and when you level in bots. It is really 4 bots vsing bots. I am the only player. They seem to just head into jungle now instead of lane.\n\nBut in ARAM they are ranked player's that are just flat out cheating for the XP reward.\nSo have a Captcha check is a good idea. But it would become insanely overwhelming if you only play ARAM.
