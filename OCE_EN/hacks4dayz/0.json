I just hate people that think they are so great because of a ranking.\nI havent done rank. But in SC2 when it first came out I was Diamond. Then in S2 I was Diamond again. But I never told anyone of a lower tier \" Bronze mentality \" \n\nThey have just as much right as others to say what they want from a game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-01-30T08:13:28.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Lol ok just saying ur mentality bad :) that’s all ... your definition of toxic seems to be a lot different from mine but that’s ok we can have different views on toxicity.\n\nI was merely saying that blaming your teams all the time isn’t the best idea imo.. you can really improve as a player if you accept your mistakes and not always blame people ... when you lose think about what you could have done better to win the game not what your teammates did wrong to lose the game.... \n\nI will not result to calling you ‘bronze trash’ because you are not.. you are merely players in the transitional period of ranked and I think you can both benifit from my advice as it will definitely get you out of the depths of elo hell (assuming you want to climb).\n\nI’m nowhere near pro for the record I’m just a trashy plat player and I did look at your history and if you want my honest opinion it is all good but there is room for improvement definitely whether it be less deaths or builds in situational games that could possibly have resulted in a win in losing games... but yes overall your kda winrate looks good and if you continue you can def climb.... \n\nPlease refrain from lashing out at me just trying to help. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Hacks4Dayz","date":"2018-01-30T11:21:04.923+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MysticLlamaZ,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=ovlBqH3e,comment-id=0000000000000001,timestamp=2018-01-30T08:13:28.980+0000)\n>\n> Lol ok just saying I am  mentality bad :) I like to think I am better then others \n>\n\nFix it for you.\nI agree here. Plat or not just saying \" Bronze Mentality \" is far from help. In fact.. It is more of a toxic statement.\nIt is what you call \" Passive aggressive \" which what I was ban for and what you have just used and then justified.\n\nSince I am Bronze.. Not silver or gold. You automatically go to the \" BRONZE SUCK \" or in your case \" mentality bad \". Well I am sorry I don't play this game non stop and learn what +9 ad at level one means in damage.\n\nBut the fact remains.. It seems like Riot is trying to tilt me because I ggot a 10 game chat ban. I have had 10 accounts go through this. 10 game chat ban turns into a prema really quick. For the smallest of things.\nThe fact I got a 10 game chat ban then a 2 day losing streak. Then promos and then loss due to troll's / toxic people / Feeders. Made me wonder. \nBut now I regret even coming to the forums in anyway. So congratz brah. You have one less bronze on the forums.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-01-30T16:06:07.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not nice to quote incorrect things...\n\nAnd if you think those bans and chat restrictions were for nothing, I can already tell you are lying to yourself.\n\nI didn’t go to the conclusion that you’re hardstuck bronze and have a ban mentality... all u got to do is read ur post to see you have a bad mentality.... \n\nBut sure if you can’t take useful criticism then don’t use boards fine by me.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-01-30T16:10:13.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly feel like you guys are trolling tbh actually","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2018-01-30T19:28:02.715+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MysticLlamaZ,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=ovlBqH3e,comment-id=0000000000000001000000000000,timestamp=2018-01-30T16:10:13.120+0000)\n>\n> Honestly feel like you guys are trolling tbh actually\n\nYeah they are now, but you sid start off at the throat. They know they are at the bottom and you re enforced it it a derogatory way. So they swiched off from what evee you had to say. Im bronze, idc though. I love the game and play for fun,  not for a badge. \nIf you got rid of your first post they probably would of listened.\nMost low elo guys know they can only improve themselves, but choose to blame others. What i think they are trting to say, is its harder for team coheasion in bronze because of the crap attitude of a high percentage vs higher elo. \nThats something i would agree on as iv got others who are high elo and have seen the games. \n\nApparently from the pros silver is the hardest rank to get out of, then bronze. (As ok mechanics can carry you out alone). I'll try and find the link.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
