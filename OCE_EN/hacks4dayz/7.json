ONE OF THEM WAS THE FACT I SAID \" Bad words are auto detected \". \nBecause if Riot is taking this zero stand on F or S words. Then this game is about to lose everyone that plays this game. Everyone at some point will say Fing moron or something along the lines of that. \n\nBut hey.. I guess when you can see it is the same people from both games that have reported you. I guess..

IT IS MY HONOR I am very.. provoke about.\nWhen it comes to Riot and bans they give it to the wrong people.\nI was angry. I was being a bit of a simpleton yes. But to take my honor away... That has made a simple issue of think before you act up.. To more of a massive battle.\n\nHonor to some is useless. But I play WW.. On my old account I had every skin but one. I can only get the one skin that I want from honor now. \n\nSo not only has Riot said \" You need to settle down. \" but they have also said \" You won't get any closer to the goal of Medieval Warwick \"\nThis is what has provoke me to be come.. Less than nice right now. \n\nI understand they pointed out somethings. But it still doesn't lessen the fact of the ban for what is very little.\nI in fact in 3 games today have reported more toxic then me. All of them are playing.\nBeing told \" My support is so sht. My support is just bad. Why do you even play rank if your going to be so bad \" or the good old \" Go play bots. You are trash \"\n\nThat is 100% more toxic then me. But yet they are still playing. I am still stuck at level 1 honor for god knows how long.. \n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-27T04:14:27.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Consider this though. Why would dishonourable behaviour get you honour rewards? You obviously don't think your chat is all that severe, and certainly we've all seen worse, but that doesn't change *your* behaviour.\n\nA complete honour drop may be a bit harsh, but we also don't have the full story as other players. Maybe you trolled for a bit in game, or maybe you have a long history of fairly mundane or inconsistent negativity and this was just the final straw that actually got you punished. Without that information we can only speculate.\n\nEither way, even with only neutral behaviour it doesn't take that long to climb back through the honour levels, and given the timing you have the whole season to accomplish that. This punishment, and the honour drop that comes with it should be prompting you to look at your behaviour and work back towards being honourable.\n\nIf you're struggling to shrug off other people's less than savoury behaviour when it shows itself then just mute all when you get into game for a while, or just mute at the first sign of it and make a note to report it. You can communicate just about everything with pings now.\n\nNot to mention that unlike last season you are now guaranteed to get either Grey Warwick or Medieval Twitch when you hit honour 5, instead of just having a tiny chance at them in every capsule.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-01-27T02:07:38.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dw you got whole year","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-01-26T07:48:36.747+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"We need a tribunal so people like myself who aren't sensitive little bitches can not deem this as a punishable offense.
