Adding a new way bar for the level 1 would help a lot of people that have gotten chat ban like my self.\n\nBecause right now I dont know if I need 100 honor or 10 honor to achieve level 2 honor or not. I have seen some people say that they have been on level one for almost 6 months.\nThat to me seems a bit insane but lets face it. I got a 10 game chat ban about 30 games ago now and I haven&#039;t gotten any chat ban or anything since but I am still level 1.\n\nHow many honor do I need to get level 2 and start going higher? All I see is a lock. Am I continuously locked at 1 now for going tilt in 2 games. \nThat seems to be a bit over the top for what I have done.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-29T01:21:50.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the shortest amount of time I've heard of someone getting from honour 1 to 2 was about 3 weeks, and that was with pretty consistent positivity. Being neutral will take you a bit longer of course, and if you slip up from time to time it'll slow you down a bit as well. Remember that even for players starting at level 2 checkpoint 3, this is meant to be a season long achievement, it's not going to be the quickest thing to get.","replies":[{"poster":"Hacks4Dayz","date":"2018-01-29T02:00:34.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=H3FulxvE,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-01-29T01:21:50.662+0000)\n>\n> I think the shortest amount of time I&#x27;ve heard of someone getting from honour 1 to 2 was about 3 weeks, and that was with pretty consistent positivity.

My gril.. She plays ARAM and every now and then goes into rank. But she is level 4 honor now.\nSeason started little while ago. But she goes up in honor like no tomorrow.\nTotally confused.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-29T03:46:02.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ARAM games are quicker, meaning more honor over the same amount of time.\n\nAnd generally you will see 5 honor's used in ARAM more then Summoners Rift (at least from personal experience.)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-29T10:59:16.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that I think about it I've noticed the same (though I don't play much ARAM), I never really considered that ARAM only or mostly players would gain honour a lot faster.

I saw some post about if your reported for anything it makes you go back to the start. I was tilted. But I wasn't completely toxic. Now from what I have seen on NA forums / Reddit and so on.\nI wont ever be going up in honor. This in it's self is even more tilting and makes me want to just say \" ^%&%& \"","replies":[]}]}]}
