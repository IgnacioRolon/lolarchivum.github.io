Because the players name is blacked out.\r\nMy Question is this.. Does support ticket about this really work. All I get when I do is the basic reply of \r\n\r\n&quot; Thank you for this report! I am really sorry for the bad experience this player has created for you.\r\n\r\nWe can&rsquo;t often take action on reports sent to us through tickets and we usually do not take responsibility for conflicts that happen in the private chat/pre-game lobby/post game lobby, but rest assured, we will investigate further this player&#039;s behavior. I am sorry, but due to privacy reasons I will not be able to disclose any information regarding the conclusion of our investigation.\r\n\r\nAlso, please make sure to use our report feature each time you encounter a player that is negatively impacting your game. Each report brings violators of the Summoner&#039;s Code one step closer to punishment and, hopefully, toward reformed behavior.\r\n\r\nYou&rsquo;ll occasionally, but not always, get messages from the IFS letting you know that a player you reported has been punished. Keep reporting inappropriate behavior and we&rsquo;ll make sure negative actions have consequences! &quot;\r\n\r\nI understand Riot has templates that are approved because they have to be &quot; Professionals &quot; about it. but sometimes I wish I would get a reply of &quot; Damn dude. We are getting on to that.

But what happened in the game just made me quit and go play something else. My toplaner would do absolutely nothing when I tried to gank and I just ended up 1v1ing the enemy laner until I couldn't beat him so I ran away. I was met with question pings and my toplaner just flaming me in chat. By the end of the game it didn't go so well for me and my whole team was going off at me. My adc calls me \"autistic\", the support thresh calls me and idiot and a troll and other stupid stuff. Then I get into the post game lobby and I call them out on being toxic and bullies and the enemy team decides to agree with them saying \"Who wouldn't report a Nasus jungle, what a troll\". My team sees this as a chance to continue flaming me and I just end up reporting them all. Of course I know nothing is going to be done against these people so I make an effort to send in a support ticket with all their names visible and the stuff they said in post-game lobby.\n\nStill haven't gotten a response yet, Riot's probably gonna skim over it and use their good ol' CTRL + V","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-30T07:54:22.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Autistic isn't on the list, so i guess they are safe.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-29T07:30:45.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've played since season 2, and only once have I ever had the message \"a player has been punished due to your report\" or whatever it is.\n\nI never report out of spite, only for legit reasons.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-29T12:18:20.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that until a bit over a year ago they were way more dodgy than they are now.

To me that notification is real important, and shouldn't just feel like a side note priority wise. Feedback that reports actually do something is what gets players to report, which catches more negative behaviour. The number of people that say \"I don't bother to report\" just because there's no explicit feedback is frustrating, and fixing and expanding that notification would alleviate a lot of that.\n\nI also think investing in a warning notification when you've been validly reported (but not enough for punishment) is worthwhile for those minor cases of toxicity that escalate over time, and while I think a chat restriction is a worthy warning, I think there needs to be something that shows when they *start* to cross the line, not when they actually cross it. Maybe another tier of chat restriction that has lesser restrictions and doesn't affect your honour/rewards given that players and popups don't mix.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hacks4Dayz","date":"2018-01-29T08:01:09.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=QAPLA,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=6Edodlcq,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-01-29T07:30:45.579+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;ve played since season 2, and only once have I ever had the message &quot;a player has been punished due to your report&quot; or whatever it is.\n> \n> I never report out of spite, only for legit reasons.\n\nThis is why I am asking. I report people.. A lot. I miss the old Unskilled option. Because with that you can report someone for being unskilled. Meaning you are saying \" They are not trolling or inting. Just very unskilled for this level \" allowing Riot to move them to a different group pool.\nNow it seems.
