CANT REDOWNLOAD GAME","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so this all started yesterday when i decided to play a game of league. I went to open the application (which was in my applications folder at the time) and i got the message saying \"unexpected error, check logs for more information\". This happened every time i opened it and wouldn't even load the lol launch page. So i decided ill redownload the game. I uninstalled league of legend off of my mac and deleted anything file related to it. I then went on to the website where i was encountered with a problem. When i clicked \"download the game, Macintosh Oce\" the page wouldn't load. It would take a few seconds of trying to load it, then say it was an error. This is the actual game download link (http://l3cdn.riotgames.com/Mac_ShellInstaller/OC1/League%20of%20Legends%20OC1.dmg). After trying over and over again to access this page i finally gave up and went to the support tab to submit a token. The thing is, every single aspect of the league of legends oce website works for me, except the support tab and the link to download the game. Please friends help a brotha out. If it makes any difference, i tried downloading with safari firefox and my default broswer chrome.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-11T00:01:04.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems that a lot of people on Mac are also experiencing this.\n\nRito stuffed up good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alain484","date":"2015-01-10T00:10:02.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"一樣!!!
