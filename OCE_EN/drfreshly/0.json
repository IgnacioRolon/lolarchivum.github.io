Turns out my friends were contacting me on social media but i had no way to see it. when i got back i found loads of msg about this guy and that hes going to get my account banned. I load the client for the first time in nearly 2 years to find my account was perma banned.\n\n   I went to customer support to look into my account being hacked. But because my account is perma banned for being toxic, riot support wont help me any further. I have never received a penalty till now and i don't know how i'm at fault. \n\n  I'm frantic and losing my mind over this situation, any help would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-05-11T07:44:32.955+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submit an **account recovery** ticket through support. You'll have to be logged out to do this. They'll ask you a bunch of questions to verify ownership of the account. Once the account is verified and secured, they will typically revoke the punishment that was issued as a result of the compromise.","replies":[{"poster":"Kahliss","date":"2019-05-13T00:20:28.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey again Seras Dragon, nope they say they still cant help. there has to be a way to prove that was not me nor did i allow this to happen.

There are a number of other reasons they may have denied this, ultimately it is up to their discretion. Given that they can see heaps of backend info and we can't, I can't even really speculate as to the exact reason sorry.\n\nThe best you can probably hope for it to ask for your ticket to be reviewed/escalated (if it hasn't already been), and get a second opinion. They can and may still say no.\n___\n\nEDIT: So from your other post, it sounds like you're in a bit of a tricky situation. Thing is, in situations like yours, there isn't much to distinguish your usage from the usage of the intruder, and no way of knowing whether you shared the account or it was actually accessed without your permission.\n\nIt seems like he probably used a keylogger, and no, there is no way for Riot to know that because it's purely local and doesn't actually interact with the client.\n\nIf they recovered accounts like this, a lot of legitimately permabanned players could claim their friend or roommate was on the account without permission to get their account back.\n\nUnfortunately, this is why the physical security of the account is the responsibility of the owner. I don't know if there's anything more support can do for you in this case.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kahliss","date":"2019-05-11T17:05:43.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Seras Dragon! thank you for your advice, i just submitted a ticket. i put as much info as i can remember. &lt;3\n(dr.freshly)","replies":[]}]}]}
