Usally I wait out 5mins till game is loaded in otherwise if i close leauge it will force me as a dodge and loose LP. Any help appreciated. Pretty sure its when leauge has been opened for awhile and memory starts going above 200,000k in task manager. Wonder if there is a way to keep the memory down.
