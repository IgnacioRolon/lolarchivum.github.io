However, there isn't any indication as to what punishment they get. For example: An AFK player is at base and repeats this behaviour throughout their games. They'll be put into the low priority queue. Can we see that they're in the Low Priority queue? No, but they do have a punishment.\n\nA permanent ban can happen in two ways: a previous 14 day ban or extreme negative behaviour. If you feel like this wasn't a fair ban you can contact [Riot Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). I don't want to discourage you but keep in mind \"Suspensions from the Instant Feedback System are generally not lifted or adjusted. However, if you feel you received an inappropriate penalty, reach out to Player Support to discuss it.

Things like insulting and tearing down other players, giving up, and a consistent negative attitude are things that can result in action being taken.
