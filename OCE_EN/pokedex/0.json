I don&#039;t have problems with other games such as BF4 and such.\nThe freeze is so bad to a point where I have to hold the power button to restart my PC. I just want to know is there a fix for this? \nAlso, this happened only after the patch 5.10. I have reinstalled my drivers, updated my windows, ran a hardware diagnostics and reinstalled the game but it still happens.\nMY PC specs are\nWindows 8.1 \ni7-4790\n8gb ram\nGTX 745\n250gb SSD","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-31T02:55:26.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you mean by \"freezes\"?

When I was playing before, I decided to open up Task Manager and saw that League was taking up *all* of my RAM. Not that it was slowing down or anything, but I do see how something like this could be causing issues on other computers.\n\nHave you tried force-closing the client after the game begins loading? It's not required to play the game, and takes up a huge chunk of memory just sitting there, so it might be worth force-closing it via Task Manager as soon as the game begins loading. Be warned, though, you won't go into the post-game lobby (thus not be able to honour or report any players) and you'll have to re-log.\n\nThe shortcut to Task Manager in Windows is Ctrl+Shift+Esc.","replies":[{"poster":"Pokedex","date":"2015-06-01T02:19:46.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll try it...
