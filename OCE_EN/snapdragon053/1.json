Details below.\n\nAatrox is falling into the pool of champions that no one wants to play because there are champions that are simply better. I&#039;d prefer him to be in the most-played-champions list. Now it&#039;s a pretty sad feeling to get dumped into your passive by a merciless Darius that hooked you out of your flash or Q, only to revive and be instantly chopped by the relentless Noxian. You swish swash your sword at him, hoping to sustain enough to survive him, but 90% of the time he&#039;s already charged his Q and there&#039;s no chance.\nAlongside a few changes to Aatrox&#039;s Q and W and an awesome effect on his E and ult, his new passive is designed to give him a fighting chance if he&#039;s losing, and keep him from dying if he's winning. Here&#039;s the idea I had for him.\n\nAatrox, The Darkin Blade\n\nPassive- Darkin Emblem\nAatrox stores power from slain enemies in the Darkin Emblem, increasing his lifesteal and attack speed for every life he takes. Each minion and monster slain grants 0.25% attack speed and 0.1% lifesteal. If Aatrox kills a champion with the Blade of the Darkin active, he gains 0.5% attack speed and 0.2% lifesteal. Aatrox's attack speed and lifesteal bonus are doubled for 10 seconds after exiting Blood Rush.\n\nActive- Blood Rush.\nAatrox enters stasis when dropping below 10% maximum health and becomes invulnerable, regenerating 10% of health lost over the last 3 seconds. After 3 seconds the stasis affecting Aatrox is broken, and all enemies in an area around are feared for 1.5 seconds and take damage magic equal to his current health. (270 second cooldown).\n\nQ- Dark Flight.\nAatrox leaps into the air and dives to the ground at a target location. If he encounters an enemy champion he knocks them up for 0.25 seconds and deals 30/65/100/135/170 + (90% bonus AD) physical damage. (16/15/14/13/12 second cooldown).\n\nW- Blade of the Darkin.\n\nPassive.\nAatrox drains the life from his foes, stealing 2/4/6/8/10% of their current health on every third basic attack and dealing physical damage equal to health gained + (80% bonus AD).\n\nActive.\nAatrox loses his health gain in exchange for 100/125/150/175/200 extra range on basic attacks. The next target hit by Aatrox's basic attack is slowed by 35% and takes an additional 2/4/6/8/10% of their missing health + (80% bonus AD) as magic damage. The passive portion of the ability activates after Aatrox uses his active attack. 18.5/17/15.5/14/12.5 second cooldown.\n\nE- Anguish.\nAatrox slashes towards enemy, dealing 90/130/170/210/250 (100% bonus AD). Enemies in an area behind the target take 25% reduced damage and are slowed by 15/20/25/30/35% for 1 second.\n\nR- Massacre.\nAatrox channels for one second before drawing in the blood of all surrounding enemy champions, dealing 250/375/500+ (100% AP). Afterwards, Aatrox is embraced by shadows of damaged enemy champions who attack his target, dealing 60% reduced damage for 10 seconds. 110/95/80 second cooldown.\n\nWell, what did you think? Did you like the ult effect? Just to clarify, they have no health or movement speed or anything. I'd say they're something between Azir's Sand Soldier's and Mordikaiser's ult. All they do is basic attack the target that Aatrox has attacked last. \nThis is just my idea, and I'd enjoy having this kind of champion in the game. I'd like to see what kind of response this guy gets, please comment your opinion and what you think I might have overloaded or made a bit too op.","replies":[{"poster":"Stew52","date":"2015-10-03T11:22:21.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps put a leveling  ratio on the % ad on his W passive (40%/50%/60%/70%/80%) if done so you can increase it to go up to perhaps 120% bonus ad. Put a hp cost on his abilities like the old Aatrox so that he has some risk to his rewards but not on his ult as champions that use hp to case spells don't have a cost on their ult. Keep Aatrox E as his iconic triangle skill shot but keep the changes other than that. His ult is like poppys? You didn't clearly state how it works. His passive is old blood thirster as well, This is good. Another thing is that you didn't take in consideration is his lore (Unless riot changed it) he empowers is allies with his great deeds on the battle field, filling them with blood lust as they watch him slaughter the enemy try to take this in to consideration. The knock up on his Q is too short for such a long cool-down as well. \"Aatrox is embraced by shadows\"? He isn't Nocturne or Zed, he doesn't deal with shadows. Blood rush can't be an active as you can't activate a passive. Other than the things I pointed out pretty good.\n\nYeah this is a wall of text so TD;LR: There is nothing connecting him to his lore and needs some number changes and clarity on what the skill-shots are or how the work.","replies":[{"poster":"Snapdragon053","date":"2015-10-03T11:38:43.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dear sir.\nI do like constructive criticism but you've pointed out lots of things that weren't missing, but you've decided that could be an addition. Also, skimming my post and missing the note I added about not having the more refined stats on the page, then continuing on with the comment you put up kind of sounds a bit dumb. Just go with what's on the page and criticize that, don't criticize what's NOT there.\nThanks and have a lovely evening.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Suki no Sukiru","date":"2015-09-30T21:19:05.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yo um the active of bloodrush healing is 10%... thats like 60hp at level 1 and around 200 at lategame... how about at least 30 or 40%..or a flat amount.","replies":[{"poster":"Snapdragon053","date":"2015-10-03T10:51:10.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=littleganker,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=1uEAPv8Z,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-09-30T21:19:05.193+0000)\n>\n> yo um the active of bloodrush healing is 10%... thats like 60hp at level 1 and around 200 at lategame... how about at least 30 or 40%..or a flat amount.\n\nYeah, it was supposed to be 10% of max health \"plus\" 10% of recent damage taken. So it promotes a tanky build to Aatrox while having decent dps and sustain from his passive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Snapdragon053","date":"2015-10-03T08:55:16.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, been having troubles with my net for the past few days.\nYeah I accidently uploaded a separate page for Aatrox. I have a much more refined one that I'll be adding soon.
