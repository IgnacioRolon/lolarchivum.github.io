He makes for a strong mid laner, and is also designed for an exiting life in bot lane. Here are his abilities:\r\n\r\nPassive - Promise of Power:\r\nGrim draws power from slaying enemies or assisting in their demise. Grim gains an additional 1% of his ability power for every kill he secures or assists in.  He also gains movement speed equal to 5% of his passive bonus.\r\n\r\nQ - Dreadful Lance:\r\n(60/75/90/115/130 mana). Grim sends a shadow entwined shard into the air which lands at a target area 1 second later. The projectile deals 60/90/120/150/180 + (60% AP) magic damage. A black miasma spreads from the impact of the spear, dealing 30/45/60/75/90 + (60% AP) magic damage and slowing targets that remain in the area by 30% after 2 seconds. \r\n10/9.5/9/8.5/8 second cooldown.\r\n\r\nW - Deathgrasp:\r\n(70 mana). Grim summons a spectre that haunts a target enemy champion for 4 seconds. Dark chains latch onto the target and slow by 10/15/20/25/30%, increasing to double slow if the target continues moving before the ability ends. The target takes 30/50/70/90/110 + (20% AP) magic damage if they continued moving. \r\n24/22/20/18/16 second cooldown.\r\n\r\nE - Fright:\r\n(50/55/60/65/70 mana). Grim is cloaked in a deadening aura, reducing attacker&#039;s damage and movement speed by 3/6/9/12/15%. Activating Fright causes a tremor to echo out from Grim in a target direction. All enemies affected by Fright take 70/100/130/160/190 + (35/37.5/40/42.5/45% AP) magic damage and are debuffed by Fright, causing Grim&#039;s next basic attack to fear them for 1.1/1.2/1.3/1.4/1.5 seconds.\r\n19/18/17/16/15 second cooldown.\r\n\r\nR - Doom:\r\n(100/150/200 mana). Grim releases a ghastly howl towards a target enemy champion, rooting it (in terror) for 2 seconds and dealing 200/300/400 + (75% AP) magic damage to it. All enemies behind the target take 100/200/300 + (60% AP) magic damage and are slowed by 90%, decaying over 2 seconds.\r\n150/125/100 second cooldown.\r\n\r\nWell there&#039;s my second champ design (my first was a rework idea for Aatrox, check it out if you want), how did you find Grim? Very reaper-ish in my opinion, although I don&#039;t want him to be based in the Shadow Isles; he seems more fitting to be coming from the realms that Shaco and Nocturne sprung from. Just like my last post, please be sure to comment and give me some feedback on the champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Snapdragon053","date":"2015-10-03T09:48:05.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By the way, unless it's a champ that i'm really intent on getting Riot to notice, I probably won't be putting base value stats on most champs ideas that I have.\nFor 1. I think it's fine, even though it's doubtful that Riot will notice my champ ideas, that they can have to power to muck around with base stats and see what works for the champion. And 2. Sometimes I think that some champions don't need armour, movespeed, mr, base ad etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Suki no Sukiru","date":"2015-10-04T06:39:58.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"?","replies":[{"poster":"Snapdragon053","date":"2015-10-04T09:02:23.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a personal joke, don't worry","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SilentXKiller","date":"2015-10-03T09:54:38.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great, hope you can change his name, since Grim sounds a bit boring and Master Of Nightmares is already taken by that nasty Nocturne {{champion:56}}, also, it would be good to scale his abilities down a bit so they don't do too much damage I suggest from 60% to probably 55 or 50%. About the names i suggest: Phantasm the White Shadow, Phobia the Dream Tormentor, Despair the Reverent Dark??? Just some ideas I came up with, you can switch them around if you want, hope this helps!!!\nPlease check my pages!!!\nCheers, have a great day!\nSilentXKiller","replies":[{"poster":"Snapdragon053","date":"2015-10-03T10:10:36.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although Nocturne's title is 'the Eternal Nightmare, I like the title Reverent Dark, perhaps i'll mix that with a different name. His abilities actually used to have a much smaller scaling but I thought I might get comments asking to up them a bit.
