You can imagine this is infuriating for not only me but other people in my games, so I stopped playing after I tried to play a ranked game and could not connect. Previous to this, I&#039;d been placed in a 10 minute waiting time low priority queue, because of this lag.\r\nI decided last night to play a cheeky Co-op vs AI match to see if my internet was any better, and guess what; 5 minutes in, 2000ms ping. I then tell the other people in the bot match (who seemed experienced enough) that i had to leave as i was unable to play. I woke up this morning to find that i&#039;ll have to sit 5 matches in a 20 minute low priority queue... over an HOUR AND A HALF of just waiting.\r\n\r\nIs there anyway this can be removed, or do I have to sit for 20 minutes 5 times before my games?","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Soul Slayer","date":"2015-09-29T04:01:38.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I felt your pain and i think they should reduce time depending on your ping ingame throughout your game and see when you left and what type of game e.g:co-op vs ai should be like probably the penalty is reduced about 50% and a few more depending on your ping.","replies":[]}]}
