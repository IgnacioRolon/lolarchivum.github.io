Doesn't seem like they would have any reason to.\n\nAlso, by using OpenDNS to play League, even though you've expressed that you want to bypass it, is breaking the EULA.","replies":[{"poster":"CookieCutaSharkZ","date":"2015-04-19T08:22:10.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think you know what OpenDNS is. It's some sort of network parental control thing which blocks all games including league. There's nothing to just \"close.\" You say that it's breaking the EULA, what is that? and how am i breaking it?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-19T10:47:17.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right when you say I don't know what OpenDNS is. I was just making assumptions. But they seem to have been correct.\n\nOk, so from I gather OpenDNS is a service in which your computer must route through in order to get access to the internet OR it is the address all internet sources requested by your computer must go through to use it. In other words, it's acting as a proxy, which is against the EULA. You aren't allowed to use proxies or VPNs to play League on. It involves being able to access data that you're not supposed to, being charged extra for no reason and an invasion of privacy (including Riot) that the best solution was to just make everyone agree not to use it.\n\nNevertheless you won't be pursued or banned because you are using it.\n\nNow, if OpenDNS is a 'network parental control thing', then does that mean someone else is purposefully preventing you from playing online video-games? If so, why not just ask them to deactivate it?","replies":[{"poster":"CookieCutaSharkZ","date":"2015-04-27T01:22:12.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OpenDNS is not a proxy. And it does not act like a proxy in any way. But let's say it was. This 'proxy' is preventing me from playing league, which means I'm most definately not breaking the EULA  because I would need to actually be playing league to actually be breaking any rule. \n\nWhen i 'request' for internet sites and etc. What probably happens is first it checks with opendns whether or not it categorises with a blocked site or not. Then if not it allows me through. If this was a proxy, it would probably completely shatter my internet speed considering Opendns is located somewhere in the USA and I obviously am nowhere near there.\n\nAnd finally. Yes I have tried already to reason with the admin.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-29T10:09:52.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, I understand what you mean now. It's simply the place which your computer searches for when it looks up addresses. It specifically does not have an entry for Riot Games's server, preventing you from playing the game.\n\nI do not endorse purposefully undermining your administrator.\n\n[But I'll just leave this here.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
