It was like heaven, no trolls want to queue up and wait an extra 5 minutes to play, so the game had a LOT less trolls overall.\r\n\r\nOur community has a buttload of people now and could definitely support it, I mean if you can justify adding Team Builder you can DEFINITELY add draft mode.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m also sick of vsing a Fiora every game and being able to ban her would be swell and lovely.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, if you support let Riot know in the comments. Not really interested in negative comments from people who want to tell me to suck it up and play ranked or to play normals or what this would make other queues longer (which it wouldn&#039;t, look at teambuilder..)","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-08-31T10:20:10.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly Riot probably wants to do this, but they need a larger player base. I don't know if you've played team builder recently, but unless you play at peak hours, you could be waiting up to an hour and a half for a support. This pretty much shows how we just need more people playing, before we can have some of these queues.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-08-31T11:52:35.560+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No it doesn't, if they can justify keeping us having TB (Draft got pulled for shorter queues), then they damn well can give us draft.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BadMrFrostie","date":"2015-08-31T06:15:17.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This + 24/7 ranked is what I miss about being on NA...

I think they should remove Team Builder altogether and replace it with Draft. Still the same amount of queues then, and hell, we'd probably steal back a bit of the player base who play on the NA server to play Draft!\nAlso with the free transfers from NA to OCE we should have more people playing now, shouldn't we?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-08-31T12:10:10.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Our community has a buttload of people now and **could definitely support it**\n\nOh definitely, what with out 20/7 ranked, 30/3 Normal Twisted Treeline, almost completely unused 20/7 Teambuilder with 30+ minute queues, complete lack of Ranked Twisted Treeline, complete lack of Crystal Scar **and** off-peak ARAM queues up to 20 minutes...
