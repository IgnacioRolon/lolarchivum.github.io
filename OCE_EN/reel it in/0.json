If they didn't have Yasuo (975 RP) or the Project Yasuo skin (1350 RP) they'd ***HAVE*** to make another purchase of RP to complete the set (assuming they don't have RP already sitting in their account).\n\nLucky for me I already have Yasuo (and the Project: Yasuo skin) as well as Master Yi, saving me 2,585 RP, and 12,752 IP that could get me Lucian and Zed (both worth 975 RP or 6,300 IP) and save me an additional 1,950 RP, leaving the total RP cost at 8,980 RP. With a bundle that comes down even more significantly.\n\nSlightly more on-topic, it's unlikely Riot wont do a bundle. Bundles are where Riot really makes money because, for a lot of people, it's something they wouldn't normally buy but because it's a bit cheaper they think \"oh, I could \"save\" money by buying the bundle\" even though they had no intentions to buy any of it in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"TacoZombie","date":"2015-08-22T00:59:17.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what if i had all the champs?
