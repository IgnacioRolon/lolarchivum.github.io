Mundo q cleaver is comparatively easy to land (and pretty cheap and spammable once you get a few tank items) compared to a thresh hook. Some abilities like Sivir Q, Soraka Q or Ashe W can barely be considered skillshots and some champions can just fire off their skillshot as a poke ability with very little concern since it has such a low cooldown and cost if they do miss, like Mundo, Soraka or Lulu's q (outside the lack of a slow for a few seconds and I guess the damage in a high pressure situation but odds are you'll hit with the speed of the ability and the size of the hitbox).\n\nIn terms of gameplay Soraka is much easier than Sona for instance despite having more skillshots. You also have to consider things like positioning and the risk of using an ability. I'd say that despite not having many proper skillshots, Riven is quite a difficult champion to play and should be avoided by beginners due to her high skillcap and her allin nature inspiring salty and detrimental mindsets. Whereas in my opinions (as a noob player myself who can't land skillshots), Cho'gath, Veigar or Ammumu are quite beginner friendly.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
