I play league 4-6 hours a day and potentially receive 1-4 honors for 80% of my games, yet somehow i&#039;m still honor level 3? It&#039;s extremely rare for me to bm or say anything rude at all. I don&#039;t troll or go against my teams attempts at objectives and so forth. I know that being reported can be a factor of declining honor level but like i said, its extremely rare for anyone to have a reason to report me.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-10-21T08:15:16.144+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My bug is that I got a notification telling me well done for achieving Honour Level 1 and to keep up the good work, her when I checked my profile, it still said Honour Level 0.","replies":[{"poster":"JustFahfah","date":"2017-10-22T09:40:18.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm although im technically not stating my issue is a bug, yours does sound like a good enough reason to send a bug report. I just think they haven't thought this system through with care at all. The thing that scares me is knowing even if you are a good player, with good game sense and were really supportive through the game, anyone from the opposite team could be salty/tilted af and just report you for no reason and drop your honor level.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-10-26T05:30:09.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JustFahfah,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=vpW6Gdzi,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-10-22T09:40:18.951+0000)\n>\n> The thing that scares me is knowing even if you are a good player, with good game sense and were really supportive through the game, anyone from the opposite team could be salty/tilted af and just report you for no reason and drop your honor level.\n\nI'm in the same situation as you... been honour level 3 for ages. I'm not toxic, however I do offer advice in game and sometimes when kids can't handle it they fly off the handle. I mute them, but I'm sure they report after the game. So this is probably why its not increasing.\n\nTLDR: play game, mute all, pingmute all, get honour level 5, if you wanna be a robot.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-10-25T08:41:17.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As per the Honor FAQ: \n> As you consistently play games and are awesome to your teammates, your Honor level will incrementally rise (even without getting honors). Being honored by your teammates slightly boosts the progression.\n\nAdditionally, you only drop honor in certain situations:\n> You’ll only drop if you receive a penalty. A chat restriction knocks your Honor level to 1, or 0 if you’re already at level 1. A two week suspension will drop your level to 0 (even if you were higher). In both cases, your honor progress will be locked, making your account ineligible for hextech crafting rewards. Your honor progress will unlock some time after your restriction as long as you show signs of reform.\n\nCheck out the Honor FAQ for more info!\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115008474148","replies":[{"poster":"JustFahfah","date":"2017-10-30T05:15:03.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm i can't see why its not going up then? ive never in my 8-9 months of playing ever recieved any penalty besides accidentally dodging the queue pop a couple of times?","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-10-31T12:34:29.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you feel like something weird is going on, I'd recommend sending a ticket to Riot Games Player Support, and they might be able to give you some context on why it feels like it's stagnating. \n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-10-22T23:19:14.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been honour 5 for ages, without even trying to be 'on best behaviour', so maybe you aren't giving enough honour yourself?\nIdk, just guessing.","replies":[{"poster":"JustFahfah","date":"2017-10-25T07:44:07.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well thats the thing, in the whole time ive played league with honor being around.
