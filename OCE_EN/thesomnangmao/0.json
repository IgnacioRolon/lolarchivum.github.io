Volibear gets attack speed upon reaching max stacks and for maintaining his stacks. Ashe does not.\r\n\r\nthe only thing i can come up with would be something like each stack provide her with a stat increase and upon activation this would double\r\nso for example. lets just say attack speed as a stat.\r\n\r\n20/30/40/50/60% Attack speed : active\r\n10/15/20/25/30%  Attack speed : Passive. the percent values shown would by divided by 5 (10% rank 1 = 2% per stack with 10% being max)\r\n\r\nthe interaction would be all focus stacks consumed and unable to stack focus for the duration of the active\r\n-\r\n\r\nanother feature could be something like lucians cooldown decrease as Ashe has some high cooldowns without very much upfront damage coming from her own abilities as its more about how they scale with the items she obtains later on in the game.\r\n\r\na comparison would be varus&#039;s abilities. although he is spec&#039;d in a different manner. his ratio&#039;s, quick burst (w and base numbers) and range/utility of his abilities simply seem to me.. outclass this ashe&#039;s skillset when it comes down to those specific factors (Cooldown, utility, damage)\r\n\r\ni&#039;m not saying &#039;make her at least varus level in terms of that&#039; i&#039;m just raising my concerns that i think the high Cooldown on Q not to mention the W damage ratio seem a little lack luster.\r\n\r\nback onto the Q active &#039;Consumes all Focus to grant 20/30/40/50/60% Attack Speed and increase Frost Shot&#039;s slow by 20% for 4 seconds&#039;\r\n\r\ni personally think the increase in effectiveness in the slow/New Passive/Frost shot should be moved into the W whereas hitting multiple arrows would increase the slow&#039;s power weather its duration or the strength of the slow itself.\r\n\r\nanyways that&#039;s i have on the matter. i think the rework is a great step to increasing the Ashe&#039;s value as a carry and look forward to this coming to live :D\r\n\r\ngreat job! &lt;3\r\n\r\nTheSomnangMao\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this post is off-topic could someone please redirect this to where it may be better served?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-01T08:31:35.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought that OCE didn't have a PBE?\n\nAnd in addition to that, how are you able to provide such detailed feedback when you apparently haven't even played the new Ashe yet? Everything's still on paper, if that's so, and it may turn out that it's a lot more fluid and interactive in action.\n\nJust saying.\n\nAnyway, this is off-topic for this board. To be honest, I'm not really sure *where* you'd put it here, as we have no boards for PBE content/feedback.
