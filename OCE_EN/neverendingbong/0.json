Now that I&#039;m in gold 4 I&#039;m actually finding things a bit harder to climb just because people are so scared! Scared to take objectives, scared of teamfights. Scared of everything. I want to get to plat, or possibly diamond, but I need a little backup.\n\n\n\n-Willing to improve and listen\n-Not critical, focuses more on own game play than worrying about others mistakes\n-Not toxic, if you&#039;re toxic to anyone, it will likely be the last game I play with you\n-Not scared to initiate teamfights and go all in with me\n-Good at peeling, keeping dive champions away from me\n-Good awareness in team fights\n-Map awareness\n-Wards objectives at the right times\n-Stays with me\n-generally overall smart person who is well mannered and lovely (No angry people please)\n-no laggy internet or crashy pc\n-plays fairly regularly, mostly every night and some days\n\nIf this sounds like you and you&#039;re looking for an adc who is good mechanically then hit me up, add me and we&#039;ll give it a go :)","replies":[{"poster":"Jannado","date":"2016-07-10T04:06:34.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey mate I'm keen to play with you IGN is Weaterarachelz I'm Gold 5 Play janna as my main sup and can keep divers off you for a good period of time Hit me up","replies":[]},{"poster":"Smoosey","date":"2016-07-08T03:24:12.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would be interested having a couple of games together.
