(As you already stated)\nThe bots are there to give you an instant response (And part a quirky but funny joke), once you click \" Request a Human\" your meant to type in another response, to update the ticket. So maybe just say hey whats up can i get a human? \n\nIn all honesty though, Riot will not Remove a restriction on your account unless its due to system error. And because security of your account is your responsibility it will not be removed (your restriction).\n\nHope I helped!\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} \n\nTherzair","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-03-05T09:38:33.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This isn't exactly true.

Sometimes this means they will see the 3rd party activity but miss the more hidden signs of compromise.\n\nA quick response to the ticket will push you up a tier, and you'll get a longer form response, which will most likely take you through the account recovery process. So long as there is no evidence of intentional account sharing on the account, they will usually return the account once ownership and account security are verified.","replies":[]}]}
