You can set up your own search lists in a Notepad or something, and copy them into league when you want this sort of feature, just split them all with a \"|\" and you will be able to list whatever you want (EG. For top, \"Illaoi|Gnar|Irelia|Renekton\")","replies":[{"poster":"IphStich","date":"2016-01-15T00:10:17.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, I didn't know about this.
