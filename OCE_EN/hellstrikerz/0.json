She's been untouched for years until recently.  Riot have been constantly nerfing her attack speed and now this is definitely going to be the final blow.  \n\n She got nerf in every stats we can think of from her abilities to her Base stats. Not to mention that to trade with your enemies you have to hug them to death. Not to mention match ups with the long ranged adc in the early game.  Tristana's gonna get stomped,  not being able to trade unless she all in.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-01-28T22:35:32.024+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think her new E brings in a lot of value in lane that may or may not make up for the nerfs. I'm not an expert player or anything but it feels like you can get really strong trades in lane.\n\ne.g. at level one Explosive Charge does 60 damage + 0.5bonus AD + 0.5 AP. Lets just say neither champs has items for simplicity. \n\nThats 60 damage that explodes after 4 seconds. **BUT** it also does a bonus 25% damage for every auto attack hit while the explosive charge is on the enemy! (max bonus 100% or double damage)\n\nThat means in lane, if you trade with E you are doing:\n\nAuto Attack damage + E base damage, now here is the interesting part because of the damage increase every auto attack.\n\nIf your opponent decides to try and trade with you while they have explosive charge on them, every time you hit them you are effectively doing 15 (60*0.25) extra damage to them! \n\nSo you can almost force them into losing a trade, as long as you have explosive charge up. \n\nA: you go to trade with explosive charge, they **dont** trade back, you get free damage!\nB: you go to trade with explosive charge, they **do** trade back, you get bonus damage!","replies":[{"poster":"HellStrikerZ","date":"2015-01-30T14:01:57.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did realise after playing her that her new ability makes up for the nerf and understand the extent of the nerf being required. \n\nThe new E has definitely mitigated  her mid game weakness\n\nThanks for sharing your insight though. \n\nI also did notice of the opponent being more afraid of the explosive charge than  they should be.  Eventually though, this fear is gonna fade away once people gets acquainted with the match up.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-01-29T03:32:03.106+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tristana is a late game hyper carry, not an early game bully, just like vayne, ffs stop %%%%%ing she's balanced now,","replies":[{"poster":"HellStrikerZ","date":"2015-01-30T14:11:56.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I meant is in the case that the nerf was significant to the point of having no chance to withstand the lanning phase then she'd be useless and wouldn't reach the hyper carry status. \n\nThe old tris was still able to trade early due to her burst damage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SeriouslyUnnamed","date":"2015-01-29T02:55:38.603+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"to be honest i think her new e out weighs all the nerfs {{champion:18}}  got.\n\nif all else it almost seems like a bit much. Imagine {{champion:18}} with {{champion:26}} support.\nBasically you got two time bombs, + a revive after {{champion:26}} reaches lvl 6 for more time bombs.\n\n60 Damage is a fair bit of poke damage in my opinion. and she would probably get a shot off as well. so that 75 + 0.5AD+0.5AP poke damage.\n\nnot to mention the damage you take from the passive on her e as you try to hide behind minions while you farm\n\nAdd this to her gap closure / escape which resets on any kill or Assist, \n\ngranted her early game isn't as strong as her late game, but its stronger than before IMO","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Obyssion","date":"2015-02-02T06:36:34.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her new bomb attack is definitely not to shabby and the fact that it can be applied to turrets now would make up for any missing attack speed as she was always very good at pushing. I wouldn't say she was nerfed I would say she was made more difficult so that would encourage players to learn how to use her and push themselves into the new abilities. Try to learn how to set the bomb on a target and then try to auto attack them as many times as you can, be in competition with yourself to try to get that bomb to go off and before you know you'll be annoying everyone with it!
