There just isn't enough data there for a single number to accurately represent anything. These kind of numbers only become something resembling accurate after 100+ games.\"\n\nAnd that's exactly my point. How on earth is that matchmaking remotely accurate? Btw saying that \"Trist is now gold\" is not a logical argument about the matchmaking at the time. At that moment in time who knows what their skill level was. The LEONA on the other hand has played a reasonable sample size to tank from their account starting mmr (which people say is in silver) and should be placed in lower category games. I have no problem with the blue team, just the completely randomness of the red team.\n\n**Picture 2 of your \"OCE Matchmaking 2\":** My point was that the Lee Sin's mmr at the time would have no bearing on why there is a an Iron 1 in the game. Like you say, they have the standard pre-placement silver mmr. But the Iron 1 should simply just not be in the game, considering that they had played a number of games to establish their level. You cannot compare the Iron 1 with the Vayne over the course of the rest of the season to logically argue that they should have been paired in this game.\n\n**Picture 3 of your \"OCE Matchmaking 2\":** I understand that Solo and Flex mmr are not the game. But in pairing players for their first Flex ranked games, why doesn't Riot take into account the soloqueue mmr, instead of starting them off fresh with a pre-placement silver mmr. It would certainly help to avoid these sorts of shellackings. Another thing that Riot could do is balance the TEAMS better using some soloqueue mmr weightings until players have established their Flex queue ranks over a specified number of games.\n\n**Picture 4 of your \"OCE Matchmaking 2\":** The Miss Fortune in this game has stopped playing Flex queue after completing their placements with a result of 4W 6L Iron 2 placement. By using the idea specified in the previous paragraph, Riot would get more accurate Flex Queue ranks and avoid some players simply giving up because their placements were lopsided.\n\n**Picture 5 of your \"OCE Matchmaking 2\":** Then information given was that this player (name withheld because I was afraid of the name/shame board rules police) was placed into my silver promo game. Considering that they were not a duo player, the questions are how and why? Consider the mmr, not the rank: mmr needs to be made simpler, like I said in my point 1. A 21% winrate player after 38 games is not even a high bronze level player, so you cannot even consider that argument that high bronze and low silver are not so far apart because in reality they are not high bronze level, unless of course mmr tanks very slowly. I would think that losing 22 out of your 30 games would tank mmr pretty quickly, but maybe this is not so. But it needs to be.\n\n**Picture 6 of your \"OCE Matchmaking 2\":** The cs numbers point was made to show the drop in skill level of players over the seasons and also because Riot invented the new Iron tier, this exaggerates it even more so. But 5 minutes into a game a Darius has 8 cs vs an Urgot, something does not seem right. Perhaps they are having a bad game, its true. I remember that when I first got placed into Bronze 3 at the start of season 5, back in the day when everyone had to play every role, players were getting between 5-7 cs per minute in the opening  15 minutes of the games consistently. The point is, resetting the ladder will make the cream rise to the top once again, and those players that are out of position will be put back much faster.\n\n**Picture 7 of your \"OCE Matchmaking 2\":** Perhaps the word 'caned' is not the correct term. Maybe \"jipped\", or \"ripped off\" would be better terms, considering that they have to face someone a whole tier above them, without any compensating factors on the teams. Silver 4 vs an established Gold 4 player at the time (over 600 games played with 49% winrate) is not fair matchmaking.\n\n**Picture 8 of your \"OCE Matchmaking 2\":** You wrote  \"Twitch did the worst in the game, is probably a second account yes, but if it is they are either intentionally losing (report) or are certainly not Master/Diamond. Also, 27 games is again, nothing. The Jhin had barely played any games (and still hasn't), and also outperformed this supposed Master tier Twitch so he must be doing something right. Bronze 1 rank also doesn't mean he has Bronze 1 MMR. With a WR like that he almost certainly doesn't.\"\n\nMy point here, is that 27 games with a 78% winrate should be enough to kick start the twitch's MMR into higher placements. Why are they being placed into a game with an mmr level around his own rank?? Jhin did not outperform the twitch by himself because the twitch was inting and running it down after some disagreements on strategy in game (check the build for example to confirm). I'm not interested in what happened in the game, only the matchmaking. According to the screenshot, the Jhin had a 42% winrate, was in Iron 1 at the time after 57 games. This would suggest to me that they are nowhere near high bronze, low silver mmr. \n\nConsider this situation. 10 players. Team A has MMR: Top 2500, Jungle 2200, Mid 2500, Bot 2500, Support 2800. Vs Team B with MMR: Top 2500, Jungle 2800, Mid 2500, Bot 2500, Support 2200. Using this example because it is from high elo, the game MASSIVELY favours Team B. Why? Because Jungle at this time has way more influence on the game in the early stages than support. This is an example of lopsided matchmaking. With the idea to give players the option to sit in queue for a little bit longer, this is can be greatly eradicated. I hope you see the point here. \n\nHOWEVER in the Twitch/Jhin game, these players ARE ON OPPOSITE TEAMS. Which makes the matchmaking STUPID to say the least.\n\n**Picture 9 of your \"OCE Matchmaking 2\":** The 24% winrate Yi situation I've already discussed in point 1 in previous post. But just to reiterate. A player that starts on a new account, that is not duo-queueing and has the standard silver mmr, but then only wins 24% of their games over a reasonable enough sample size (enough to change mmr) should not be placed in silver games.\n\n**Picture 10 of your \"OCE Matchmaking 2\":** I don't see how you can use **subsequent results** to justify the placing of players in games at a certain snapshot in time.  it doesn't wash with me. If the Vladimir has just finished placements and is coming out of a loss streak, why should I be placed in the same game when I'm a whole tier higher ranked? Again, by giving the matchmaking algorithim more time to find players (i.e. supports, which might have been harder to find at the time), this thing can be avoided.\n\n**The Last Picture of your \"OCE Matchmaking 2\":** (the high level game with Eyla). You are right here, the Qiyana wasn't gold last season. I was swayed by what someone said on the stream at the time, and didn't check it. But yes, they were autofilled and had a horrible game. At the higher ends of the spectrum there are many discrepancies that need to be fixed by resetting the ladder. For example at least 3 of the players in this game were no higher than Diamond 2 last season, and by maintaining a 50% winrate are somehow in games with the top 5 players on the server. This is a frustrating skill gap in these games, and its a major reason why pros are simply not playing many soloqueue games throughout the season, when they need their practice the most. (Some of them are playing now, to reach challenger at the end of the season). This happened because of the balls-up in matchmaking at the start of the season, combined with the introduction of the new tiers.\n\nOk, I hope you understand my points more now, and why I've selected the ideas to help remedy the situation at hand.\n\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-13T12:21:01.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Picture 1\n\nBecause there is a lot more that goes into MMR calculations than binary win/loss. The average MMR of an unranked account is mid-low Silver, and it is set there for a reason. Namely, that is the average skill (as far as I know a little lower under the same principle as the soft reset they do every year) of the player-base, and thus the most likely skill bracket they will fall into. It is essentially another compromise.\n\nWhere data is lacking you use *all* the data you have to make the best-educated guess you can and go from there. It isn't perfect, and this means  that mid-low Silver will always have a few outliers, but new players have to start *somewhere*, and this method results in the most accurate results possible.\n\nThe point of including some blue data was to point out there really wasn't a significant imbalance, because while red looked overall 'worse', when you really dig into it they were basically even.\n\nThe point of mentioning that Trist is now Gold was to point out that a winrate over 10 games is beyond meaningless and using it as the sole indicator is misleading *at best*. The Leona has still played &lt;30 so not much can be said.\n\n> Picture 2\n\nI mentioned the Lee Sin simply because they didn't have a visible rank and it was to put the whole into perspective. The Vel had and still has played barely any games. Not anywhere near enough for their visible rank to catch up to their hidden MMR. I mentioned their performance because their visible rank is Iron 1, but they are in a mid-Silver MMR range game and performed well, which would imply that their MMR is mid-Silver, and also likely climbing from there.\n\nThis comes down to MMR and visible rank not matching while people are climbing. MMR catches up to true skill much faster than visible rank does because it isn't impeded by divisions, placements, dodges, remakes, etc. \n\nTake my own climb as an example, in previous Gold-ranked seasons I would persistently be matched against Plat+, i.e I had a Plat~ range MMR, but I also never played enough games for my rank to catch up to my MMR. Now I have played those games and my visible rank has caught up to my MMR, and I've hit the plateau where I am no longer climbing ranks simply by playing.\n\n> Picture 3\n\nBecause Flex is a substantially different environment. Teamwork is a key skill when it comes to League, and the way that skill is executed differs wildly between Flex and Solo/Duo. In the same way that TT utilises all the same skills, but in different ways and to different depths as SR does, Flex vs Solo/Duo is much the same.\n\nPeople also treat Flex differently. For a player like myself, the ranks should be fairly similar because roles, champions and pre-mades are pretty consistent between the two, but for some players the difference is enormous. For example, a solo Mid main in S/D may play ADC with their Support mate in Flex, a role they don't normally play with a different lane dynamic because of the extra person, so relative skill and rank will differ greatly.\n\nSome people also don't take Flex as seriously and will play off-roles or champions, which puts their effective Flex rank lower because they have less skill with that given role/champ/playstyle.\n\nWhen dynamic queue was split back into Solo/Duo and Flex both queues used cues from the same MMR rankings. The reason they don't continue to do this for new Flex players is for the same reason they don't use normal MMR to indicate for new S/D players. The modes are different enough to cause more inaccuracy using that method than simply using the existing ranked player base to determine their MMR.\n\n> Picture 4\n\nThe accuracy of ranks is irrelevant to matchmaking health. Rank is purely an individual indicator of progression. So long as the hidden MMR is placing them in the appropriate games, which given they were in a premade and their solo rank reflects a similar skill level seems like it was, then matchmaking is essentially healthy because they are versing and playing with people of similar skill.\n\nPremades will always account for a degree of inaccuracy here.\n\n> Picture 5\n\n21% over 38 games tells you barely anything. When were the losses? (Were they early in placements before their MMR could catch up?) How did they perform in those losses? (Losing a game doesn't mean you personally lost the game for the team) Have they been getting filled/second pref roles? (Maybe they play a role that wasn't popular last season but is this one and so are being forced into their worse roles a lot) Do they play at weird times and so they are versing wider ranges of MMR resulting in odd visible results but perfectly accurate hidden metrics?\n\n38 games just isn't enough data to answer any of those questions which is precisely my point. Win-rate can only be used as any sort of accurate indicator past 100 games. Using win-rate or visible rank before that is only going to cause you grief by misleading yourself.\n\n> Picture 6\n\nThat 3-4/min number hasn't really changed all that much over the seasons in my experience, but also consider that the pace of the game has changed. First 15 minutes used to a lot more just farming up, where now there's a lot more fighting and trading. Naturally that impacts CS. The game has trended to a more aggressive and less passive pattern over time.\n\nThe introduction of Iron only exaggerates the perceived lowering of skill because it has pushed the ranks up. People are still in the same *relative* skill bracket that they were, but the true visible rank of that skill bracket has changed for many players. Gold remained about the same, but that means that anyone in Silver and Bronze essentially has their true rank dropped a div or two to compensate for the extra ranks. So Silver 4 of this season was the equivalent of Silver 2-3 last year at a conservative estimate.\n\nA full reset will result in exactly the phenomenon that you were criticising in Flex rank. You can't have both a full reset and take cues from past or other rankings. They directly contradict each other.\n\n> Picture 7\n\nTrying to base anything off of 3 minutes of a game and flat data is not a good way to come to a solid conclusion. You seem to be of the mindset that win-rate (regardless of games played) is the only factor in determining the outcome of a game. I highly doubt that is the case but it is the impression you give. We don't now know the exact circumstances of the Ryze nor the Yasuo. The system *has* all that background and in-depth data.\n\n> Picture 8\n\nNot necessarily, because again, which games is he winning/losing? Is he winning until the system puts him into Gold MMR games and then losing until he drops back into low Silver? Would that not indicate to the system that he belongs somewhere above where he is but below Gold? Well ok let's put him in mid-silver games and ramp it up slower this time until he starts losing again and then we'll even it out.\n\nHis match history would indicate that he *was* getting ramped real fast and that he was hitting the slow down point. Given that he's now Silver 3 with a substantially dropped 65% win-rate (and not a huge amount more games) it would seem to indicate that his true rank lies in the high Silver-low-Gold range, which is about right for the games that he was in with you (a mid Silver game).\n\nYou should be interested in what happened in that game because it's first-hand experience and can help guide the conclusions you draw from other insufficient data. The fact that the Jhin (who had an *apparently* low MMR) outperformed the Twitch (who had an *apparently* higher MMR) means that more than likely there is far more behind the scenes that is indicated in their win-rates and visible ranks.\n\nSomeone who's true rank is lower than Iron 1 (if we base it solely off his negative WR) is only going to outperform someone who is supposedly high Silver-low Gold (again basing it solely off of visible WR) under exceptional circumstances, and yet both their performances were consistent across the match and ross subsequent matches. Given that, clearly there is more to the story than what is shown in visible rank and WR, which is basically my entire running point.\n\n> Picture 9\n\nPerhaps they won the first 10 and got catapulted into low Gold MMR and the system is now dragging them back down to where they belong (and consequently dragging their early WR down too). There is simply not enough visible data to make those kind of conclusions.\n\n> Picture 10\n\nBecause MMR and visible rank does not match until a player plateaus (i.e reaches their true skill and MMR, ceases climbing and is just breaking even). *Subsequent* results give you a strong idea of where their MMR was trending before their visible rank had caught up. Given the Vlad's subsequent climb the system clearly knew he was meant to be higher than his visible rank indicated and got him there, giving you a good idea of why a visibly Bronze 4 player was in a mid SIlver game. *Because his MMR at the time was mid Silver and trending upwards*.\n\n> The Last Picture.\n\nThis comes down to population. Queue times in this MMR range are already excruciatingly long, and there just aren't enough people to get matchmaking of the quality that most people would like. \n\nThe system accounts for this by adjusting MMR and LP gains and losses based on whether you are \"expected\" by the metrics of the system to win or lose the match (Expected to lose and lose? Lose less LP/MMR. Expected to win but lose? Lose more MMR/LP. Expected to lose but win? Big gains.).\n\nThe alternative is that these players either have limited queue times, which has its own caveats of some players simply not being available at any of those times, or never getting a game at all. The current system is the compromise of wider matchmaking ranges to allow for games to actually exist, with adjusted gains to compensate for the imbalances that will inevitably occur.\n\nThere is no perfect solution, the scale simply makes that impossible.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2019-11-14T00:28:23.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Seras,\n\nI only started taking screenshots of these example, because I was sick of playing games where the one player in the game would cause everyone else to have less enjoyment. There were clearly players out of the skill depth for those games. And as a support main, I can fully understand where people like Exarch Leona are coming from. Because the support role is least popular, a lot of times the current system is placing the only supports it sees in the pool in with the monkeys. And that is frustrating to know that whatever your level is, a lot of time you will be lumped with monkeys.\n\nMy idea to revert champion select back to pick order where the player chooses their champion AND their role, I think is a good one. It will make much faster matchmaking (just like back in the day), hence giving the algorithim more time to choose the correct mmrs from the pool and not having to find ROLES from the pool. And the bonus is the playerbase skill level will rise, having to sometimes play roles that you currently don't mean that you learn each role. If you consider the autofill function at the moment, players hate that with a passion. But its really no different to what I'm proposing. Sometimes you will be last pick, and sometimes you won't.\n\nI think Riot's idea to have the current role selection was short term thinking that they could curb toxicity.\n\nAs for the matchmaking discussion, I don't have too much further to add, but I will address some points below.

In reality though, the system for flex should just have the same amount of premades on both teams, to save on calculations in that department. If I were in charge of everything though, I would simply delete flex queue and bring back team builder and the OOL.\n\n> The accuracy of ranks is irrelevant to matchmaking health. \n\nI agree, but the accuracy of MMR is.\n\n \n> Premades will always account for a degree of inaccuracy here.\n\nThat's right, but there are no premades in most of these examples, as stated. The Twitch/Jhin game is the most glaring. If you are saying that the ranked system gives more weight to a players first few games (i.e. placements) than the others, then it should be fixed.\n\nConsider this: A player starts a new level 30 account and tanks it into Iron 4, then tries to smurf on it (they are Master level). Perhaps this is what happened with the Twitch player, and why their MMR is still so low after their 78% winrate across a number of games. This is simply an outdated system, and needs to be tuned into what chess or DOTA2 does, which is to give equal weight (for MMR purposes) to each game and adjust after each game. And perhaps the Jhin is in the complete opposite direction for these calculations. This could be the only logical reason why those players are in the same game. But, its stupid and needs to be adjusted faster. Because the Jhin was clearly out of their depth, and they only performed better than the Twitch because Twitch was griefing.\n\nBy fixing this, there will be less incentive to troll like the Twitch and smurf from a new tanked account. Btw this Twitch's main account is called \"MMM Predator\" which they told me after the game. So not quite Master level as they were claiming, but still higher than the game in question. I'm guessing that because they were actually not as good as their D2 rank, they started smurfing to have fun. Because in game, they clearly lacked macro knowledge (we can talk about this in a whole new paragraph), and because they could not handle that a silver was calling them out when they disagreed with a call made, they started griefing and inting. By fixing the MMR system, you would also encourage less of this behaviour and make player reach their true ranks quicker. \n\n> There is no perfect solution, the scale simply makes that impossible.\n\nThat's right, but from where I'm standing Riot can do a lot more, which will help not only them, but the playerbase. Leaving an outdated system in place is in my view unacceptable.

But I will address points 1-4 and then move to the pictures later.\n\n1: The system does not do this satisfactory enough. Earlier in the season I was dodging many of these sort of players that have been placed into the wrong level of skill, but when you have to dodge more than once in a row, it is very time consuming. So by having a button that players themselves can choose or not to, is quite beneficial. Consider that not everyone has time to play league all day and only play 1-3 games at a time. I would rather wait an extra 10 minutes in queue for every game to be matched fairly, than to be waiting in a dodge queue for 1 game for 30 minutes.\n\n2: It's been tested. E.g. NEACE the streamer came back to play league after 1 year away. And even though he knew nothing about the new champs etc, he was placed into his old level of games (d1+). I gave an arbitrary number. Use whatever number is needed to stop player that have been out of the game for a long time, coming back and ruining the experience for others. They need to get to grips with the meta, etc etc. BTW Neace dodged the game after testing, because he knew he was not at the level at the time. This idea also will kill off a lot of account sharing, smurfing, selling, and boosting.\n\n3: You say it will tank the MMR real fast. But 30 games is not fast enough according that example given (the YI in the pictures). When you have 24% winratio, you are clearly out of your league, or trolling. Generally when its below 40% winrate after quite a number of games, you know that player is out of their league, or a griefer, wintrader etc.\n\n4: I understand that it would be \"painful\" for some players. But competitive integrity and skill matter more. I can understand why Riot will not do this, because they are afraid of losing their playerbase. But think about those players at the start of this season when the ladder wasn't reset. They were in the same position. A compromise would be to reset players to their season 8 mmr.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-13T10:18:58.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1: You will increase wait times even with an option, because even if only 10% of people choosing that option, the pool for players that don't is still smaller, and so the wait time longer.

This is will drastically reduce queue times, because searching for roles will be removed. It will also increase the overall skill of the playerbase, because players will learn every role and understand what the team needs best. It means that some players will need to learn support, but they always had to back then also. And then again, because players lock in their champions AND choose their role at the same time, they may not need to learn support if there is a support main locking before the last pick.\n\n> 2: I wouldn't be against something like this, the idea has merit, I just don't know how it would pan out in practice. Already visible rank has to catch up (or down) to hidden MMR when there is any period of change (climbing, reset, etc). This would create more times when MMR is not reflected by visible rank.\n\n> 3: MMR and visible rank are not always equivalent, there's more to it. The Yi most likely was playing in games *above* your MMR, and has now dropped into your MMR range. If he performed poorly in your bracket he will drop further.\n\nBut how could he have been playing in games above my mmr, which is say silver 3-4 ? With such extremely low winrates the system really needs to adjust better.\n\n> 4: Does true rank Golds with a visible rank and MMR of Diamond sound like good competitive integrity? The only way for a reset liek this to work as intended is to systematically match every player against every other individual player rather than being randomly matched into games (which is impossible).\n\nNo no, you misunderstand. The ranked reset resets the MMR also! Everyone would be at some predetermined mmr (it could be silver, could be gold, whatever is a good middleground) and we go from there.\n\n> The system wouldn't have any idea what rank a person should be, so when they win or lose a game it doesn't know what kind of gains to give them, and the whole thing goes out of whack. It's just big ol' dominoes.\n\nIt would operate exactly how it is doing now.\n\n> Why is season 8 MMR any more relevant than s9? By your own words you believe an MMR decay system would be a good idea, how is using 2-year-old ranked data better than using data from the previour year with a soft reset?\n\nSeason 8 mmr is more relevant because it was accurate for that time before the cockup in early season 9 matchmaking and the two new tiers were introduced. End of season 8 ranked data (1 year) would be less painful for those players that have worked for their mmr (and we are assuming that the balls up of dynamic queue matchmaking has been sorted out by this time).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2019-11-13T00:39:23.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot thinks their matchmaking is fine. I've had enough of poor matchmaking, it happens all too often. However there are the skeptics and forum nannies that try to despute these things so I've been gathering evidence over the past few months. Now it's time to show it.\nBefore you consider the pictures, note that for all Ranked \"Soloqueue\" games displayed, they were checked for players in duo, and there were none.\n\nSo for those who actually care about the issue, [here is the evidence.](https://imgur.com/a/r8shadT)\n\nNow, for some solutions, they would be quite easy.\n\n1. Wait longer to pair players of equal strength. Even have an option for players to say \"wait longer for me\" or they can keep it the same as it is now, if they are happy with it.\n\n2. Make MMR decay after 6 months for all players.\n\n3. Don't make the pairing algorithm complicated. If you see a 24% winrate player over more than 30 games, they are not at their normal mmr. Adjust accordingly.\n\n4. Reset the ladder fully at the start of season 10. This will clear out the monkeys and make a level playing field again. Its frustrating to see pro players having to cope with idiots time and time again. The cream will rise to the top eventually, just do it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-13T08:56:49.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll preface this by saying I know full well you aren't going to like what I have to say, and will more than likely vehemently disagree, but I would like to encourage discussion on the topic.\n\nI'll go through your solutions first.\n___\n.1. \nThe system essentially already does this, it's why queue times are a thing at all instead of just matching us with/against the first people who's roles match.\n\nYou also have to consider that people aren't machines, and their performance will differ based on a million different variables like the amount of sleep they've had, how long they've been up, general awareness, hundreds of other biochemical factors, etc.\n\nAt that point, the specific timing comes down to compromise. If you were to wait for the perfect match, you'd literally be waiting forever. How long is too long for people to wait? That's rather subjective, but getting people into *a* game that has slightly worse matchmaking is better than them literally never being able to play at all. \n\nAlso consider that this phenomenon is accounted for in LP gains/losses. If you lose against a team with higher MMR than you, then you will lose less LP and visa versa. (Bearing in mind that this isn't the only factor that goes into LP calculations)\n___\n.2. \nNot a bad idea, we don't necessarily know that it doesn't though, and even if it doesn't, the soft reset at new season start effectively has the same effect. There is an argument for making it sooner, but it may cause more harm than good for such a thing to happen in the middle of the season.\n___\n.3. \nAgain, it already does this, loss streaks (or near streaks) will tank your MMR real fast. That said, 30 games really isn't a lot to be basing any sort of concrete conclusions off of.\n___\n.4.\nIn theory, it sounds great. Except consider the unlucky player who's true rank is Plat~ but who has been versing mostly true ranked Diamond+ and has now tanked from the placement rank of mid silver down into low Bronze. Consider the opposite as well. If the average rank is Silver, then many in true Gold+ are going to be catapulted past their true rank just by virtue of population dynamics, and then will have to face the demoralising loss streak to drop back to where they belong.\n\nThings will settle eventually, but it would probably take more than a year, and it would be a *very* painful experience for all involved in the mean-time.\n___\nAs for your images, I'll address those in images because this is getting long.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/W8YSUuj","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Min na o miru me","date":"2019-11-12T07:03:55.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dinga dinga dinga ding","replies":[]}]}
