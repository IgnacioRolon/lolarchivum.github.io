However it is rarely stable as for whatever reason my ping likes to spike up to 500 (especially when im in my ranked games) for no reason, and this happens randomly throughout the day. During the day when I&#039;m home alone and no one else is on the net, 700 ping. At 2am when everyone&#039;s gone to bed it&#039;s hanging out at 800 ping. If im in the middle of the game as a quick fix I usually switch over to my phone hotspot, and that fixes the problem maybe 3/5 times...lately though, my ping keeps spiking at smaller but really frustrating intervals for no reason. it would jump from 40 to 200 and back again every 2 seconds, so it keeps lagging periodically throughout the entire game - the most frustrating part is that it sits at 40 in the loading screen, and jumps as soon as i get into a game. How do i fix this?? this every-2-second ping spike is happening even when im using a hotspot (i ve tried using different phones with different service providers and the 40 - 200 ping jump keeps happening).my speed test says my ping is 25 ms :/","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2017-11-14T00:32:25.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi\n\nInternet connection problems suck, and it can be really hard to know what to do when they are happening.\n\nOne question initially - do you play over WiFi or with an ethernet cable to your router?  Wifi is often the source of a lot of connection-related pain.\n\nThere's a new site that we've just launched which might help - [lagreport.com](https://lagreport.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/steps).  It helps you look at your internet connection (from the perspective of League) and also gives a LOT of information and steps on how to troubleshoot it.   If you haven't checked it out I'd strongly suggest you do!\n\nCheers!\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"firelord mel","date":"2017-11-27T10:19:29.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play on wifi, butI'll give the cable a go!
