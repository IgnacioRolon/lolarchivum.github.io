The higher I go, the more butt hurt and toxic the players are. I am currently in high silver/low gold and I played against a feeding Master Yi that went 0/22 and the our Fizz constantly kept killing him. We almost lost that game because the Fizz would be really stubborn and selfish that he never grouped and kept chasing the Yi where ever he was. I also encountered a people that acted like gods because there higher then gold. Yes your gold but your not god. Also Ive seen tons unranked players with almost no experience at all in my games. I&#039;ve been trying too reach gold but in my position I cannot do that. Any tips from any high elo players?","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-12-24T14:09:45.426+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just keep playing thats what I did.\nPeople do stupid shit all the time, its gonna happen.\n\nIts ok to get angry, I get fuckign furious with some people.\nBut as long as you never type the bad shit and mute the really bad assholes.\n\nYou should be all ok.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-12-24T10:12:26.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What type of play style are you? I myself am gun ho and charge in like an idiot with the mentality that if I get a kill or 2, at least I am doing something and sacrificing myself for my team HOPING that they have a brain, that is the WRONG idea, I should not be relying on my team.\n\nBut than I don't really play ranked and don't really care for the win or the lose, I play to have fun, make an effort and try to just make every game enjoyable regardless of anything.\n\nIf you want to climb higher you need to not have my attitude and instead focus on staying alive, being dead, regardless of anything, is a bad idea. A kill for a kill mentality gets you nowhere.\n\nMy best tip for you, don't focus on the kills either, that is not the only way to win your lane, all you need to do is force the enemy out of the lane by pushing them around enough so they cannot farm. Even if they stay in the lane at low health and still gain the EXP, it is pointless if they are not gaining the gold, they are staying in the lane for nothing. If they B, than you get free farm or a chance to B yourself without losing any ground in lane.\n\nOn the flip side, if you are being pushed, what do you do, do you play ultra safe and farm only under your tower? Keep trying to farm as normal (the riskiest play) and hope you don't die before the enemy goes B so you can B? Or do you B just before the next wave comes so you only lose minimal gold and exp?\n\nYou need to think about staying alive more than anything so you don't lose any ground on the enemy, even if that means sacrificing some farm in lane so you can stay in lane longer. Work out the maths, time taken dead and getting back to lane, time taken to B and get back to lane, or time sitting in lane sacrificing some farm? The third option I think is the best, you stay in lane, you still get the exp, you get a chance to get more gold and even possibly a kill if you are good enough without dying. Plus, you are defending your lane and stopping them from getting your tower and roaming.","replies":[{"poster":"jonny11d","date":"2016-01-02T15:27:15.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Even if they stay in the lane at low health and still gain the EXP, it is pointless if they are not gaining the gold.......\n\n...........The third option I think is the best, you stay in lane, you still get the exp\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"XSirCution","date":"2015-12-25T07:23:53.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning-Kruger_effect\n\nThis buddy\n\nOnce you accept this, you will start to climb\n\nYou need to practice, that's all there is to it tbh","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-12-24T02:10:26.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just ignore how bad other players are doing and focus on yourself. i can see your most recent ranked games you have about 7-10 deaths for a few of them.

Focus on ourselves, ignore teammates and dying as least as possible. But all of those should under the condition of you are good enough. I am play. I played some silver games using my friends' acc. In most case, I can easily 1 v 2 at bot. Destroy turret asap and then get drag or push other lanes' turrets because you have to expand your own advantages to the whole team. Dragon and turret benefit the team. \n\nTips: muted whole team at beginning ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-12-24T09:36:49.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Number 1 tip: Dont get hung up on the games that aren't winnable. If you have some guy go 0-10 in lane, or someone troll or afk because they didn't get the role they want, that's not a game you should be worried about losing, because you win just as many from an enemy doing the same thing.\nFocus on making the difference in the close games, where your play is what tips the scales and decides the outcome. These are the games where a better player would win but you might lose.","replies":[]}]}
