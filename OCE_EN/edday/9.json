If you like top laners who do really good poke, is a little tanky and can 1v1 easily, Jayce is your guy. He recently got a buff though; now you don't need to put points into your ult! This means that you can upgrade your abilities five times instead of four, which in the end, is more damage then it use to be. However, because of this change, it makes his earlier Lvls a bit weaker. It's up to you! No, he won't get a buff, but he will still remain the same, and will be just as fun! Who knows, maybe some of the new ADC items will work really well with him? \n\nThanks","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gravelord","date":"2015-11-09T09:38:10.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well right now he is amazing to play, I don't think he will change too much in the near future. The new season seems to be all about damage carries, i usually play Jayce as a bruiser :)","replies":[{"poster":"Edday","date":"2015-11-09T09:55:23.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"do you think the new season changes are a nerf or buff?","replies":[{"poster":"Gravelord","date":"2015-11-10T12:23:04.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldnt know man, Its a change, not so much a nerf or buff","replies":[]}]}]}]}
