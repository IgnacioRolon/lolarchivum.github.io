If everyone is experiencing it than Rito will have something to say, but if there is no widespread reports than it is just you and you can basically suffer.\n\nAnything over 250 ping is unplayable in online games, even at around 200 whilst you can play, it gets increasingly frustrating that on your screen things work different to the server and makes it not fun, at 500 I am surprised you even bother, you will always be around half a second slower.\n\nFirstly I would be sticking to bots, at least that way you are still guaranteed a win and will not disadvantage anyone.\n\nSecondly I would be looking at trouble shooting everything, turn of ALL other programs that use bandwidth, and I mean all of them. Simply go into your Task Manager and end every task there is that uses the internet.\n\nNext you will want to go into your router settings and setup QoL, force everyone else but you own rig to have no access, now try again. If it still pings high, you have problems, if not, you turn everything back on one at a time and test your own custom games with nothing but you and maybe a bot, this will allow you to quit instantly without penalty, turn some more programs back on and try again.\n\nI would be turning off all your programs and other computers and seeing what happens, if you get high ping than at least you know it is one of the other computers on the network. If you don't get high ping, it would most likely point to something on your own computer that is making the lag high.","replies":[]}]}
