He was first pick and typed &quot;Jung&quot; and instalocked Lee. As we were all locked in he took ignite instead of smite and started dorans while also starting gromp but then soon died too red buff. We had a top Teemo and I was Ekko mid, I was up against a Yasuo and did fairly decent. Soon it went too late game and we managed too take all 3 towers down and then Lee started to try to backdoor EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. He always died and never managed to get even one. We asked him too group but still did&#039;nt say anything after the enemy team pushed and won. He had a plat border and he said he purchased the account for $200!\r\n\r\nI feel like Riot should do something about this.","replies":[{"poster":"MrMunstr","date":"2015-11-12T09:12:40.395+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You should have reported at the end of the game, as buying accounts it illegal. You can't expect riot to do anything if you're not reporting the problems via the in-game system. \nI've been matched with some bad players, same as your describe - though I don't see why anyone would purchase a Silver account {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-11-12T10:52:28.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He overpayed for that account, gf him.","replies":[]}]}
