Get tanky, dive towers, kill minions and draw people to you whilst your team takes cross map advantages. Its difficult to do if your team isnt on the same page as you. I myself am a top lane main, and the \"most played\" Rumble main in OCE. I find Rumble, Hecarim, Maokai, Irelia, Gnar, Vladimer, Ad Bruiser Fizz, Even Tahm kench in some situations are all viable picks. Most (apart from rumble, should be built tanky, and thus even if you only have single target damage, can still provide a decent amount of peel and protection for your carries in team fights. Fizz and rumble are quite similar in playstyle, hit a power spike, get in the oppositions face. Vlad and gnar are also similar, poke a bit, keep sustaining, then all in when you have an edge.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-08-11T11:45:33.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i play {{champion:86}} \n\nso simple yet so effective\nsample video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0nFDHILtqk","replies":[]},{"poster":"Edday","date":"2015-08-11T10:28:12.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After reading some replies and other threads, iv'e decided to go with Gnar.

It's good to learn him if you're around SIlver. Other than that, Yorick has lots of potential but he can be easily countered if you know his abilities well. Yorick is so rare that most players that are around Silver won't know his potential.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-08-10T23:19:23.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like nasus and cho\nThey can carry even if team feeds:\nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/85509809/200847413?tab=overview <----- Nasus\nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/90852770/200847413?tab=overview <----- Cho'gath","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-08-10T23:13:59.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Irelia, Riven, Wukong, Malphite and Shen are the best top laners at the moment IMO.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AcerArena13","date":"2015-08-10T22:08:36.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My personal favourites are currently {{champion:5}}  and {{champion:31}}.\n\n{{champion:31}} has really good poke with his q and w (and e if you use it properly), and he becomes extremely tanky later on in the game.\n\n{{champion:5}} has an extremely good all in at level 3, and if you kill your opponent, it means that you will most likely win lane, which will translate into tp plays, roams to mid lane, and often, winning the game.\n\nHope this helped","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shes my Princess","date":"2015-08-10T16:41:54.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man. Plat 3 top lane main here. Honestly for starters, you should just pick 3-4 _differently styled_ champions to work with and aim to get as good as you possibly can be with them.  When I say differently styled champions, I mean ones that aren't all the same both mechanic and counter-wise. \n\n**What you want is versatility on a relatively small scale with champions you're reasonably comfortable with** when playing, especially in draft mode such as ranked. \n\nFor instance, there's no use learning vladimir, swain, elise and ryze as your only comfort picks, as they're all similar in the fact that they're ability power poke styled champions. Versatility is the key to success in most cases. So when you can see that the other team has locked in a teleport top lane fizz with ignite, instead of being forced to play a sustain, poke champions like the ones above (especially in the current morellonomicon meta), you're free to go with another practiced comfort pick that at least goes even matchup-wise.\n\nMy personal comfort picks while learning tops were rumble, singed, vladimir and renekton. It's honestly up to you, but I reccommend learning a few different champions with their mechanics in order to never be in an extremely unfavourable position before the game's even begun.\n\nHope this has helped.","replies":[{"poster":"Shes my Princess","date":"2015-08-10T18:22:09.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Obviously you won't see the teleport/ignite, but it's a hypothetical situation in which you're garaunteed their fizz is top.\n\nAlso, try not to stroke the meta's D*** too much, solo queue isn't lcs.

His passive is a very minute buff for 1v1s but not really a strong point. He has quite a number of strong counters in the top lane available to be picked against him, which makes laning phase typically harder for you than it is for you enemy laner.\nThose being:\n{{champion:24}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:31}} \n{{champion:59}} {{champion:120}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:98}} \n{{champion:102}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:48}} \n{{champion:80}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:126}} \n\nThese are most who give you a lot of trouble lane phase. Once lane phase ends and you've got a couple of items you can survive and even destroy those in this line-up (who aren't tanks). Wukong isn't considered as freelo as Riven either because he has no sustain, he doesn't have tanky base stats (with high base damage to compensate i.e. Renekton) he has his gimicky, though effective decoy for defense and he has no CC other than his ultimate unlike many other top laner who do have CC besides their ultimate. If you camp him, he's not going to be very useful at all for the majority of the match, not until very late game where everyone already is at full build anyway. \n\nYou can build him with tons of Armor Pen and AD (glass cannon-ish), imho the best way, not easy for the lane phase.\nOr\nYou can build him tank, which he does a very disruptive job of when you max 40% CDR and have your ultimate up every teamfight in the lategame. Your clone is pretty much your team's damage soaker half the time, hilarious.\n____\nRegardless, Wukong is fun every time if you like challenges, that *don't* 100% stomp you. Examples that do is playing against a plat smurf riven or a darius who's actually competent or pantheon.
