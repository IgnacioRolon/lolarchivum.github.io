I admit i have left the game in the past and got a 20 minute leave buster but recently I was hit by another 20 minute leave buster from my laptop overheating and being absolutely unable to connect to the internet. I feel like the leave buster system should reset after finishing a 20 queue. Every time i get a new leave buster, it starts at 20 minutes again. So please Riot, a deduction on these timers would be really nice. All though I am very open to read points against my current argument.","replies":[{"poster":"Yougondienow","date":"2015-08-21T10:10:41.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I'm gonna agree with you, due to me getting the 20 minute leavebuster too. Riot OCE , PLEASE can't you make this system a little more efficient?? I feel like I've been slamdunked for reasons - months old - that most likely were leaves out of absolute nicesity <-- hate this word. I do have a child and sometimes he still wakes up at midnight but i dont do this frequently enough to deserve 5 games of this!! I play alot, cant you balance the system somehow, bearing in mind that some of us actually love yer game? </3 \n\nI'd love if someone could get a hold of me in-game to chat about this for my circumstances\n\nThanks kindly :(","replies":[]}]}
