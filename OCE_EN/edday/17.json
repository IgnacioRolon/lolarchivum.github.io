This morning I&#039;ve let my computer update League for about an hour and   it only went up too 32%. So I waited and waited for about 2-3 more hours and it STILL was on 32%. Is anyone else facing these problems? Is this a problem with my computer or am I just not being patient enough? Considering how small the update is, it shouldn&#039;t take more than thirty minutes. Also my disk storage goes all the way too 100% and my computer becomes VERY slow when I try too update. Also on a side note, I have NEVER had a problem with updating League for as long as I could remember. I&#039;d like someone too help me solve this very irritating issue.","replies":[]}
