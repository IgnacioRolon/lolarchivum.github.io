Though, the player with bad internet would have to leave the game for the 90 second requirement, the game would need to have reached the 3-minute mark and there would have to have been no first blood. Basically, your team would need to work together to make it happen, because I doubt your opponents would allow your team to not die to force a remake (pretty much everyone wants that 5v4 advantage).","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-06-22T08:48:23.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"someone has to be dc'd (left the game) for 90 seconds before the 3 minute mark","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2016-06-22T07:19:58.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"only if they have left the game at the 3 min mark","replies":[]}]}
