It's ok to be able to smite more often and steal bonus gold and get 175% ms but the MS is sort of useless. If you have 2 free Jungles even then it's still not that great and if you are way ahead and can invade heaps even then the other upgrades are usually better. (I believe Riot said they were thinking about removing/reworking poachers and said it is in a bad place right now but that they'd most likely remove it seeing as only like nunu goes it).\n\nNunu is ok with it mainly because of the bonuses he gets from smiting monsters so he can basically have that bonus up at all times plus he is tankyish/sustainedish so it can be really good for him synergy wise because he gets other bonuses other than the normal smite bonuses - when he consumes a big jungle minion.","replies":[]}]}
