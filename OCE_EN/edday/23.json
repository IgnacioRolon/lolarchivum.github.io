The enemy team killed me once and they started to say  &#039;ez&#039; and all of that, so I decided to start flaming in a joking way along with my friends. We ended up winning and I got off the game. Like an hour later when my friends wanted to play again, so I popped back onto my smurf, and boom. 14 day ban.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not complaining or anything, just suprised. Good job Riot.\r\n\r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-05-16T01:40:27.500+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a common misconception that Riot's punishment systems have major flaws. They do have flaws, but it's (mostly) minor (and that exists with any system, manual *or* automated). One of the issues with the way Riot's punishment systems work is that there's little feedback to the community so that people know it's working, and as it should be. The Instant Feedback System was implemented to help with that, but it has yet to reach it's full potential. As it stands, usually the only person to receive the notification that someone they reported was banned is the person who submitted the most recent report when the punishment was applied. Riot planned to spread it around a bit more, however there hasn't been any news on that (at least not that I've seen).\n\nOne of the other things to consider is that people will generally focus on the negatives and ignore the positives. This means that, when they complain about the negative aspects, they're misrepresenting the whole picture, which they believe to be mostly/all negative when it's likely a lot more \"balanced\" (around 50-50) or skewed towards positive.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that each person has a different experience in-game. Some people have more negative experiences, and those are the people who are most likely to speak up, while others will have more positive, or even neutral, experiences, and those people don't really have reason to speak up. For example, I see a lot of people consistently complaining of troublesome players on the boards, yet, personally, I rarely have any such problems, and they're usually pretty benign. To put it simply, the people I see complaining have more negative experiences while I have more neutral/positive experiences (at least when it comes to the behaviour of other players).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-05-15T23:25:58.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Straight to a 14 day ban?
