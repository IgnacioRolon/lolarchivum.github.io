We just ignored it and proceeded into the game where I was up against a diamond Lee Sin. It was about 20 minutes in when we were doing dragon and I lost the smite war. Ahri after 20 minutes said something. &quot;wow rengar ur shit at smiting&quot; I kinda just told her I wasn&#039;t the best at smite wars and just continued on. It was heading into late game were my friend was getting harassed by Ahri telling him his bad etc. We kinda told her she was being negative and she should stop but, she doesn&#039;t. She keeps telling us that were to &quot;dumb&quot; to realise we were terrible at the game even though we kinda already knew. Soon after, I got enough and just started pressing keys and just went full tryhard mode. She than proceeded to LIE and say &quot;when did that happen?&quot; We kinda just ignored it for the rest of the game where she was accused US for abusing HER. She than goes on about how we were being &quot;pedophiles&quot; and calling her dumb. I told everyone in the post game chat lobby that she was straight up lying and she left immediately. Our entire team reported her for negative abuse and I believe some of the enemy team did as well.\r\n\r\nThis was one of the worst games I&#039;ve had in League.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-20T12:16:47.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am very sorry you had this experience. I've faced this sort of behaviour before myself and I definitely understand how incredibly infuriating it is. Reporting is your best option, so thank you so much for doing that. \n\nThe only other thing I can recommend to you is to mute as soon as someone demonstrates toxicity, especially on this level. I have trouble muting, because my curiosity gets the better of me, but I find when I do mute and keep them muted that it is ALWAYS a much better experience for me. \n\nThank you again for reporting her, I cannot stress how important reporting actually is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-02-20T11:51:25.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ye, happens to everyone. Good thing you did the sensible move of reporting her and moving on. \nNext time have a 5man premade team ;)","replies":[]}]}
