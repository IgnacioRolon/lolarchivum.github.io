Why you may ask? I want you to nerf him so he can actually be played in ranked. Im getting quite frustrate how I never get to play my main and Im losing quite a bit of lp.\r\n\r\nThanks Rito Gems\r\nSincerly Edday.","replies":[{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-04-17T06:55:32.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I ban zed because:\n\n1. Zed players are pricks\n2. Zed players are awful, so it's like banning Aurelion Sol on the day of his release so plebs won't be able to mess up on him.\n3. Zed is annoying to deal with, I don't even play midlane, but I don't want to see that scum in my game.\n\nGet a new main. Honestly, it's better for you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-04-17T02:27:06.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish they'd only nerf what is strong at LCS level.

Champions that require high amounts of mechanical skill to pull of can be quite risky to let through, as there is a chance someone on your team will pick them and end up going full potato (everyone in silver/bronze seems to \"main\" the hard champions).\n\nA good idea is to expand your champion pool to encompass a wider range of champions, not just what is considered OP. I see that your champion pool consists mainly of high priority picks/bans which can make it a little difficult sometimes. Picking more champions for your roles will allow you to have a a bit more room for fitting into your team comp (like, if your entire team was AD, you wouldn't want to pick Zed), and one of your mains will get through banning phase safely.","replies":[]}]}
