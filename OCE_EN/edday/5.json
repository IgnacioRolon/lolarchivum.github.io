Take a gtx 950 for 150$ for exemple, it is worlds apart from that gt 720 and can enable you to play any current game. If your computer was pre built make sure your power supply is strong enough for your future card and that you won't want to change every piece of component in your computer 1 at a time after your gpu upgrade. Wait sales/ buy used/ compare. To compare you can do something as simple as write gt 720 league of legends on youtube, saw a guy with gt 720 run very high 70 fps. If you think you might be interested in more than just league you might want to consider a bigger/more thought investment as it would have a much better value for your money. Check your power supply!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akivir","date":"2016-04-06T11:23:41.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly if you get that card you are wasting your money.

I'd consider the 9800 GT a good benchmark for league, my friend gets about 60fps on max settings.\n\nPlay around with different cards until you get a super duper one that works. I'm using a HD 7790 1GB which is overkill for league. Most desktop cards of 1GB GDDR5 kill it. Even older GTX 460's are overkill for league.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2016-04-06T10:42:10.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you'd get 60 stable on very low, low, and medium, and you might get 60 stable on high.","replies":[]}]}
