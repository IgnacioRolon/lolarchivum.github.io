Its a made up name that they go by on a video game and who cares and if someone posts their name on a forum that&#039;s a good thing. It means that that person can get banned like they deserve. Currently if someone leaves a game or is incredibly toxic they wont hesitate to continue because nothing will happen and if you keep banning people like this you get flagged as &quot;a constant reporter&quot; and your reports are outright ignored. Please RIOT, make this game worth playing because at the moment OCE is just a place people go to abuse and troll other people and maybe play a proper game if they feel like it.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-28T08:12:01.178+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hint: the reason name and shame isn't allowed is because witch hunts happen and the person might not be guilty of anything even though there is a witch hunt for him/her.\n\nAlso who cares if we get told if people get banned?\n\nWhy should you get told?","replies":[{"poster":"The Ghost","date":"2015-03-28T10:36:57.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is all this talk of a witch hunt. How could anyone get bullied on League unless they add them as a friend in which case they just delete them. You dont know who they are in real life. Im not endorsing it im just saying its not even remotely a valid point. \n\nThe idea of knowing who if someone gets banned is so that you at least know that something is being done. The most common phrase is \"report me nothing is going to happen\" and the fact that its true is pretty sad to be honest.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-28T11:12:34.750+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What has happened in the past, is higher elo players (Plat+) have been accused of Scripting (using scripts to dodge/always hit skill shots) now when sent to riot, they personally decide whether this is the case or not, and go about it there way, but the thing is mentioning this on the forums used to elicit people asking riot to ban them and harassing said player, guilty or innocent as the case may be.\n\nAs for your second point, it's not true, people do get banned, daily, i believe rito released statistics on this a while back, but i'm not sure where they would sit, but people getting reported does result in bans/chat restrictions, fact is the people who report them don't need to know what happens, justifying it by saying \"this is proof it works\" is horse shit, you should know it works, and if it doesn't ban them immediately (which you seem to assume) it will bite them in the ass eventually as reports build up.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Todgins","date":"2015-03-28T01:18:14.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am for the report outcome, if you've been force to play with a summoner who spends more time abusing me than playing, a simple \"we have taken action\"  would be greatly appreicated.\n\nAs for the name and shame on forums, I'm a no on this one. It's too easy for me to get 3 friends and say that \"Player X\" abused me for 50 minutes, went afk 7 times and kept calling me a potato. -- Then everyone that see's the guy automatically assumes that he is an ass without giving him a chance.","replies":[{"poster":"RiseOfTheCookie","date":"2015-03-28T05:04:24.745+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Anyone can make stuff up, no one believes it unless it's a screenshot.
