The action is completed when the bubble is out and it cannot be stopped by silencing or suppressing Nami, but it doesn't apply it's cc until the bubble lands. Most skills have these windows between activation and effect, and if you suppress them in it, the effect is still gonna go. \n\nYour whole issue is that you caught Garen mid Q and not before because it had already activated. As for Trist, Garen's Q still goes off and goes on CD, but because he was pushed out of it's range it doesn't affect her, it's a very different scenario from a suppression.\n\nSo yes..it is working as intended. The thing about the Malz suppression is that unlike most other cc abilities, it doesn't have delay window, it's instantaneous, which means beyond predicting when you are likely to use it (is your behaviour and playstyle), it is unpredictable, so champs like Garen are going to be trying to get that silence on you, carries like Trist are gonna be trying to get you away from them. It means they don't have that later, and you should be working on capitalising on that window they are forced to give you because of the unpredictable nature of the skill, not complaining about the times you messed it up.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-30T06:46:06.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"unless that garen presses s or tries to move mid that q","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-30T08:18:28.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well yeah but that's him cancelling it not the Malz ult.

Most if not all soft CC won't really stop anyone, just slow them down and when they are in range, too bad.\n\nHard CC stops a lot, if not everything, but it still doesn't answer why Malz ult is possibly the only one that is hard CC that takes forever to go off and is one of the most easily coutnered ults in the game due to how it is executed.\n\nI personally still think that once you press your ult and you are in range, it should immediately stop whoever it hits unless A DIFFERENT SHOT cancels your ult or something that is mid air. Garen using his Q, bad luck, he can go jump and get ready to swing, it should immediately stop him where he is, there is nothing written into Malz ult that states anything along the lines of not stopping them dead in their tracks, it says \"Malzahar **knocks down**\", which means:\n\nKnockdown\nThe target is made airborne for a single instant.\nInterrupts the channeling of abilities.\nInterrupts dash abilities.\nThe effect cannot be either reduced or cleansed, as the effect is instantaneous.\nChampions with Knockdown: Veigar, Viktor, Malzahar.\n\nSo how come and instantaneous ability can be stopped by the very definition that Riot have given? Pretty much anyone with any hard CC and some soft CC can prepare for Malz and use it at the right time to make his ult useless, even when Riot are stating otherwise.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-01T05:58:39.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea, you got outplayed, stop complaining and stop crying, its like when a garen aa you with q after you flash a wall, it happens get over it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-30T13:54:14.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> It cancels all actions but if an action has already been executed, like if Garen had already lifted his sword up for his Q, then it's a past action and it won't be stopped.\n\nIf the skill in question is past activation stage then the suppression won't stop it. Read my post above. If the skill has already activated (left the character essentially, Garen's Q is just after his sword hits the peak of it's swing) then it'll still go off because the character is no longer in control of it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-11-30T09:51:39.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually Warwick ult IS disrupted by those, if your quick and know it's coming you can stop it fairly easily as anything with a targeted stun.\n\nNot to mention, you trying to suppress from melee range, and then bitching that Warwick suppress isn't stopped shows you understand more so how to use a WW ult then a malz ult (no suppress should be used in melee range, that's asking for it to be canceled.)\n\nI have stopped point blank WW ult's with Thresh E's because he was in melee range several times, as the person who was being ulted (and ranged ones, but melee is the point we are going for in this post)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
