Regardless of why you had a bad game, you could have just been playing bad, no chance to gank, counter picked, whatever.\r\n\r\nBut because you had a bad game, all those other games you played were just luck and should not have happened?\r\n\r\nThe attitude of this community is fucking retarded. You get no thanks for having a good game and carrying your team, but you get reported for having a bad game, your fault or not.\r\n\r\nDo you lot really get off on being negative at everything? Do your lives suck that bad that you have to come here and vent at everyone? What is the deal, can&#039;t you just try and be nice?","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-09-24T08:24:49.967+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same reason we look at the adc when he gets a penta and not the support who carried that bitches ass since it was just a wee noob adc.
