And they all say the same that nothing will happen because the reports don&#039;t work.\r\n\r\nThat only tells me they are assholes in most of their games as they continue to get away with it, there can be no other reason that they are so sure the reports don&#039;t work.","replies":[{"poster":"greatdeathz","date":"2016-01-18T04:43:55.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is your name supposed to be a mix of the anime gintama and guantanamo bay?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-17T23:26:12.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh they happen, just not to the people that deserve it","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-01-17T22:37:28.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont think, despite the immense popularity of the game, riot would want to remove every toxic player permanently or reform them harsher than what they're doing now. no doubt most of the people playing the game that are toxic are 12 year olds crying to their parents for new skins every week. plus we also wouldnt have forg1ven, a split mvp haha. but it is always possible riot bans like 10% of their player base permanently at this very moment and then they never recover and it could spiral out of control where people go and switch to dota for whatever following reasons. its just too unpredictable to see what happens.","replies":[]}]}
