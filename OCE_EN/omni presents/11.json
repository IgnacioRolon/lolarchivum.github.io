You need to give players an actual reason to go for objectives, especially when you play a fun game mode that means absolutely nothing other than keeping someone like myself on a positive win percentage on this map. They come here for fun, the same they do on TT, and all they do is run around and get kills.\r\n\r\nPlayers will take this same mentality into Ranked and just go for kills, I see it all the time. You need more of a reward when players take objectives to give them the precedent they deserve over getting a mass amount of kills.\r\n\r\nFFS, you CAN&#039;T WIN ANY GAME MODE WITHOUT GETTING THE DAMNED OBJECTIVES... OK, maybe you can if the minions do enough of your work on the objectives. But against smart opponents, players who know what it takes to win, if you continually ignore the objectives, the minions won&#039;t be able to get them in time before the enemy gets strong enough to match it with you and win.\r\n\r\nNow I am not here complaining about the rotating game mode, The Crystal Scar was removed for a reason, for this exact reason, players would join teams who knew exactly what to do and how to win, you capture 3 towers and sit under them. The towers help with the damage and if you control 3, your opponents nexus health will just drop until you win.\r\n\r\nBoring as fuck and not a good look for the game, but one that almost guarantees a win in each and every queue you join. Now that this new Dominion has no access between the 2 towers that cannot be captured, all you need to do is hold 2 towers and you win. This weekend is going to piss off a lot of players.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-05-27T14:48:46.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe because its too fucking complicated and it's on rotation let me not no what to do in peace.","replies":[{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2016-05-28T04:27:55.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rengorax,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=BkxHO0bR,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-05-27T14:48:46.867+0000)\n>\n> Maybe because its too fucking complicated and it&#x27;s on rotation let me not no what to do in peace.\n\nits not complicated at all you goddamn retard.\nyou right click on the fucking towers and stand in the middle without taking damage.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-05-28T06:54:48.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was a joke... get off your period you edgy hormonal %%%%.","replies":[{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2016-05-28T08:28:33.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-05-28T09:54:23.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Maybe because its too fucking complicated and it's on rotation let me not know what to do in peace\"\n\nYes that is a joke I don't know what realm you come from... \"it's on rotation let me not know what to do in peace\".
