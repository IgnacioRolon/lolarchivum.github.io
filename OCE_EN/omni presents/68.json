When I point out they had the worst score and my team also point out they had the worst score, they decided to note they had more assists. Once some of us pointed out KDA means nothing in Ascension, they went and AFK&#039;d in our base stating &quot;GL 4v5&quot;.\r\n\r\nIn almost every game I join some shit happens with players being assholes and in 99% of them, I have at LEAST my team, and if the chat spills into /ALL, the enemy team in most cases stating the player who is giving others shit as being the problem and the one who can&#039;t play. And more than I can remember to keep track, they start purposely making it worse by feeding, or going AFK, or just being trolls.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t care about players being assholes and most of the shit they say, but when they go AFK, start feeding, follow you around and steal your shit to try and make you play worse, or get personal with others, it makes the game no longer fun and today, first game, some ass decides to be a child, abuse others and go AFK when we point out they are the problem, turning a fun and winnable game basically into an instant shitfest.\r\n\r\nWhere is the incentive to play your game anymore Riot? Where is the fun? Where is the enjoyment when in most games you get a snot nosed little brat who 1. Doesn&#039;t know how to play and 2. Simply plays the blame game when they play bad. At least when I do bad I admit it, or at the least keep my mouth shut and not look for someone else to blame.\r\n\r\nThat pic, that is what Riot HQ looks like after 10 years, over flowing with saltiness. Your game Riot is no longer fun to play, nothing like it used to be and what I started with many years ago. I can&#039;t really say I have had fun, not with how the game has been in the past 6 months.","replies":[{"poster":"FlaskR","date":"2016-09-30T12:45:51.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not riots fault that the people playing it are dickheads","replies":[{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2016-09-30T14:42:49.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually it is riot's fault!\n\nLeague has 0 punishment system that WORKS!\n\nTakes 10 sec for trolls,feeders,toxic people to create a new account and do the same thing over and over!\n\nIf Riot permabanned people based on IP then no one would flame in game!\n\nAnd NO I don't give a flying fk about internet cafes and places with single IP's","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-10-01T01:13:07.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most people now have Dynamic IP addresses, which means their IP changes frequently. If you ban a troll this way, he can just restart his router or call his ISP to get a new IP.\n\nThe other issue is that if one person at a university or college gets IP banned, no one else can play (until their IP changes). So you're potentially punishing 100s of people as collateral for one ban.\n\nI hope that clarifies why **Riot** doesn't use IP bans ;)","replies":[]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-09-30T22:47:18.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IP?\nAre you talking about influence points or something?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-09-30T22:46:27.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't play something that would have people that are under level 25.\nBecause as soon as you hit level 25, It's all g and people aren't (as bad) jerks","replies":[]}]}
