Riven","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I hear people say Nasus counters Riven, yet 2 ranked games this season against a Riven I have lost lane terribly. Her Q combo will drop me down to like 30% health, so all she needs to do is get me down a little and give a full combo to kill me. Looking at my last game I died twice early, once outside tower and once inside tower range, from there I couldn&#039;t even sit under my tower and farm, she would just kill me.\n\nOnce laning phase was over I managed to get 6 kills and only die twice, but in laning phase even sitting under my tower she would just dive me, either kill me or drop me down to low health and proceed to dive me again for the kill. I have tried in both games once starting as corrupting potion, the other with cloth armour and health pot, yet both times I would fold even at level 1.\n\nIn every game so far Riven was either banned or chosen, and in both games I was top with her chosen she wrecked me, is Nasus really a counter or is Riven just too strong at the moment?\n\nBefore S6 I would have no issues against a Riven and enjoyed playing against her as it would be a fun lane that I had a good chance at winning.","replies":[{"poster":"Xenos11111","date":"2016-01-24T01:43:22.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any decent Riven should be able to shit on Nasus early game. Your only chance is surviving long enough to get {{item:3110}} before falling too far behind. Try to get babysit from your jungler, you'll need all the help you can get.\n\nAssuming you can keep up in farm, once you have {{item:3110}} you should be able to stomp her.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-01-24T12:25:51.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So why do people in my games tell me that Nasus is a counter? Everywhere I have read since getting stomped on tells me what you are telling me. I get so much flame for dying to her, even when I am under my tower at full health and die my team just give me shit for it.\n\nIs Riven currently that strong that your best bet is just to try and get her banned?","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-24T13:33:03.084+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"because he smashes her as soon as he gets first armor item + sheen + 100+ stacks","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"oOo0oOo0oOo0oOo","date":"2016-01-24T02:49:14.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the most thinly veiled QQ post I've ever seen","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-01-24T12:24:48.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And why do you think it is a QQ post?","replies":[]}]}]}
