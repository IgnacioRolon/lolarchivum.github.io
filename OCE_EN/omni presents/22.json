Today was my first day back since URF mode, my last game was my first ranked back.\r\n\r\nI go top Nasus, normal pick for low rank, our mid goes Riven, bot is Lucian. Top lane enemy Trynd goes mid, stands there and lets Riven kill him, LB shows up after the first wave arrives.\r\n\r\nTrynd than proceeds to troll ALL game, great I think, free win. But NOOOOOOO, our Lucian, constantly stating he doesn&#039;t know how to or like playing ADC proceeds not only to feed, but play like he is almost new to the game, than after some time proceeds to state &quot;Sorry, I am having a bad game&quot;. Looking at how he played this game and his last games (all of them) stats, he wasn&#039;t having a bad game, he is bad.\r\n\r\nSo going from a free win with a trolling Trynd, to having our own feeding ADC who had no idea, the game was a virtual 4v4 in the enemies favour given that Trynd wasn&#039;t feeding, he was just trolling so they should have had it better with Cait having not only a free lane, but getting fed also. I couldn&#039;t get fed top, Trynd was never in the lane.\r\n\r\nIf not for either myself or Riven, the enemy would have won easy. Our jungler had to babysit bot lane even with the enemy jungler going mid and top, and they still lost the lane with ease. All the enemy had to do was get Trynd to join in, in any capacity and they would have won.\r\n\r\nAfter the game our ADC was trying to defend himself with his 1/9 score by saying he is good and playing bad, the usual shit they spout. He is obviously not ready for ranked and could have lost us the game with him allowing Cait to get fed of him. The main issue is just that, the players are that bad that not only can they not defend, or that they can&#039;t push, it is that they cannot play without getting someone fed. And if no one on the other team also gets fed, it is game over, you just can&#039;t carry when your ADC goes 1/9 and the enemy ADC goes 14/6.","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-05-04T01:31:20.221+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"For every noob on your team that isn't ready for ranked, there is 1.25 noobs on the enemy team..\n\nNow tell me more about how noobs are keeping you down","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-05-04T11:03:11.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not noobs letting just me down, it's the whole low ranked queue that sucks balls.

Even when I get fed or get a free farm lane, there almost always is someone else who feeds the enemy and makes my day miserable.

The truth is no matter what hurdles you encounter throughout your climb and while at times it's very true that the reason you lost was because your team wasn't very good, the common denominator that you can affect each game is yourself. I mean surely there must be many ways in which you can improve such as roaming, objective control, warding, map awareness, pinging, itemization, team compositions. Sometimes even trying to support your team mate who has fallen behind can go a long way. The first step to climbing  is improving yourself to try and ensure that you end up with a situation where you contribute as much as you humanly can, not to simply winning your lane but also to the entirety of your team. There's always room for improvement. The reason some of the more skilled people climb more easily is because they know these things, and are able to use the tools at their disposal more effectively.\n\nAfterall, the enemy team is just as likely to have people equally as bad and even if the enemy team is fed, if your composition is good, if you can just hold out, you just might win. I've seen so many throws where the enemy team was absolutely dominating but then suddenly a single ace cost them the game or they are slowly overtaken at late game because they failed to end the game early enough.\n\nI mean it's amazing how a great {{champion:54}} ult can turn a game around completely.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-05-04T11:28:53.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Requiemsfire,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=eHAvWemM,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-05-03T21:40:57.985+0000)\n>\n> I mean surely there must be many ways in which you can improve such as roaming, objective control, warding, map awareness, pinging, itemization, team compositions.

I have been past gold rank in the past, all of it due to premaking a team almost every game.\n\nEverything you said above makes zero fucking difference if one of your opponents has 14 kills and 150 CS at the 20 minute mark unless someone on your team has the same, and even than it depends on who has those stats.\n\nSo many times I have seen players collapse in such a short time I wonder what capacity they have to even think, let alone comprehend how to play LoL.\n\nLet me summarise this:\nI ping A LOT and it makes no difference.\nI ward as much as I can, and if I didn't I wouldn't be able to evade the ganks that my team do NOT ping for.\nI get teams who refuse to ping, ward, roam, push, defend, or anything useful.\nLast game I had a bot in top who was set to farm, rather than team assist.\nThe only games I win, regardless of how fed I get, are the ones where my team don't collapse at a minimum. They don't need to get fed, they just need to stop being stupid. I couldn't even care less if they do feed, just as long as they can learn to defend and not lose 2 towers in 15 minutes.\n\nTop in that game didn't ping, for obvious reasons, and a jungle who never ganked, yet I still walked away with the best stats on my team even with all the 1v3 ganks I was dealing with.\n\nIf Malphite was actually a person, or someone who knew how to program a bot correctly, we probably would have won, but you can't do shit in a virtual 4v5 game.\n\nEVERY SINGLE GAME goes like this:\nTeam collapses, we lose.\nTeam does not collapse, fed, feeding or otherwise, we win.\n\nWhy? Because I don't fucking collapse, I don't lose my towers like a bitch and I play how you are meant to play. Gain CS, get kills IF YOU CAN, and group up. It's a bare minimum you need to do to win, and it is not just me, game after game I get both my team and the enemy openly bagging someone, somewhere stating how bad they are. I even get those games where my team bag me and blame me for the lose, while the enemy defend me stating it is not my fault, constantly. It is just premades trying to lay the blame on someone other than themselves and I can say that with 100% certainty, it has never been this bad in previous seasons.\n\nI should know, again in the past, I have been beyond gold with constant premades and at least gold without premades, this season I can barely keep myself in silver. When I do check who my team is grouping with, most games I find there are premades and in almost all of those games they are the ones who play the worst. This stupid queue system Riot put in place has ruined ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-05-04T13:36:37.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People are really bad atm. Like in my last game the first item that our Varus bought were berserker's greaves. While the enemy adc went for a Kirchei's shard. The opposition team got aced just to get the infernal dragon (they lost 2 towers along with that). Our jungler wandered through the enemy jungle aimlessly, got caught and died many times. We only won because top and mid were solid players and didn't feed, that's all.\nRanked is completely random. If you get guys that think of kills, you lose. If you get guys that just farm, don't do anything special, and push lanes, you win.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FrickingLasers","date":"2016-05-04T03:00:22.820+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fact that you had the entire lane to yourself as a Nasus and still not get fed shows the general lack of understanding of that champ.
