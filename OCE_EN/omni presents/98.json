Yeh you may get given 5 random champs you can&#039;t play and who are useless in URF, and may be given 5 who are OP and you just need to choose your best played champ, but at least you don&#039;t get a champ who is 100% useless and run out of re-rolls.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-09-25T03:09:02.358+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally i thought URF was great when it was yearly, but turned crap with the rotating game mode because a meta appeared.\n\nWith ARURF this doesn't occur, and while it's not always the best, it's better than being forced against teams with only OP picks, when your trying to dick around and have fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Icy Spectre","date":"2016-09-25T09:15:32.235+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd rather have meta than rng that decides who instawins.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-09-25T11:38:35.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having some choice is nice, but I would rather not have a lawn mower, a chainsaw and a zergling rush each and every game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2016-09-25T08:50:23.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well said\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}} \n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-09-25T23:37:44.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make both modes available for the weekend and see who plays what mode more.

However, I don't think ARURF is as bad as most people think; we get to see some non-meta URF champs like {{champion:10}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:98}} which can actually be pretty strong when played right (in my examples, they were the carries of their teams). Sure, people are kinda forced into it, but I think that we have a good amount of rerolls and the problem is that most people just use their rerolls too readily. \n\nWhen a new changes are suggested, it's difficult to predict how they'll turn out. With your idea, it is likely to solve the problem of getting weak champs, but by giving people a selection to choose from we might see the same group of champs appear over and over again, similarly to URF (but not as severe). It's an idea worth implementing though, and I think it would improve player satisfaction overall.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-09-25T02:52:45.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While you may see the same champ, it is not the same players of that champ. Look at last URF mode, I chose Jax like 99% of the time, and so far have seen him 3 times... in the last 3 games. Twice I had him.\n\nFirst game I had him and went 31/4, next game the enemy had him and went 8/11, I got him again and went 19/5. So while you may see Jax or Garen (again 3 games: them 10/15, Me 24/8, Me 18/17) all 6 of those games I won. I got Cass and went 15/8, mt teammate got her a few games later and went 6/4.\n\nSo no, it won't matter if you see the OP champs, it comes down to the player still and how they can handle these champs in URF mode.","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-09-25T23:35:13.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Omni Presents,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=ZU8JAb3g,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-09-25T02:52:45.115+0000)\n> So no, it won&#x27;t matter if you see the OP champs, it comes down to the player still and how they can handle these champs in URF mode.\n\nVery true. I got stomped 2 games in a row by 2 different Kats that both had the most kills in the entire game. 2 different players and both stacked a few Rabidons for nice effect. Later that day I got Kat, copied the same build they both had, pretty much full build and I did zero damage to anyone with the full combo. Infact I got deleted mid combo everytime, despite jumping in the middle of the pack when they all <15% health. Went 7/13/12. Absolute trash. So it's not the champs fault they are OP, its the user. Heck I watched a couple support champs near carry a game in decent hands.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BananaSlayerAMO","date":"2016-09-25T04:26:51.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's still boring seeing the same champs in almost every game tho.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-09-25T12:45:29.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There should seriously be bans... It's so annoying going up against/having a zed or Leblanc because they just carry the game. Even if we could just get rid of some cancer champions out of the pool of random champs it would be great.\n\nQuite frankly, I think AR-URF is just a worse version of URF, for two reasons:\n\n1. The game is over before its begun. Some games of AR-URF are simply just winnable, because your team gets 5 shitty URF champs, and all they need is to get one op URF champ like zed, and the games over. Where's the fun in that? Which leads to my second reason...\n\n2. URF is meant to be a FUN game mode. Who gives a shit if everyone picks the same URF champions? They are picked because they are FUN TO PLAY. The game isn't meant to be fair or balanced, but there's still no fun whatsoever in being one shot by zed when your playing Vayne because you had no choice of the champion you played.\n\nHowever, at least we got URF again, and even if we can't choose champions it's better than nothing. And hey, at essence AR-URF is actually pretty fun, and I never knew that URF Kled would be good, but because of AR-URF I do now.\n\nSo in conclusion it has it's pros and it's cons, but the game mode definitely needs some tweaking.","replies":[]}]}
