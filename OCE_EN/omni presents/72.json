It should be super easy to match up evenly when there are enough players to do so.\r\n\r\nMy first ranked game tonight, and my first in many weeks, if not months, I finally get a game where at least 8 other players on the map are so evenly matched it was actually a good game that was well fought by both teams to the end. And because my team didn&#039;t fail hard in the first 10 minutes, I was able to get on top of my mid opponent easier and bring my team into mid game where we were able to stay on top to push for the win.\r\n\r\nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/132938896/41839391?tab=overview - I got most of my kills early to mid, Vayne and Ekko got theirs mid to late, a good game, a good win.\r\n\r\nFast forward to the next game and I get this: http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/132939952/41839391?tab=overview. The same game time, but a vastly different story. My team failed miserably, by 19 minutes we had lost both bot and mid lane towers and with Lee constantly ganking top with me keeping Poppy to 2 kills the whole game, that should not have happened.\r\n\r\nI get constant players who go AFK, players who feed, players who can&#039;t hold a lane longer than metre ruler and even the odd player who openly admits &quot;I can&#039;t play XX role / champion&quot;, in ranked. I mean, they choose what role they want, yet they choose a role they can&#039;t play. I get ONE good game a month if I am lucky, otherwise nothing for the rest of the time.\r\n\r\nWhy do I get better games outside ranked than I do inside it? It should be the mode that experienced players try to play and try to play well, not the other way around. Players constantly come here and play absolute rubbish, you look at their last games and they are all rubbish and all ranked, and you wonder if Riot have it set right to allow anyone with 16 champions at level 30 to simply join.\r\n\r\nIs it not a race to see who can get to level 30 and into ranked first. You don&#039;t simply buy 16 champions and join ranked because you can, you need to know how to play more than one champion in one lane. You can&#039;t level up to level 30 and think &quot;Great, I got this&quot;. Low level opponents have been in the game for a few weeks or months, they are mostly bad and you really have no idea what experience the level 30&#039;s have.\r\n\r\nIt is sad how much better the game is outside ranked that it makes me wonder if Riot even really care about anyone but the high ranked players.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-05-10T22:59:57.942+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I blame Zed.\n\nSo many people ONLY play Zed, cos of faker and other things. Then Zed gets banned, and all of a sudden they have to play some champ they have never heard of before, and feed the lane only to AFK to go play Zed on another account. Zed is the seed of all badness in league. \n\n\nI know the feeling though, i had a game not long ago, i picked Leona because like usual, no one on our team picked any tanks, and the enemy team had 3. \nEveryone on my team picked the squishiest champs, then it was last pick's turn, they were top, they had Xin as their preferred champ, everyone asked them to go tanky, then without any communication, they switched to Quinn, didn't communicate the entire game Fed Mundo in 5 minutes then AFKed. \n\nAlso Riot does only care about higher ranked players, thats common knowledge.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Belrick","date":"2016-05-11T10:38:37.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HHAHAHAH i spoke too soon\nLucian mid 1/6 (free tower kill) by 10min\n\nTrist bot, 30 cs to cait 68 cs 10 min\nA 1/4 Garen in laning phase 25 min in and baron taken 0 3 in dragons \n\n*facepalm*\nriot read my post and trolled me","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-05-11T10:26:48.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"_What makes you think your **Nasus** game was not a fair match?_\n\n+ You actually lost with a **12.6k** gold difference in that match, which is less than the **17.8k** gold difference in your **Malzahar** win. \n\n In gold difference, the **Nasus** game was actually much closer. \n\n+ We can compare other stats too. \n\n In your **Malzahar** win the enemy team only managed to get _1 turret_ the whole game, no dragons or barons. In your **Nasus** loss you managed to get 2 turrets and 1 dragon.\n\n Your **Nasus** game was closer in this respect as well.\n\nThe matches are actually relatively similar if you ask me. I think it's just about perspective. When you're winning the game looks very different to when you're in a loosing position.\n\nHowever you are correct that some games do tend to snowball in low elo. Many players don't understand how to stop falling behind and it can snowball out of control sometimes.\n\nI hope this helped you see this in a different light.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Belrick","date":"2016-05-11T09:03:23.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel your pain.
