The game however, has NO IDEA I was playing this way, it only recognised my stats. Although you CAN make it recognise damage taken as actually put effort into making it a high scoring stat, I was second most taken and with second assists on my team, 1+1= I done SOMETHING to slow the enemy down.\r\n\r\nBut no, I get a bad KDA and least damage done total so I get a shot scorecard, not taking anything into account that I got the best score on my team.\r\n\r\nYou have your priorities wrong Riot, really wrong. You are rewarding single play and helping those who do nothing but get kills get a good score and limiting those who actually know how to win in getting bad scores.\r\n\r\nWhat, did you want me to be selfish, use an assassin and do nothing but get kills? Because that is what your score system is telling me to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-08-15T21:55:50.604+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"its ascension. literally who cares. mastery shouldn't even be in that gamemode","replies":[]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-08-17T11:11:18.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't even get tokens in Ascension.
