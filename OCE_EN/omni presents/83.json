One of those I think is the Witchcap, a combination of Deathcap and Zhonyas and WAY to cheap to get. Since this has came back I see more and more players taking this item as one of the first they get, sometimes even before boots. Than all you need to do is max CDR and get some easy kills, especially if half your team has one.\r\n\r\nI can understand the need for this item in 3v3 and any other changes that are offered, but for 6v6 it should be more about team work, not picking 6 champions, building them and playing simply just for the win no matter what. There are even those who take TP, allowing them to get across the map faster or recall quicker so they can survive longer, a cheap strategy planned around the &#039;must win&#039; mentality.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t play this game because I have to win each and every game, I play for fun. A few games ago I played against an LB, she would only attack if she could get the kill, than run and run and run until she was safe back in her base, not once did she ever stay with her team and because she was taking the kills and leaving, her team were virtually under farmed and I could see the lose coming.\r\n\r\nThat is not fun for us simply waiting for an LB to kill one of us and run away, that is not fun for her team knowing the kill will be stolen and not put to good use. It was virtually 5v5, she would kill someone and run and the person who is overfarmed and not putting that to good use is a waste of space. I see this game and game again, players taking specific combinations of champions simply because all 6 of them are this or that, i.e. tanky with one or more CC each.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone find it fun to win when you don&#039;t even need to try? Like those games you know are over at the 5 minute mark for one reason or another?","replies":[{"poster":"ElementGamer01","date":"2015-06-06T22:35:17.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't like TT Hexakill :( I prefer 3v3 TT better because it just seems to be a massive 6v6 fight all the time and I always die because the champs I like to play require some early farming but I always am farming but then get 4 man ganked{{champion:32}} {{item:3070}} .

All you need to do is take the items and champs that exploit the fact it is a 3v3 map design and get free wins.\n\nGame after game after game I see players using Withcap and with 100 health left over after you have popped all your skills they come back and burst you down. The combination of Withcap and CDR means you can burst someone, hit witchcap and burst that very same person. Basically every second team fight means you can effectively be 2 people, use your skills, avoid the death and use your skills again.","replies":[]}]}]}
