Next best on our team was Gold V (0LP), than a Silver 1 on enemy team on their 5th promo game, so basically both the same rank.\r\n\r\nThe so called Platinum player, sucked ass, completely. I at least thought we would have a fight on our hands, but no. I kicked Wukong out of the top lane, beat him so hard he actually left before 10 minutes and didn&#039;t come back, both Bronze 1.\r\n\r\nI know this was a normal game, but if the ranks have anything to do with anything in this game, than the enemy team should have won easy.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-03-11T10:26:41.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranked MMR has nothing to do with Normal games.\n\nIf the plat player didn't play to plat standards they likely are having a bad day/match or bought the account/rank.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-03-11T11:03:28.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeh but a platinum getting smashed by a bronze?
