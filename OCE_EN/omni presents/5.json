I will start.\r\n\r\nI hate the most players who nark of their team mates for reasons outside their control. If you have a bad game it does not mean you are bad, there are other factors at play.\r\n\r\nJust had a game with the enemy Vayne had an Annie support. Our team had a Ali and Jinx. Annie support does not work, not at least in Bronze, not when the enemy has 4/5 champions at level 4 or better. One stun per 4 attacks with no real damage since she can&#039;t get CS and buy anything decent.\r\n\r\nReally, someone, anyone answer me this, WHY go Annie support? I see no real reason for it, higher ranks it may work if the AD is a god and can pretty much 1v2 and stay alive until the Annie Ult stun. Otherwise I see no real reason to have a support who is neither a tank, a healer or has some constant CC.\r\n\r\nIf someone is playing bad, look around you and try to find out why, don&#039;t just yell at them for no reason. maybe they are being ganked more than you are ganking, maybe they have no assistance in their lane, maybe the enemy is just that much better, or hell, they got counter picked and screwed over by anticipating who they were to be playing against.\r\n\r\nIt is not always the players fault as to why they are playing bad, so don&#039;t go and roast them when they have a bad game, not especially since it could be your fault as to why they are playing bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Slycandicem","date":"2015-09-03T10:29:31.478+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate people playing ranked that obviously have no idea what they are doing.
