This game used to be good and enjoyable in ranked, not anymore. At least I am fucking trying to point out a problem with this game, but no everyone wants to dig their heads in the sand and do nothing. Fight back and let Riot know there are issues. Almost every ranked loss I get into something goes wrong that is not my fault.\r\n\r\nLast game an AFK for the first part of the game, our jungler, when he came back he never ganked any of the lanes whilst their jungler helped bot get fed and made our ADC rage quit because &quot;They are too fed&quot;. You tell me, is that my fault? Is that anything I can do to stop happening? Is there anything I can do to win a mostly 4v5 game?\r\n\r\nOr am I right in saying there is a fucking problem? I was 3/4/2 at one point in that game, even with no jungler helping and a bot lane feeding, but the minute bot lane quit, actually quit, openly admitted to giving up and quitting 0.3 seconds after his 8th death, I couldn&#039;t do anything anymore and starting dying a lot more.\r\n\r\n3/8 ADC (rage quit, I was 3/5 and hadn&#039;t died for 7 minutes to that point), 0/10 Support, 1/8 Jungler. I get top damage in both categories on our team and aside from our ADC, second lowest damage taken which shows I was actually involved in trying to kill the enemy and team fight properly. Our first tower in bot lane, gone 8 minutes in. 8 minutes in I was still poking the enemy and trying to get CS.\r\n\r\nWhilst I hadn&#039;t wrecked the enemy mid laner, I was 3/3 by the time we took their second mid tower at 21 minutes and 3/4 at 24 minutes when we lost our first mid lane tower, a far cry from being a combined 1/14 bot lane when that tower finally fell along with the second bot tower.\r\n\r\nGame before that I get counter picked being second pick (third overall), have our jungler simply giving me shit for almost the entire 51 minutes instead of trying to help and not realise I couldn&#039;t really do much in lane and racked up 9 deaths in 21 minutes. For the next 30 minutes after we started grouping I died TWICE and got 7 kills. Yes, 0/9 in the first 21 minutes. But 7/2 in the next 30. I got countered in lane and had zero help, instead I get an asshole who thinks it better to just abuse me, but still actively helped our team win considering I hadn&#039;t lost our top tower until the 26 minute mark.\r\n\r\nWhilst I fed for the first portion of that game, I still managed to do the right thing for the team as best I could, I defended my lane, slowed my opponent down enough so they don&#039;t roam and reek havoc and stay in the game until the team fights began. I don&#039;t get it, how can someone not defend until the team is capable of organising and winning team fights so we can push to the end and get that win? That is the easiest part of the game.\r\n\r\nIt is not hard, you learn to defend, get 4 lane players who can actually defend, get CS and get the whole team ready and not lose towers in less than 10 minutes, and you get a win. The minute a tower falls you end up with 2-4 players congregating in mid and it&#039;s mostly game over.","replies":[{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2016-04-19T15:02:29.144+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"riot don't give a flying fk as long as they making millions via hextech chest for nerds!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shana Rei","date":"2016-04-21T00:26:41.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Last game an AFK for the first part of the game, our jungler, when he came back he never ganked any of the lanes whilst their jungler helped bot get fed and made our ADC rage quit because \"They are too fed\".\"\n\nHahahahahahahahahahahahaha oh my goodness. Is that for real, do you not understand how this game works? If I was you and my AFK jungler came back I'd be telling them NOT TO GANK because they are already behind. They need to play catch up. Why didn't you offer your bot lane a lane swap?\n\nSeriously there are so many options to play around a 4v5 and even 3v5 and still win when being behind and this is coming from a silver.\n\nNumber one rule of any online multiplayer game. Never assume your team mates are A: good, B: smart.\n\nWatch them, be selfish and you might just surprise yourself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AngelKD","date":"2016-04-20T11:04:11.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a team game- sometimes you get a great team and sometimes you don't.

A jungler's role is NOT to gank, but most people agree that they should provide map pressure in some way (through vision, ganks, etc.). If the jungler was AFK, he would probably want to farm up so he isn't so behind.\nIf bot was struggling where were you? League is a TEAM game. Did you flame the ADC when they were frustrated? Or did you flame them?\n\n> Or am I right in saying there is a fucking problem?

Even if you can't, just because you are in an unfavourable matchup, doesn't mean you are guaranteed to lose. The better player will win. \nRiot made a mute button for a reason. Maybe the jungler wasn't helping since you were toxic (judging by your attitude)?\n\n> Whilst I fed for the first portion of that game, I still managed to do the right thing for the team as best I could, I defended my lane, slowed my opponent down enough so they don&amp;#039;t roam and reek havoc and stay in the game until the team fights began.

That is the easiest part of the game.\n> See? You will sometimes feed, just like your bot lane. People probably feel the same way when you go 0/9. Good job on coming back though. Also, you shouldn't expect other players to do what you think is best, sometimes its best to tell them what would be useful for them to do.\n\n> It is not hard, you learn to defend, get 4 lane players who can actually defend, get CS and get the whole team ready and not lose towers in less than 10 minutes, and you get a win.

YOu should go into every game assuming they know nothing about the game. Tell them what to do if they are doing something wrong.
