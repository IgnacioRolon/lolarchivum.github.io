The last video I just watched the made me want to post here, a level 12 Rengar, 3 full AD items, T1 Boots and a sword, triple kill against players his own level. I understand if Rengar was fed, HE WASN&#039;T, but got a triple no problems, and the times he couldn&#039;t get a triple? Just run away no problem.\r\n\r\nIt is the same I watch all videos online, the gap of imbalance is just widening. 3 seasons ago the game was somewhat balanced, but it has gone far from that now, and Riot, you will start to lose more players unless you stop releasing so many and start balancing what there is.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m out, forever.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-01-06T08:28:02.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Riot said they wanted to remove Rengar's one-shot potential and give opponents \"more time to react\" yet now he can one-shot people easier and in their own champion spotlight they show him two shot a Xerath.

GG Riots common sense has gone down the drain.\n\nFirstly, Riot always make their champions appear stronger in the spotlight than they actually are in practice, because that's precisely what promotional montages are supposed to do, only showcasing \" the good\" and not so much about \"the bad\"; this applies to literally any other hero-based (or fixed-character-based) title. We could go on arguing about whether that should be considered ethical or whatnot but that would be for another thread.\n\nSecondly, an assassin (most likely fed too because of the promotional montage shenanigan) who could 2 shot a burst mage? OUTRAGEOUS!","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-01-06T12:29:07.028+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot updated the assassins to specifically add \"more time to react\" as I said and they didn't accomplish that with Rengar at all. They changed his q so players couldn't just press it moments before leaping into a fight and have it trigger automatically on his leap, so what did they do? Create an ability that gives him extra range and can still be used mid-leap to auto trigger when he lands. They also gave his W the ability to remove cc which is the exact counter to assassins, and gave his ultimate a longer duration + a guaranteed crit. With his ult + E and  his ferocity empowered Q dealing ridiculous 170+ damage per hit, he can still one-shot adcs, mages and other assassins. He can do this with only  2 items and 5 stacks on his bone tooth necklace which can easily be achieved by 20 minutes (as long as you fight every champion on the enemy team your likely to get a stack every time)  \n\nKeep in mind I don't just rant about these stupid champs without playing them myself and testing everything I can. I can tell you now with every situation I've been in with Rengar, fed or not fed, I am still able to do an overloaded amount of damage in such a short amount of time. Given that champs like talon and kat were successful in their updates and provide lots of unique ways to play AS and AGAINST them I would of hoped Rengar would of been the same but his kit in merely just a more \"upgraded version\" then before. I will admit though the changes to his ferocity (losing ferocity out of combat) was taking the step in the right direction however they failed to keep it that way when they added in the extra ferocity upon leaping and changing the number of stacks to 4 which just compensated for the somewhat \"nerf\" they gave to his passive in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"Lajneen","date":"2017-01-06T17:08:20.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fitzky,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=irByYZqw,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-01-06T12:29:07.028+0000)\n>\n> Riot updated the assassins to specifically add &quot;more time to react&quot;\n\nAnd look how well that turned out. Now they're so useless to the point where intentionally feeding is less of a liability to your team than playing an assassin.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-06T23:25:56.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know what EUW meta is like, though I'm trying it out over the week on a alt whilst I'm on holiday in the uk, but I don't think any assassin is in inherently a worse place than they were in before the assassin class update (even shaco who changes I've been complaining about on pretty much every board). \n\nI mean Fizz can basically be played as a tank again and does even more damage when done right, though the guppy shark is pretty underwhelming if you're bad at fizz. Katarina became alot harder to play, but she's a little stronger once mastered. Zed kinda got a few buffs that have helped bring him back. Talon got an entirely new identity and playstyle but his map presence during the midgame is outstanding. Shaco had a bunch of his powerspikes messed with and he lost alot of damage and scaling but the way he's always worked and been played, through items and mindgames, damage nerfs aren't going to stop him. Kha'zix is far stronger now than before in pretty much every single way. Rengar became more difficult to play but alot more powerful once mastered and has more damage and counterplay options (I find the cleanse is more a getaway tool, or to deal with tanks and lockdown champions rather as a way to get past being cc'd on the engage). Twitch got his roaming nerfed a little but his laning is stronger. Vayne is basically the same but now doesn't get stopped by pink wards and she might have gotten a few other buffs. Tank Yasou got some nerfs but I'm very glad they did this, because assassins shouldn't be built as tanks unless your toplane darius goes full ap or your trying to mess with friends.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-06T08:39:20.116+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game has never been balanced though, each season just has different broken things.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2017-01-07T15:21:57.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Omni Presents back at it again with the s***posting.
