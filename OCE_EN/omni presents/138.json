Yet, sometimes it is always the case and not just a little bit better, but a lot better. I am not fused about the premades being better or worse, you have an equal chance of getting good and bad premades on either team and heavily influencing the game, the same chance of not getting premades and the same chance of getting premades who match the skill of the solo players.\r\n\r\nIt is not the skill I am worried about. Of late I have seen premades stick together, either they stick together and blame the other players for the lose, or stick together and just simply not assist the non premades. Most recently I have had a bot duo and jungle premade, no ganks mid, never, not even an attempt. Jungle simply sat in jungle and ganked bot regularly. Same for top, the only time he went near top was to get between the jungle sides.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the game, even though I was doing quite well, same stats as the enemy Yas, the three premades still threatened both top and mid and reports for losing the game... yet they refused to help us, not even in the team fight stages.\r\n\r\nAnd that is my main concern, I see premades blaming others for the lose, doesn&#039;t matter whosse fault it was, it is simply the non premades fault. I see premades just refusing to help, ever, even in the team fights they would rather see the non premade engage and than laugh when they run away and let him die. Than there are those who just talk shit, constant BM even if you are playing well. There are those who purposely troll and laugh at you, refuse to surrender, you get the idea, I have had much more premades of late that are more of a hindrance than a help.","replies":[]}
