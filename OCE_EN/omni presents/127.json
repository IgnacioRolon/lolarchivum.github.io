No errors or anything I can report, just no client.\r\n\r\nAnyone else getting this and any advice they can give? My computer has no issues running the game when it is running, 60 FPS in windowed mode and hundreds of FPS in full screen, even when I run multiple programs or record my game I still have no issues, just getting into and out of the game is the problem.","replies":[]}
