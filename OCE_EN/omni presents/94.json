Why go into ranked and go AFK for a stupid reason? I have now had 13 ranked games, easily half of those had an AFK on my team, more than half had players with shitty attitudes. I don&#039;t give a flying fuck if you are bad, just don&#039;t go around yelling at others and going AFK because you are butthurt.\r\n\r\nPlayers are stuck at low silver or bronze not because of player skill or match ups, but because players are cunts and it for one makes me feel less like playing, especially when there is an AFK, I just can&#039;t be fucked once someone leaves, I have not had many wins over time with a 4v5 game, even when I still do try to win.\r\n\r\nMy last game I had a score of 1/1 until Lee went AFK, than I actually bothered reading the chat and the rest of my team were just yelling at each other. We got over run and because my score starting failing I started to cop shit for nothing.\r\n\r\nSomething needs to be done, if someone leaves for X amount of minutes or more I think the game should not count for any rank gain or lose, I&#039;m, not talking like 30 seconds, because than Premades can leave just before the game ends and stop any progression.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m talking something like 5, maybe 10 minutes or more being AFK or something.","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-08-30T12:11:33.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How dare you come thinking there will ever be improvement with this flawed new system?","replies":[]}]}
