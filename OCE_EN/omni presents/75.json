Because that doesn't count as a real win right? Sounds just as fair as not losing LP if a teammate afks.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-09-09T11:53:57.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I do. I always think if it is fair that you don't lose any LP when there are AFK, than you don't win any either.\n\nIt is the same argument that many use time and time again, if you have an AFK on your team, it will be the same chance that there is an AFK on the enemy team. This is the opposite, instead of losing LP for an AFK and gaining LP for an easy win, you both gain and lose nothing.\n\nAt least this way when you end up with the 4 AFK on one team, or any amount, those remaining players at least know they can run head first and simply have nothing to lose. On the opposite side, if I was playing and the enemy went AFK and I knew there was nothing to win I would not try so hard to finish the game faster, I would enjoy myself more.\n\nI hate losing because of someone else doing something out of my control, I hate more winning when the enemy has no chance of fighting back.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-09T13:03:44.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys we are losing, one of you AFK so we don't lose LP.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-09-09T14:58:42.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/AhNp7nVE-afks-gone-mad-afks-gone-mad-afks-gone-completley-mad-ranked-discussion","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-09T17:29:28.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And?\n\nMy point still holds, get someone to afk and focus on defense to get to the timer.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-09-10T11:45:19.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeh than that person who went AFK gets punished and stopped from playing ranked for some time, this will make them think twice about going AFK.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-08T14:44:20.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This deserves all of the upvotes.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-08T16:16:14.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you get In to gold  and up you get a lot less afk and or dc in game","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-08T16:48:37.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's fucking funny, there are just as many mate.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-09-09T11:56:12.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly when, if ever, do the AFK's either stop or slow down some?\n\nI do not have the best schedule and cannot find the same time each day to play a game, that rules out a ranked team and playing Duo will only guarantee one person is left standing, the other 3 can still fuck off and do what they want.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-09-09T12:08:01.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it is a part of playing with twelvies that afks will happen.
