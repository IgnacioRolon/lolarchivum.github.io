I see players time again who finish with a high KDA, yet low damage to turrets and it is the same in other game modes, high KDA, low damage done, focusing on nothing more than kills. When I do this, I generally have less wins. Yes, killing someone will force them out of lane, but getting them to go B is also a win in lane and gives you a chance to push. Plus, when you do push and get objectives, you either force the enemy to defend, or lose more in lane.\n\nTL;DR - I want to focus on winning, not on just killing other players and since Riot has made this game from the beginning to, you know, KILL THE NEXUS, maybe they should rework their scorecards to reflect this so players will focus on winning, not just farming, kills and staying alive.","replies":[{"poster":"cardmaster458","date":"2016-07-24T07:11:46.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree with this statement, riot can you change score card to as is said above","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-07-25T11:08:15.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just finished a Siege game, 22:30 TOTAL for a win.\n\nWhen you come across players like that, those who run instead of fighting, WTF can you do to increase your KDA? You can't and you suffer for it because someone else had a longer game or played against more aggressive players.\n\nIt is a joke and I should just give up on the scorecards and simply focus on the wins.","replies":[{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-07-25T19:13:40.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"welcome to what the entire community of MOBA gaming needs to understand, \n\nto improve your win rates, focusing on objectives and fighting to control them is the ideal situation.\n\nKDA is nothing if it steers teams away from taking your objectivies... Whats a few deaths to hold out longer? Just gotta make those deaths worth it, kill or not. Still aim to contribute as best you can.\n\n\nEdit; Its like why Sivir is such a popular ADC in Ranked play. Her push power is obscene and gross, even if you farm her in team fights, if Sivir switches to decent split pushing... Not much you can do to stop her breaching every turret with just 2 waves of minions and basic items.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-07-27T12:25:02.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No one is going to learn this, it has taken 5 seasons for Riot to introduce the scorecards and now all that is doing is putting the focus on kills and farm over objectives.\n\nIt is no wonder this game has gone so much downhill this season with Riot trying so hard to put the focus away from what is actually important.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
