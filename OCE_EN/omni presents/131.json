We need a pre-requisite for ranked play regarding each champion, not just the amount owned.\n\nI just played with someone who admitted so far going 0/9 in placements, had a terrible score and further admitted to not knowing how to play said champ. Seriously, going into Ranked and learning how to play is BULLSHIT. This is the kind of shit that pisses me off, you knowingly playing the Ranked mode, the supposedly most competitive mode in this game outside tournaments, and you do it knowing you are most likely going to suck ass and lose?\n\nThere is absolutely NOTHING stopping me from choosing any said role, taking any old champ I just brought, hell even just trolling and taking whoever for any lane I feel like it and just screwing with people, you never know, I may get enjoyment out of it.\n\nSo I suggest some discussions:\n - Personal rank scores so when you have said players who give no shits you can at least still gain something\n - Pre-requisite for each individual champ before being allowed to go Ranked\n - Or whatever\n\nAs I always say, I don&#039;t care for winning or losing, I care most about having a good and fair match with 10 players who actually care to play well. If a player is knowingly joining a game with a champ they have no idea about AND being on a 9 game losing streak, possibly due to playing champions they don&#039;t know how to play, that annoys me.","replies":[]}
