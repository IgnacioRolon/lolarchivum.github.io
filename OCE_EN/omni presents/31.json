Her ult literally makes her invulnerable given that no burst damage is around and she can continue attacking. If you build her right she's virtually unkillable. I do agree that her vitals are confusing and hard to hit, which is a downfall. It is a drastic change from the old Fiora though, her ult was entirely changed.","replies":[]}]}
