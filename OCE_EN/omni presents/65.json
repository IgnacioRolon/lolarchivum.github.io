But AP assasins are better off thanks to this patch's snowballing potential. LeBlanc, Fizz and Akali are doing quite well right now IMO.\n\nDon't say they haven't tried to balance it, people on PBE were worried about too much AD so Riot tried to keep AP laners relevant while still allowing for more early game potential.\n\n1. AP per level buff added to blue buff.\n2. AD junglers more prominent in jungle. These guys have little use for Blue Buff and often give it to mid.\n3. Buffed AP auto-attack damage to turrets.\n4. Buff to Mejai's Soulstealer and removal of Sword of the Occult.\n\nThis patch may not be perfect, but it's pre-season and you need to expect that. This is the single largest patch we've probably ever had, don't be unreasonable and complain about balance. Now if this were to continue into the ranked season... That would be different.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-11-14T11:50:29.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The blue buff was great, but that involves teamwork, the amount of shitty players that steal the blue, even after I do most damage, and even ones with no AP or Mana is ridiculous, they say they need the CDR...\n\nI do like the jungle buffs and AP buffs. But it is still too much Ad damage from ranged. I just tried Kog twice in TT, if I had a real team, a tank or some CC, I would have wrecked them hard and Kog in the last patch was pretty much dead in the water. I am about to go through all the ranged AD to see how they hold up, but so far I think they have been given too much.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-11-14T21:05:51.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you say is true, ADs are over-tuned this patch. I just wanted to make sure you appreciated what Riot did to try and keep some AP mids and Tops relevant. You didn't come off that way on your first post. I'm sure next patch or the one after that, they'll buff a few APs anyways.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
