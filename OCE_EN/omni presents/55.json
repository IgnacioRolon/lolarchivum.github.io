Those type of players are also the same type who give no shits about anyone but themselves, will almost never be with the team and only attack when they have a chance at a kill, then proceed to complain some more about everyone else and how it is not their fault they are losing.\r\n\r\nNow you&#039;re probably thinking why I don&#039;t just mute the player, that is not the entire issue, muting them only stops them from talking to you, it does nothing to help with their bad attitude. The bad players I can deal with, you can tell they are just having a bad day, some bad games, nothing serious. But the really shitty ones are the ones I worry about, their attitude doesn&#039;t just stop at them spouting abuse, but they have that &#039;I am better than everyone&#039; attitude and that shows with how they play.\r\n\r\nMuting someone doesn&#039;t stop them not giving 2 fucks about anyone but themselves and you are still going to be 1 man down with their screw the team attitude. That is where the real thoughts need to come into play about stopping someone playing in the same games as you. Let&#039;s look at that player I got last game, ~35 minutes of a 42 minute game I got shit from him, most of that time he would say something he was either farming in the jungle away from the team, or running from the enemy. The only time he attacked was when the enemy was low health, or it was a 1v1 guaranteed kill.\r\n\r\nEven if I didn&#039;t stop him playing in my games, there would almost be a 100% chance he would put me on a block list, he was that type of player spouting shit about silver players, always thinking it was someone else&#039;s fault. Guarantee he would block me and probably 2 others in that game, that means I get one less person to group with, he gets 3, only shooting himself in the foot.\r\n\r\nTL;DR - That is what needs to be taken into consideration, while I block some players who have a shit attitude, how many players are they blocking thinking they are above them and must play with players who are better? They will only make it harder for themselves to get a game and end up continually blocking players they think are below them until there is no one else left and their queue times go up shit creek.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2016-01-17T14:15:21.366+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do realise that TL:DR means \"Too long, didn't read\" RIGHT?","replies":[]},{"poster":"deadmau5","date":"2016-01-17T14:20:30.828+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually like this idea, but I don't exactly think its promoting what a healthy and teamwork based community needs. In fact this could lead to an increasingly damaging prospect to the game, for example. Say you're in game, and you don't like somebody, your usual response to them goes something like this...\n\nPlayer: \"you're trash, uninstall now\"\nYou: \"Whatever kid, muted and reported\"\n\nNow from this, most people won't really care if they're muted, nor reported, but when you take into the factor of never playing with them again it could turn out nasty, for example...\n\nPlayer: \"you're trash, uninstall now\"\nYou: \"Whatever kid, i'm going to block you so I never have to play with you again\"\n\nI could see this going two ways, a) they don't care and don't want to see you again, or b) it (almost certainly) will result in abuse being hurled towards you and will only hurt the situation more.\n\nI think its important to remember that League is a team game, and I think if anything there should be an option allowing you to match with a player more frequently that you had a good game with, rather than an option denying you to match with a player you had a bad experience with.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-01-21T02:56:38.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally think not being able to block them is worse, or more so allowing them to block us. It's the same if they were banned more regularly, they learn faster to stop being c**ts. Time and time again I see players stating \"I don't care, the reports don't do anything\". This only tells me that they know this as they are assholes regularly and don't get pinned for it.\n\nMost of these realy assholes, the ones that shouldn't even be allowed to live, those are the ones who will block players the most and only hurt themselves, if the bans worked properly than I wouldn't be talking about this as they would just get banned and there would be no issue.\n\nAs for what you said, if someone told another to uninstall, that is part of the issue and where this whole debate comes from, what are you doing telling someone that in the first place? You should either try help them, or just let them be. They are either having a bad day or being outplayed, it happens and they should't be condemned for it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Saturok","date":"2016-01-18T20:50:15.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generally, if you are in a constant state of being surrounded by negative, rude or insulting people there is a good chance that you are contributing to this. \n\nMaybe work on how you interact with your team mates and see if you can create positive atmospheres where people are hesitant to turn to 'Asshole' behaviour.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-01-21T02:29:14.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have played against the same toxic shitheads in many games before, ALWAYS the same person with the same shit attitude and the same crap excuses, the same game play, the same shit over and over from the same people.\n\nIt's crap when people say \"Oh, but it must be you\", there is always that one specific player that creeps up, doesn't give 2 shits about anyone but themselves and not only does their attitude in what they say show, but their game play also. Sometimes you get the ones who play well but talk shit, sometimes you get the ones who don't talk, but play only for themselves.\n\nI played with someone towards the end of season 5, 3 separate games over 5 days, in the first 2 he gave us all attitude, in the third game he started giving shit in champ selection. That what the worst one I remember as all three games were promos, all three were loses with him in jungle never ganking any lane, the rest of my team in all games complaining about him also.\n\nI don't say anything to my team period unless it's something good, asking for help, trying to get some objectives, or defending myself or my team against assholes. If you play like shit, so be it, you don't deserve to have anything bad said.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-01-17T18:45:38.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the chances of you playing someone again are slim to none during peak hours.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-01-18T22:04:32.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry mate that is bollocks.\n\nIf you queue immediately after match chances are high. 5 min wait usually avoids this.
