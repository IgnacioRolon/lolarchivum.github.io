On top of that I regularly get the most CS, the most damage TAKEN and not always the most deaths, I am Yi FFS, how can you out tank a tank AND stay alive longer?\r\n\r\nThere was a game recently, can&#039;t remember if it was a win or lose, but I got the most of everything out of both teams. I am constantly staring at players on my team who are so bad they should probably go back to bots. Bot lane in last game went 3/11 and 1/13.\r\n\r\nIsn&#039;t MM supposed to be fair and match you with players around your skill level? Or is it simply just placing me into games that match both teams skill level and forcing me to carry hard?\r\n\r\nI would be happy to wait an extra few minutes, even going over 5 minutes would be fine if I got grouped with players who actually cared to play and not complain than refuse to help us or go AFK, feed, get 40 CS as the ADC in 24 minutes. The list goes on, but ranked or normals, they are both quite bad at the moment with who I am being matched with.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t care for the lose or win, I just want fair games.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-20T15:41:59.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">In my last 11 games I have gotten the champion I wanted in the lane I wanted, that would be Yi in the jungle or Yi top in TT.\n>8 out of 9 of those games I have dealt the most damage on my team\n>7 out of those 9 I have gotten the most kills\n\nYour playing Yi and are surprised you have the most kills or damage?\n\nAlso lol, mathmaking.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-09-20T14:36:07.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How the fuck do you make Maths?","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-09-20T13:40:32.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're playing yi, a champion who has very little early game pressure and is generally only good at counterganking or cleaning up opportunistically. If youre in a game where your team isn't feeding, despite the enemy having a ganking jungler, then THAT'S an unevenly matched game. In any evenly matched game, the guy with the jungle pressure on his side will be the one winning, and especially in lower ratings where people don't know how to play when behind, they will likely start feeding after they've gotten to a small deficit. The tradeoff for a good lategame is that you are disadvantaging your team early. If you're not confident in your ability to make up for that start playing a champ who has a bigger impact early, BEFORE your team starts feeding. And if you're dying 10-15 times nearly every game, I'd wager your not as good as you seem to think. You're not going to carry many games if you're spending 5-10 minutes of game time dead.","replies":[]}]}
