We did plant shrooms and Maokais minions, but to no avail since no one actually came into the bush, yet we still smashed the enemy. Last game, the tides were turned and we got smashed.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t play nowhere near as many games as I used to, but seeing how bad the games I have played are, makes me wonder what is going on? Are players leaving and MM can&#039;t keep up? Are Riot making changes that just aren&#039;t working?\r\n\r\nI know Riot made the major dynamic queue change this patch, and that basically ruined ranked and to a lesser degree normals, but it just seems to be getting worse and almost no longer fun.  Over 5 years I have been here and not once have I seen this game drop so low.\r\n\r\nIs it just me, or are other players starting to no longer find enjoyment in this game?","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-08-15T12:16:34.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"all good things come to an end","replies":[]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-08-15T12:07:05.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"100% couldn't agree more.
