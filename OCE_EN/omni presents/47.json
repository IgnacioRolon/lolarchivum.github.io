My last win was a 5v4 game, that is not fun considering my team didn&#039;t want to listen or group and we almost lost.\r\n\r\nWhere has the teamwork gone? What has happened to this game?

I know I am the only common denominator in my games, that still doesn't make it my fault.\n\nI have my bad games, I always start well with a good attitude and never say anything bad unless someone else does, or if my patience wears thin mostly from my team just never listening. That always makes me angry when I try and try and try to be nice and get some team work going but nothing happens.\n\nOne of my recent games my 'team mate' started giving shit for no reason in champion select, I initially let it go for like 5 minutes of game time, but than I started defending my team, I coped it not only from him for the rest of the game, but also in after game chat. At least my team didn't get any more shit after that.\n\nI always say, I don't care for the win or the lose, I never really have and never will. What I care about is 5 players who give their best, don't get nasty at each other and not to make any excuses.\n\nThose 4 could have said sorry that they had bad internet and left it at that. But with one of them constantly DC'd and two of them just flat out complaining, that is not on. I say Trist played well, not because she actually played well, but she didn't complain or make excuses, she just tried her best, and that I honoured her for.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-13T15:51:22.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I fell you for me its more like 3 man team they all called there roles before im matched theme and my mate get stuck with adc and sup as have a shit time as we are bad lol most of the time in a game there are 4 good players and 6 bad ones in a game the bad ones say they have bad wifi and shit but in the end your still just bad","replies":[]}]}
