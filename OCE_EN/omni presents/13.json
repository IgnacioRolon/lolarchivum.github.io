Once upon a time I did make it past Gold, now I am lucky to not be dropped out of Silver 5. Even last season with some 20 games played I made it into Silver, this season with 146 games I am on 15 LP in Silver 5.\r\n\r\nI come here trying to tell everyone how bad it is for the Solo, or minimal premade teams, yet players don&#039;t want to listen, why? The only major change this season is the dynamic queue, everything else is quite the same other than the extra number of small premade teams who can&#039;t play.\r\n\r\nMatchmaking hasn&#039;t changed, there should be no reason from one season to the next that the game is this impossible for a solo player to gain any rank. I will say again, PLATINUM players are having issues getting out of Bronze.\r\n\r\nI haven&#039;t changed how I play and it has always worked in the past, why now does my play style and skill level all of a sudden determine that I am no better than Bronze after 5 years?","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-06-23T06:54:07.371+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What account were you gold on?

His videos on DQ in general are a great watch.

They made this dynamic queue change based on the top <1% of players. \n\nThere are 1.6 million NA players, another issue in itself that there are only 200K OCE players, making our match ups that much worse. 3 million worldwide, this means they are listening to only 30K players AT MOST in making this decision, that is nowhere near enough of a capture in making their decisions for 100% of the player base.\n\nJust think about it, I had no issues in previous seasons, I won some, I lost some, I had team mates AT MY SKILL LEVEL more often than not. Now thanks to 30,000 out of 3,000,000 players, my life got turned upside down. Instead of making a change that affects 2,700,000 players, change how Diamond and above works and leave the rest, or change how Platinum and below work to suit the majority of players.\n\nTwo different match making rules dependant on your rank, it can work.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-06-23T06:27:01.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol im plat 2 and smurf in bronze/silver all the time.

Therefore most people in bronze are mostly around the same skill level.\n\nIn contrast, you going into bronze with higher level mechanics and most of the time better game knowledge, of course it'll be an easy win. Does that mean for bronze players it is easy to get out of bronze? No. Does it mean bronze players are bad? Yes.\n\nIf these players (not you) are truly platinum level then they will be platinum. If they can't get out of bronze, it is not the fault of dynamic queue. Maybe they are better individual players than bronze players, but if they aren't premade with a team then they lose so much strength.\n\nLeague is a team game, and always will be as far as I am concerned. That is exactly why SKT doesn't win every worlds. By far they are the best team there, and Faker is pretty much the grandmaster of league, but team plays can easily overcome this, especially situational ones in games.\n\nIf league was 1v1, Faker would probably be off and on top of the ladder. Same with other highly regarded professionals.\n\nPeople need to realize that dynamic queue didn't create the problem of matching good \"teams\" with good \"solo\" queuers. It merely organized premades. Before dynamic queue, there was still a good number of teams that cursed, or just had really good coordination giving them an edge.\n\nPlayers who do not utilize dynamic queue but then complain about \"unfair\" team matches, are good solo players, but they just aren't good team players. And this isn't Riot's fault. It's theirs.\n\nSidenote:\n\nNone of the above argument was directed at you. \n\nYou shouldn't be smurfing in bronze or silver because if you are Plat 2, then you aren't improving down here. You could easily get Diamond and higher if you worked at it. So go for gold! Err... I mean go for diamond.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-06-23T08:44:24.582+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bless up.

It's because of this that when you need to rely on your jg to gank in order to get ahead or you really need that drag buff but your team isn't responding, people just tilt and lose. I see the reason for dynamic queue with Riot trying to encourage more premades and less soloing because it well and truly doesn't work out most of time with the basis of the game. When your playing League by yourself you feel like you truly are \"stuck behind a screen\" playing with these \"virtual teammates\" whereas when your actually engaging with the people your playing with you really do feel like your all together as a team.","replies":[{"poster":"Grymmstrike","date":"2016-06-24T19:20:27.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They can't have DQ without solos though.  So what you are saying is false.  They are trying to cater to the SMALL portion of people who cried about not being able to rank queue with their friends, while knowing full well and REQUIRING that people play solo in order to get their DQ to work.  If there were no solo players the DQ would not work.  Riot knows that.  They are also very aware that playing solo in the DQ environment is unfair.  Whether they do something to fix that or not is the thing that remains to be seen, although their introduction of a shitty banner for solo players is kind of a sign that although they know the problem exists they don't understand it.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-06-28T12:50:26.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is an easy fix, if they bother to listen to the community. I don't know why they don't listen. All they want to do is cater to the top tier players, as in, the top 1% or less.\n\nImplement a system that allows players to have a personal scoring system. Not only will this allow those who actually know how to play but lose to gain a positive LP, it stops those who are being carried to a certain point and ruining the game from getting there.\n\nI.E. If a Silver player is carried to Diamond, but at best is a Gold level player, he will suck ass at Diamond and end up killing the game for those at that level. On the flip side, if you are actually a Gold level player but are stuck with those in Silver due to being solo, you can at least get some LP in the lost games and climb to your actual rank.\n\nYou don't always drop rank when you lose on zero LP is also another major issue, those who are carried can stay at that level forever as long as they win at least one game before the demotion takes place and just keep ruining the game for those around them due to being carried.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-06-28T12:46:44.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Riot want to keep pushing the Dynamic queue they can at least implement an in-game chat system to allow us to feel like we are actually all human and working together.\n\nCurrently you are spot on, you feel like, nothing.
