That means if you are counting your hits, even if you kill someone, previously you could rely on that second hit to still proc and get that extra tick, great for jungling, now not so great, you lose an extra hit and all that timing I had drilled into my head is out.\n\nMy energise was stuck at 100, forever, the whole time it hit 100 until I finished the game. I brought Shiv on top of that and nothing happened, I had 2 items that basically had no passive.\n\nMy ward count was continuing to climb, first it went 3/6 wards placed, eventually went to 3/9, 3/12 and so on. I don&#039;t know if intentional, but it did give me a somewhat counter of how many I had placed all game.\n\nAnd no PD? No indication of why this item is already disabled.\n\nOn top of these bugs, why do the minions have THAT much pushing power? I played a game against 1 bot to test Yi jungle, got all 6 first towers and 2 inhibitors only, took next 2 towers without even hitting them with roughly 2 waves each lane, by the time I hit B my minions started hitting the nexus, before I had recalled, I had won. That is a shit ton of pushing power for minions alone.\n\nThat is all for now.","replies":[]}
