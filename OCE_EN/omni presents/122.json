How can you go wrong with it?\r\n\r\nI am seeing soo many AFK lately that I have gotten used to it, Rito you need to do something, you cannot let AFK be the norm like it is becoming. How can players get used to having an AFK like it is part of the game?\r\n\r\nIn at least my last 10 games I have had 1 AFK or more somewhere on the map at some point in the game. I even got the worst not too long ago, a 1v5 game.\r\n\r\nWhat part of any of this is fair for anyone?","replies":[{"poster":"Truegolddigger","date":"2016-01-03T07:35:17.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, AFK is so OP right now.\nPassive - Getting a burger brb.\n\nQ - Leaves the match.\nW - Causes everyone to complain about 4v5.\nE - Causes everyone in the game to rage.\nR - Comes back to the game when everyone is lvl 18 and then flames because the burger didn't have enough cheese. And also because the team is going to lose.\n\nThe combo is Q-W-E-R. However, AFK's unique ultimate only comes 45 minutes into the game.\n\nSorry, had to do it.\n\nFor real though, players going AFK is an annoying issue that seems to be getting worse.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-01-03T09:01:55.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got three in my last game with one of them coming back, not buying and just starting to feed, and it seems the other team is getting none.
