They took 2 towers to 6 and a score of 19 - 36.\r\n\r\nI know Silver means not much and in Normals means nothing for matchmaking, yet I see a fair few Silver ranked players who play the way they talk, like rubbish, shit talking everyone and playing just as bad.\r\n\r\nBronze players are just terrible, Silver players are terrible and talk big. To be a Silver 4 and play that badly, is it too easy to get rank at the early stages of ranking? When does the ranks actually show when you are decent? And does rank change normal Matchmaking in anyway?","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-08-25T22:10:05.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To a silver player, a bronze player looks bad.

There's also people that got to the rank they are by playing one champ or cheese strategy well, and are bronze 5 level if they're playing anything else. i wouldn't read into it much","replies":[{"poster":"Infected Walnut","date":"2015-08-25T22:48:25.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=McRuthless,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=kc0wYflN,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-08-25T22:10:05.173+0000)\n>\n> To a silver player, a bronze player looks bad.
