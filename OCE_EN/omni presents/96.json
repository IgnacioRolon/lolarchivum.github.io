So, for example, we look at Annie mid differently to Annie support. We take a series of performance metrics and compare how you do to all other players in your region in your champion / position combination. It is percentile driven - so earning a high score means you performed in the top x% of players on that champ in that position. The grade itself governs the point gains.\n\n[(Source)](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/features/champion-mastery)\n\n[Basically grades similarly to a bell curve](http://study.com/academy/lesson/bell-curve-definition-impact-on-grades.html)","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-03-29T20:45:58.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah thats not fair at all. i would strongly assume he helped snowball every lane. but its the same as everyone checking the damage done to champions and not caring about any other stat in the post game lobby. those with heavy CC, or just a lulu mid vs jungle yi (on the same team), yi's gonna do more damage and look like he carried the game but realistically if he got fed af, theres a chance the lulu enabled him to go bonkers and snowball earlier on and its hard to identify credit to lulu where its deserved. but meh, as long as someone else got an S and you still get the chest","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-03-30T08:10:44.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeh and a Naut jungle would not have much stats TBH, he is a CC / tanky champ and for him to have as much damage taken as Nasus, that should have been worth much more than a D.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-03-29T12:30:20.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Averages and bell curves apparently.","replies":[]}]}
