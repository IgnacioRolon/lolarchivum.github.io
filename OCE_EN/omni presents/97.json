I will try and keep this short.\r\n\r\n1 - The player scorecard system.\r\n2 - Dynamic queue\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of this game being a team game, either Riot can remove the Solo option of joining queues, or reward those who play solo in the same way they do premades.\r\n\r\nThe scorecard system is, sad to say, retarded in how Riot give out the scores. You are given your score based on your stats compared to all other players in your region on that same champ. Not really fair if you play solo, since players in a premade team generally can have it much easier and therefore gain better stats and a higher score.\r\n\r\nNow with the queue system, as you should be well aware, I am very vocal about this. Since Riot want to push premades this and premades that, either give something to those who don&#039;t join team, or remove the option of letting them play. With every change to the queue system it only pushes those who play solo further away from the game. Not only do premades get more rewards, they also have more say in game and not just the /surrender option, but everything.\r\n\r\n4+1 - Your team has 6 towers and an inhibitor 35 minutes into the game, the enemy team is dead, the 1 says &quot;Let&#039;s Baron.&quot;, the 4 say nah, no point and all go B, 4 minutes later your team is dead. Enemy team goes Baron, gets another team fight win, 30 seconds later have just taken 2 towers and an Inhibitor, the 4 players go an /FF.\r\n\r\nI see it all the time, we get a team kill, have enough health and time to take Baron and B before they respawn, but we don&#039;t and end up not only losing the Baron, but the entire game also because the 4 of them are being dictated by one person who can&#039;t really read the play. I had a game I can never forget. I can&#039;t really remember what I was asking to do, but one of my so called team turned around, told me very impolitely to &quot;Shut the f**k up, we are on Skype and I am in charge.&quot;, after that they simply started ignoring me and letting me die, whenever we were attacked they just ran, EVERY, SINGLE, TIME. Lo and behold, we lost.\r\n\r\nSome players would rather lose the game than listen to someone else, and that is part of the problem, if your team are a major part of the reason you lose, either they refuse to listen to ANYTHING, counter pick themselves, play super aggressive and feed, or anything that helps lose the game, how is that fair that you lose due to someone else?\r\n\r\nEven with the current setup of how the game works, I have had plenty of S rank loses and therefore LP loss. That should not happen.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-06-06T17:52:25.204+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry Riot are screwing themselves hard over the Dynamic Queue shenanigans.\n\nAnd all just to move the casual player base into ranked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-06-07T05:14:06.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 my underpants. \n2 the bulb in the kitchen.","replies":[]}]}
