You can invite other players, you can put your game into the custom queue for others to join and take any of the champions you choose under your circumstances. When you finish the &#039;game&#039;, or decide enough, you should be able to reset the game back to what you chose as the start of the game.\r\n\r\nPut yourself in a situation you need experience in. I get a lot of games the players GG in early when you least expect it, your team is down by a little, still a chance to come back and it&#039;s over. You are behind in the jungle and need a way to come back, whatever it may be, the bots may not be the best, but practice is practice.\r\n\r\nA few years ago I used to think I was half good at this game, but realised I was rubbish, even for normal standards. I remember struggling in bot games if 2-3 players would DC, even with a good player helping me. So I started practicing in games against bots, just me in a custom game against X number of bots and continued to do this until I could take any champion against 5 bots and win.\r\n\r\nNot only would this allow me to play until the very end, I could really get my shots down pat, learn the CD&#039;s back to front, learn to read what lane I was needed in most. Do I push? Do I recall and defend? Should I attack in a 1v2 or 1v3 situation and actually do something enough to ensure that by the time someone respawned we did not lose any towers or inhibitors?\r\n\r\nYou learn a lot from that, think about how many situations you have been in that it was only you left against X number of opponents and they were knocking at your door and you didn&#039;t know what to do, practice makes perfect.","replies":[{"poster":"Smeagi","date":"2015-10-06T13:39:06.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot has already looked at the idea of a sandbox mode but they said they don't really want one in favour of actual matches.
