Comes back, starts complaining with half her chat just **** **** **** stating some shit about tilting and Jax tells her off. She retaliates, so I tell her off, and than I get the lovely &quot;I&#039;ll fucking bash your head in, fight me %%%%&quot;.\r\n\r\nSo I call her out and tell her that threatening messages are not acceptable, so she turns around and says &quot;Chill, it&#039;s just a joke&quot;, abuses me some more and asks to report me. FUCKING LOVE IT! This community has gone down the toilet from what it used to be, I come here to play, not to have players go AFK, start bitching about being behind and than threaten others, I take that VERY serious and do think about making a report about it, you never know who you are going to make a threat to that will take it too far, and not report to Riot either.\r\n\r\nRiot needs to step up their game and start banning players earlier than they do.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-01T12:29:45.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry, even high elo players get away with that sort of abuse.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgDk9yGkI2w\n\nDoesn't matter what you give riot, they don't give a flying fuck.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-07-04T10:14:50.835+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly this cannot be more true, the more I play this game the more I start to not give a fuck also.\n\nJust look at the state of Season 6, Riot made a HUGE change with the dynamic queue based on feedback from the top <1% of players, that was the turning point I stopped caring.\n\nI still come here and _try_ to send the message the Riot done fucked up, but to no avail, there are too many fan boys sucking Riots ass thinking it will get them an easy path in life.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NeverEndingBong","date":"2016-07-02T05:23:20.255+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Play a different game. This is not the game for you. If you can't handle it or type /mute all then you probably shouldn't play. That's just how this community is unfortunately.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-07-04T10:17:58.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh I can handle it, that is not the issue. The point, sadly, that ass holes like yourself cannot seem to fathom in that pea brain of yours, is that it should NEVER happen. Players need to be dealt swift punishment for this type of behaviour, not sit there and say \"It was just a prank bro\" and continue to spout nonsense.\n\nI can mute all, or I can just ignore it, no big deal. I have played 1v1 games here and in other games that actually have 1v1, the shit talk is just that, shit talk, sadly there are players who take it to heart.\n\nWhat I am doing here, not so much as complaining that someone called me bad names, but that Riot needs to pull their fist out of their asses and realise the state this game is in.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ErÃ¸se","date":"2016-07-02T13:14:10.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1.
