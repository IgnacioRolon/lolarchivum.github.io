So intead of finishing with ~650 AP, I should have finished the game closer to 800 AP.\r\n\r\nI thought I was reading it wrong, so I sold it, went back to 285 AP, re-brought it and still only went up to 385 AP.\r\n\r\nSo I tried another game as Kog on Bots, someone who can kill easy to get fast gold and benefit from AP. I got up to 233 AP, with Deathcap it went to 395, so working as intended there with the +162 AP from the item.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if it is AP MF, Poro King or certain items in a certain order that have done it, but dammit, I want my +120 AP!\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-06T02:13:02.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"35% of 285 = 99.75\n\n{{item:1052}} + {{item:1058}} + {{item:1026}} = 120\n\n120 + 99.75 = 219.75, you already had the 3 components, so all you got was the passive amount, thus the 100 ap.
