Her actual quote in champion select, and she is ranked 5 with Vayne, so much for ranks. 3686 damage TOTAL to champions in 20 minutes, that is 184 damage a MINUTE. She had 2 kills and no assists, she was involved in killing TWO champions for the entire game.\r\n\r\nBot lane failed hard, bot lane roamed to mid, I failed, than they grouped and finished us off. I get stuck in these gamed with wannabes who fail miserably and for what? Just so I can get the same shitty loss as them no matter how hard I try.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, for all you ass lickers, I am naming and shaming someone who acted like they were gods gift to the world and failed, bringing down myself and Teemo who were actually doing better than the rest, FFS, a Teemo against a Poppy doing better than 3 of my teammates.\r\n\r\nLow ranked players like to buff and puff and blow themselves down, it&#039;s sad and needs to stop. You need to implement a system, at least at lower ranks that will get those types of players to be grouped with those types of players, something that gets those who don&#039;t play like that out of this shit rank.","replies":[]}
