A full AP Teemo could get free kills just with his shrooms all over the map and a full tank Sion would collapse under pressure.\r\n\r\nNow it has turned a full 180, you can&#039;t play a carry, with all the CC and how tanky you can get, you can&#039;t get more than a couple of hits unless you have a tank who goes first and absorbs the damage, if you get caught, unless you have an escape, forget it, you are dead.\r\n\r\nWill there ever be a time when the better player wins, not just the champion and build?\r\n\r\nI just finished 3 3v3 games, MF &gt; Yi &gt; Nasus. L/L/W. In the Nasus game there was a really decent LB, even with 4-5 combos against me I still managed to walk away with almost half health, all I built was defense and all she built was offense yet I almost killed her time and time again and couldn&#039;t because she is LB and a jumpy little bitch. But my point is that she couldn&#039;t kill me before her mana ran out, so I just advanced in my lane and ignored her and took a good beating before almost killing all 3 of them.\r\n\r\nThat is not fun, not for them, not for me, not for anyone. 3 tanky champions and that is it, you win. And the same goes for Conquest, the tankier you are, the better. What happened to this game and will it ever get better?","replies":[{"poster":"XFlashFireNeelX","date":"2015-05-29T09:26:42.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meanwhile in bronze....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-29T00:36:16.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You haven't been around during the AoE mage dominance...

I don't expect Riot to stop adding champs or items anytime soon so I would say no this game will never be balanced, it's just the nature of games like this they are always changing so the balance is always chaotic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-05-28T11:39:43.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I enjoy playing tanks and making ADC's lives miserable... LOL\n\nWhat do you mean what happened? Tanks used to be the huge thing a few seasons ago. Just because Season 4 was mainly dominated by Assassins mid and Fighters top doesn't mean thats what LoL is supposed to be like. Its a cycle.\n\nMeta is always changing. Riot will give Cinderhulk another nerf in a month or 2 and things will probably change again.","replies":[]}]}
