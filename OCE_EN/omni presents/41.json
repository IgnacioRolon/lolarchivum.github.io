I whooped bot lane hard and helped my team stay in it for 51 minutes.\r\n\r\nYet, Teemo top lane refused to help the team, even going to the extremes of ignoring the minions attacking our base and running down the bot lane for some farm. He actually ran past all the minions attacking our inhibitors and went more than half way in the bot lane to get more CS.\r\n\r\nHe was good as Teemo, got the most kills, but simply never joined the team until he couldn&#039;t safely get out of our base.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t give a fuck how good you are %%%%faces, you must join your team. Playing in a 4v5 game is a nightmare when there are actually 5 players on each team. Another game lost because I tried to handle a game when only 4 of us were willing to assist each other.","replies":[{"poster":"ArcticHorizon","date":"2015-09-20T03:39:58.379+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plot twist.
