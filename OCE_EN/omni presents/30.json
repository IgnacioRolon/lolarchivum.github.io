I have my reasons.\n\nI have had plenty of games where I get A or S rank and a lose, that is not fair that I have a great game and get bad team mates who lose the game for the team.\n\nThere are those games when you get premades on your team and all they do is complain about the non premades, than play terrible and lose.\n\nThere are the AFK and DC players who make it that much harder for everyone else.\n\nThere are those surprise 20 minute GG for no reason, even if your team is not losing, than you realise all 4 of your team were premade and just can&#039;t be bothered trying because the game has not already been won. Or they are trying a new comp and want to try something else, so they just GG.\n\nThan there are those reallllyyyy close games that could have gone either way and you feel ripped of by some shit that made you lose, you get your S rank and for what? Nothing because once you hit rank 5 that ranking system is pointless.\n\nI have Master Yi on 41K champion points, that is 21K higher than rank 5 and for what? The only time those points mean anything is when someone goes and checks your profile, after the game is over. They need to mean something other than rank. Anyone can farm a champion and get the rank up, it doesn&#039;t actually mean you are good with them.\n\nI mean come on, I have Teemo at Rank 4 and he is useless outside laning phase in most games. Those after game scores should show how good you are, change you rank, your MMR, give your profile a score instead of a simple win or lose, there are too many variables in a team game to use a 1v1 scoring metric.\n\nAfter all, don&#039;t those ranks show how you played based on ALL your stats AND a comparison against everyone else in your region in that same role with that same champion, possibly with that same matchup? That will be perfect, you get scored and given a profile score based on how YOU play with your team and against the enemy compared to everyone else on the server, not just &quot;Hey you lost, not your fault, but too bad&quot;.\n\nI had a really good game recently, got tons of CS, damage and all that, but a few too high deaths, yet the rank was something like C. I have had games I thought were worse than that and gotten a higher score. That is due to the champion I was playing was not up to scratch with what everyone else could do on the same server.\n\nThere are also those games where I play really bad, die a lot, get shit stats, low kills and what? I get a D rank and a win I did not deserve.","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2015-09-26T04:33:59.029+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You play master Yi and Teemo, and you're calling for players to be ranked by performance ie. KDA\n\nI'm 100% certain you might have some decent individual skill but abysmal team focus. It's a team game. Learn to play as a part of a team. \n\nWith your system, everyone would be gagging to steal each others kills. Gone would be the days where braum would put himself between his adc and the enemy jinx ult. Gone would be the days where Leona would dive the tower to secure a double kill for her adc. \n\n'You want wards? Nah mate buy them yourself. I gotta put my money on defensive stats so I don't die.

After all she did help her ADC or someone on her team get 15 kills.\n\nThat means rather than her getting all the kills, someone who can actually carry the team late will get the kills, the gold, the items and be of more use to the team.\n\nAssists on a support champion are worth more than kills, regardless of the deaths, the 15 assists is better.

These grades are awarded based on your overall performance in the role, the champion you're playing and, crucially, where you're playing them.

We take a series of performance metrics and compare how you did to all other players in your region in that specific champion/position combination.\n\nThis is percentile-driven; earning a high score means you performed in the top x% of players in that champion/position combination.\n\nThat above is from Riot, they can detect how well you played compared to everyone else in your role and lane and champion and whatever. Whilst the game cannot recognise everything, there are ways to recognise some stuff that won't be implemented, like the flash > eat an ult scenario, the amount of times I have flashed and eaten an ult in error.\n\nBut non the less, the game can compare you with someone else in your same position and that should be used to an advantage of players.
