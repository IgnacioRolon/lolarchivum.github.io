They somehow believe that an enemy Teemo will win the game and yet when you pick him, you get flamed for doing so.\r\n\r\nLast game I got given the AD role as last pick, so I took my best AD in Teemo, the hate started straight away and I was asked to leave for trolling, not in a nice way either. Yet I finished the game with the second overall damage and most kills with only 9 deaths being quite good for a champion with no escape.\r\n\r\nI love proving to everyone that Teemo is a good champ, yet if players hate him so much and see him as just a troll pick, they generally do not like to help you much and therefore you suffer the consequences.\r\n\r\nLast night I got Teemo in top lane against Darius, ONE person said it would work, the other 3 didn&#039;t believe that I had any chance. Not only did I beat Darius comprehensively, I also forced their mid and jungle to gank me quite often with no counter ganks of my own, not much my jungle could do when Darius was always pushed over half way.\r\n\r\nI learnt to play in all lanes with Teemo before the champion mastery levels was introduced and generally always do well, with or without ganks or assistance, yet it infuriates me to no end that even just the name makes players start to rage. Are people really that bad at him that they just don&#039;t like the thought of someone who has no real escape or initiation, or burst damage, CC, nothing really, that they must force their hate for him onto everyone else and generally not help?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-07T14:59:31.069+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"If you pick teemo, you are an asshole.\n\nPlain and simple.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-09-08T13:45:27.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See that is the attitude this game does not need, that is the problem, players like you being an asshole for no reason.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-08T14:43:16.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are picking the devil, don't expect sympathy.\n\nHell i mained FF jungle teemo, you have to embrace the hate.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Plasmarine","date":"2015-09-07T16:22:03.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I couldn't agree more...\nThe game is **NEVER** lost just because someone has picked an odd champion for a specific role that doesn't fit in the meta.\nWhen the rest of the team however flames them and then chooses not to help or assist them at all throughout the game because of that, **THAT'S** when the game is lost.\n\nGet yo s**t together OCE!","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-09-08T03:25:52.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So ur saying (to dumb down for the people who wont read all this sh*t)\nIt doesn't matter if another person chooses Teemo / Singed or Twitch, they're only OP if you feed them.","replies":[{"poster":"Plasmarine","date":"2015-09-08T11:54:19.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh no, (well that's pretty true too lol) I just meant if your team members ever go off at you and flat out says like \"not ganking bot, troll lane\"  or \"stupid ass champ can handle himself\" and walks away from fights that you're in when they damn well could of saved you then it's much worse than whatever the reason is they're hating on you lol","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-09-08T13:44:06.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ONLY when the person with that odd pick can actually play, or gets the help they need and not the hate they don't deserve.\n\nIt is sad as fuck to see players being %%%%s and refusing to help because you didn't pick what the top ranked players are picking and building like they are.","replies":[{"poster":"Plasmarine","date":"2015-09-08T14:48:04.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-09-07T23:46:19.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"twitch jung is pretty horrible though. if you want stealth and safety just go evelynn shaco or khazix. if i ever saw a twitch jung i dont care what role im playing im going to your starting camp and harassing the fuck out of you lol. if i wasnt support i could definitely kill you hahaha lezbihonest","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-09-08T13:45:51.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's not be honest and stop being mean for no reason.
