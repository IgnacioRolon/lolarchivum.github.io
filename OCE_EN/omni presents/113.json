That is the only reason I can see as to why this game has gone so quickly downhill.\r\n\r\nI have never seen so many premades before, 9/10 of my games there is now a premade, and it gets as bad as last game when they ALL ignored me and all spoke in their own language. I&#039;m not against their language, but it goes blatantly against the so called TEAMWORK part of the game.\r\n\r\nGame in and game out I see premades being, dare I say it, c*nts. They can&#039;t play, simple. They may have some luck as the champion they are playing when it comes to the first 10 minutes of the game, in lane, but that is it. They don&#039;t give 2 shits about any other lane, or any other player aside from their friends.\r\n\r\nYou plan did not work and needs to be stopped ASAP.\r\n\r\nIn my last game I had FOUR enemy players at times in my lane, I got ONE person, once helping me in lane before it was too late. I even had the enemy support, jungle and mid all show up together, no pings, no warnings, nothing. A Blitz, Lee, Akali and Yasuo all at the same time, nothing I could do, even under my tower. I try and run, they have 3 who can chase faster than I can run.","replies":[{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-03-11T18:09:45.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uh.. Are you solo que?\n\nThe possibility of you getting matched in a game with 4 people who are in group is much smaller a chance than you think. I play a 4 man group a lot and the time it takes to find a game compared to solo or duo is insane. Like 10-20 minutes longer at times. \n\nAlso you say you get it all the time? Well the chances of  you getting it is close to 1-5% chance. So unless you play thousands of games i find it bull crap you are getting them constantly.. \n\nAlso the whole language thing, i think over the 500+ ranked games this season alone i have put in (yes i am a no lifer atm in between jobs) i have only ever 2 times had a language barrier with either team or a player.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-03-13T03:36:14.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"90% of my games have a premade in some way, you can generally tell, or just check after the game to see who has been playing with who regularly.

And it is quite pointless at times focusing on your own game when you do get premades who are obviously not doing the right thing, you can only carry so much.","replies":[]}]}]}
