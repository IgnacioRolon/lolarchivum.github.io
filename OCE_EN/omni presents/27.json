Change the values to whatever you want, but look at _**Score 2**_, that will give you what I think should be the +/- LP gains based on your own stats. I entered some random game of mine, I was Garen in a normal match and spent most of the game in top lane on my own, no need to roam since Varus was a wrecking ball, and I deserved the minus score, I did jack shit to help my team.\r\n\r\nGive Bard 4 more assists and what happens? He gets a comparable score to Udyr and Varus, he is after all, a support. But what can you do, Varus wrecked face and didn&#039;t need help, therefore since he played that much better than everyone else, he deserves the best score. It also shows that yes, on the losing team you can gain LP and if you play well enough, even on the support, you can minimise your loses.\r\n\r\nAnd if you think this is not fair and maybe you should put Towers and Inhibitors to help those who backdoor, what about that Nasus who comes in and does a 1K Q to steal the tower, or the minion who takes your tower? If you back door, your Damage Dealt should be higher, and therefore noticeable in your score.\r\n\r\nFYI - I personally, and have seen other players state, that it is unfair to get players who suck ass, or in this case simply do not help for whatever reason, and you get the same shitty LP gain or lose as them. If that was a ranked game I would have put more effort to help my team, but if those were my stats, based on how I played, I would accept the -LP since I played like shit.\r\n\r\nI am not here just complaining that when I play well I want LP gain because I didn&#039;t deserve the lose, I deserved the -LP score in a winning team. Look at the enemy Vayne and Blitz, they done more to help their team based on stats and in game, I will admit they played better than me that game, but they got a loss due to some of their team sucking ass, that is just not fair.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-04-14T00:48:26.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIP Proxy singed mains.\n\nFact is sometimes having a negative KDA can actually help your team.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-04-14T03:11:48.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Maybe, maybe not. What I tried to do is show that helping your team will improve your end score, regardless if you win or not, you are at least trying to do the right thing. Because even if the game is over, regardless of the result, you still should be trying to help your team.\n\nIf you are the type of player who gives up when your team start feeding, or the one who starts fucking around when you know you are going to win, you are not doing what is right and helping your team, therefore you should suffer and not gain as much LP as you should, or in some games, lose LP.\n\nAs for the negative KDA, yeh it could help your team, could. Let's say you were trying to build tank, trying is the optimal word here. What happens if you charge in first, try to disrupt the enemy and absorb some damage but you are not tanky enough, or building wrong? You will simply die, you won't absorb much damage, you won't get much assists, you will be a useless sack of shit.\n\nTherefore your stats will show a negative KDA, not much damage done, not much damage taken, not many assists and therefore anyone who knows how to read the stats will see that you were in fact useless and should lose LP regardless of the end game results.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-04-14T05:50:53.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please keep showing how stupid you are it's so useful to your point.\n\nSeen as you've clearly never seen/heard what i'm talking about i will explain.\n\nhttp://st.elohell.net/public/chill/12f89d601cd59ee3972ac37dce223481.png\n\nThis is some of the scores that a regular proxy singed player will get, yet they win quite often (assuming they are good) why is this?\n\nBecause in each of their deaths they have 2-4 people chasing them while their team is off getting objectives and winning the game, so sure their score looks like ass, but they have contributed to the win rather majorly.\n\nWith your system, the aim of the game changes from trying to win, to trying to pad your KDA regardless of wins/losses.\n\nI can go 20/0 and be no help to my team and directly cause a loss, or i can go 10/3/10 and cause my team to win, but sadly the thing that gets me the most LP is to go 20/0 and lose the game.\n\nOh but now the retards who go and lose the game by only securing kills can feel good and climb to places they don't actually deserve to be.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-14T07:47:19.377+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is exactly the problem with ranked being based on an individual score, and I agree with you 100%. Though I'd say there are nicer ways to say it.\n\nIndividual scoring does exist, that's what the mastery ratings are, but League is a TEAM game, so rank is based off of how well you can perform in a TEAM. The game is about killing the nexus, however you go about doing that not about having a good KDA. If you want to win games then everything you do has to have the end goal of taking objectives and pushing the nexus.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-04-14T11:35:54.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Since you completely mis-understand what I am trying to say, as you always do, and can only post me a screenshot from 3 years ago, I have no other stats to work on, therefore I cannot counter argue what you are showing me.\n\nSo I decided to try and find a Singed game, and the first one I came across from only 20 hours ago, taking into account the THREE YEAR difference, the stats will be vastly different for 2 reasons. 1. The player is a different player and 2. How the game is played has changed vastly over 3 years time, if anyone these days is found to be chasing a Singed, and not able to catch them, they are playing wrong and deserve the lose. So, here goes nothing.\n\nThe first game I found had a score of 1/3/7 (win), and according to my calculations had a +9 LP, second highest on the map.\nThe second game I found was 1/1/5 (win), +8 LP, highest in the game.\nThe third game 8/5/14 (loss), +6 LP, an average gain in a lost game. But a gain.\n5/6/5 (loss), -4, the first loss so far I have came across, but it was also a lost game.\n\nOut of all the games I have found, none look similar to what you posted and considering they are from 3 years ago, it seems like no one even plays like this anymore. If you can post me an actual game, not just a screenshot, I can give you some more input on what I am trying to say since you never really understand my point, or anyone's point, you always need to be right no matter what.\n\nI still remember the day I was warned about you and how you ALWAYS have to say there is nothing wrong and are always right.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2016-04-13T22:29:02.314+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The objective of the game is to win. There are so many factors which affect your ability to win games, many of which cannot be easily quantified. For example\n\n-The effect you have on your teammates. The stuff you say/do in game can make your teammates play better or worse than they normally would. If your team is consistently worse than the other team, its probably because YOU are making them play worse than average\n-Your champion picks. Picking champs that are easy to win lane with but poor in the mid-lategame, susceptible to ganks, or do not fit well into your teamcomp/against the enemy teamcomp can set you up to lose right from champ select, even if you 'play well' or 'win lane', and make you falsely believe that it must've been your bad teammates that caused you to lose.\n-Clutch decisions in the mid-late game. Some people are good at getting fed but will frequently make poor decisions in the lategame, causing them to lose winnable games while not having much of a negative effect on their score( e.g. being in the wrong place on the map and giving up free inhibs or barons, getting caught out at crucial moments etc.). On the flip side, some people don't look to be playing that great but consistently make good decisions later in the game and cause their team to win most of the close games.\n\nNo matter how good you THINK you are playing, or how much better you THINK you are, if you are not winning more games than you lose in the long run, you are not actually better than the people you are playing with.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-04-14T01:49:48.897+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great answer! \n\nI'm also just going to link the[ Riot official stance](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide#q2) on basing ranked climbing on individual player \"skill\" (I say skill, but I mean in-game stats).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-04-14T02:59:20.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Let's have a look at my last game shall we. If I had cause for concern and a real reason for trying, I would have, but since all I was going to really gain out of my last game was a win or a loss, I decided to go top with Malzahar for shits and giggles.\n\nThe game was over by about the 11 minute mark when bot lane had given away SEVEN KILLS to the ADC and a tower to boot. I had died ONCE top lane in that time with the enemy jungler ganking my lane.\n\nBy the 17 minute mark I had died three times, still kept my top tower in tact, yet mid and bot had both lost their inhibitor. 20 minutes in, we had only 2 towers and an inhibitor left in top lane. Now at this point you are thinking, what am I doing? Am I roaming to help my team? Am I stopping Malphite roaming? Well, no and no. i didn't roam or do anything useful to try and stop Malphite, I didn't need to, Malphite was never leaving his lane either. Remembering, at 11 minutes their ADC had 7 kills, I died once.\n\nOverall, it was basically a 4v4 game between mid and bot and they fucked up hard. Again if I had a reason for trying I would have, but 11 minutes in it was game over, I had no reason to try, I was going to lose the game anyway, I was heading for the same LP loss as the rest of my team, I may as well play like the rest of my team and lose some MMR to make my next game a little easier.","replies":[]}]}]}
