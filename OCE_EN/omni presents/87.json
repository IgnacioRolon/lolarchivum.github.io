Like the Annie support and MF Mid or Vayne top. Selections in roles that make zero sense, ones that can be easily stopped or countered.\r\n\r\nI thought to try Ranked, so far no issues with who gets what, but more so who picks what. 4th game in and I get an Annie support who says she is a good Annie... to which our Jinx is complaining about some 5 minutes in, which Annie than states she is new to Ranked.\r\n\r\nShe doesn&#039;t feed, she just doesn&#039;t do anything and I did say at the start I have had Annie supports who were useless. She obviously said she was good, but failed anyway.\r\n\r\nNow, a decent or better player will now what champions to use in what lanes until it comes to high level play, with those players who can actually take Vayne top lane and do something early against lets say a Garen and than play safe to help the team win.\r\n\r\nThat is if the rest of the team picks correctly. I had a normal game first tonight before going Ranked as MF top, bot lane duo went Ali and Blitz and fed, against a Garen top, I fed. It was a stupid decision, but one I had to make since we had no ranged, I knew it wasn&#039;t going to work, but what choice did I have, go 4 melee? It probably would have worked better.\r\n\r\nBut back onto ranked, something should be done to stop players firstly bickering about who goes where. In one of the games I had someone said X and X are going duo lane, one of those was last pick, thankfully the rest of the team let them go there.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know how this would work, and maybe it would only work at low level ranked, but first have a system that lets first pick actually select a lane they want, some sort of option and this filters down the list, thus allowing them as first pick to actually get what lane they want.\r\n\r\nNow is the hard part, what is everyone&#039;s thoughts on forcing players to choose from a specific list of champions per lane? Again something for low level ranked. It may be something that actually gives stability and helps get players out of the ranked dumps and feel like they are doing something good.\r\n\r\nMost of us know there is a set amount of champions you can actually play per lane that actually works. For example, a Vayne Vs a Garen top lane is pointless unless the Vayne is very good, the Garen will just win. Or a duo bot lane melee or support or something stupid just does not work in most cases.\r\n\r\nIf you want to try a dumb combination or champion in a lane that usually is not done, please try it in normals.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-08-29T15:25:27.833+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">what is everyone's thoughts on forcing players to choose from a specific list of champions per lane?\n\nLeave league of legends, now, no one here want's your meta enforcing horse shit.\n\nSome players are bad, but they will be bad meta or not, you enforcing meta just makes you look like a twat.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-08-29T16:52:21.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=BNEOb40J,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-08-29T15:25:27.833+0000)\n>\n> Leave league of legends, now, no one here want's your meta enforcing horse shit.\n> \n> Some players are bad, but they will be bad meta or not, you enforcing meta just makes you look like a twat.\n\nThan you tell me what to do, telling me to leave is as pointless as my suggestion.\n\nSo far I have gathered that the skill level in Normals is better than Ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-08-30T11:42:29.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well what rank are you?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
