Every other log I put there tells me I had a good network, no lost packets, no ping spikes.\n\nIn that game even Diana was DC at times, so it wasn't just me. I have never experienced this before.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-02-01T08:06:00.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks.  \n\nIt is helpful to see because it shows what _kind_ of issue was occuring.   The strong red bars mean that you were seeing packet loss at those times.  It means your game traffic is being interrupted somewhere in between the game server and your PC (or even within your PC.  Ideally you never want to see that.\n\nThere are potentially many causes, but from the log it looks like a network link was briefly overloaded or failed.  It could be anything from a home router to a backbone link from your ISP to Riot.  I checked if there was anything strange going on with our servers at that time, but there wasn't any sign of issues .  Based on that, I'd suspect it is somewhere within your ISP or the connection from them to Riot.\n\nIt would be interesting to see if the Diana's logs show issues at the same time within the game.  Are you and Diana on the same ISP?\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-02-01T08:46:14.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately Diana and I do not know each other, we both just complained about DCing at the time this occurred.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2016-01-31T09:24:27.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Talk shit about league and they fuck with your client, seriously.","replies":[]}]}
