On TT I was having minion waves follow me, with my poison on, and it done nothing, actually NOTHING. Not just a little bit of damage, but wasn&#039;t even ticking on the enemies.\n\nPlus when using my E, right next to the enemy almost on top of them, he decided to run around from the side of the enemy to the top of the enemy before his E decided to work, more than once too, like he was having pathing issues trying to get through a minion wave when there were no minions around.\n\nEverything Riot is doing these days is just adding to the frustration of trying to play and slowly killing the game.\n\nHonestly, the game is now what 10 years old, we know that since Riot gave us some reward for hitting 10 years, but a game that STILL runs with the same coding after this long will inevitably start having small issues that just make it frustrating to play.\n\nAnd I am not joking about Singed&#039;s spells, my Q was COVERING the enemy minions and not even ticking over. I decided to play him on TT to see how he goes, and he doesn&#039;t anymore.\n\nI am going to stick around until the start of S7 and if the game is still going down the drain, I am done. that will be some 6 years, 5 of which I did actually support this game and give Riot credit where it is due, since the start of S6 everything they do is just making the game worse for wear.","replies":[{"poster":"Belrick","date":"2016-10-01T00:51:57.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dota2 is doing better than lol and this new style of fps / moba seems to be the future of the genre","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlitzForever","date":"2016-09-29T16:21:02.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"As a singed main for 5 years I can confirm damage \"feels\" alot less.","replies":[]}]}
