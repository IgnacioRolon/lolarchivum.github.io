There is absolutely no incentive to play ranked anymore, you get a good game, a good win and nothing. The minute &#039;your&#039; lane opponent gets fed, regardless of how, it is all your fault. Nothing to say about the people who died to them, or the fact I get camped by 3-4 at times.\r\n\r\n_**And it was no wonder it was my fault, the players who were blaming me were all premade. &quot;Oh no, my friend is feeding, better blame someone else.&quot;**_ And to top it off, I even knew the loss was coming, one of the premades told us to slow down our champ select as he &quot;Wanted to pull some cones&quot;, I had a stoner on my team.\r\n\r\nIt is seriously off putting to play ranked when you get stuck with premades who feed, than blame the other players. And trying to get your lane choice in normals is like playing roulette. Where is the incentive to play ranked, let alone try to win, when I get are premades who are super abusive, even when it is their own friends who playing bad they still abuse you? Even the ones who play terrible and feed hard yell and scream it is not their fault.\r\n\r\nIt goes a little something like this:\r\n_You didn&#039;t camp top lane and forced my friend to rage quit, your fault.\r\nMy friends are feeding, your fault.\r\nYou didn&#039;t gank when I asked you to and I didn&#039;t get the kill, your fault.\r\nOMG I am getting camped, but the jungler is premade with me, still your fault._\r\n\r\nRiot has put so much emphasise on premade teams that when they group, not only does the MM put them into a higher MMR than they actually are, they just abuse whoever is not on the premade regardless of ANYTHING and right now, I have no real reason to bother playing if all I am going to do is get grouped with them, lose the game because they fed early, lost early towers, and will only blame me.\r\n\r\nPlease Riot, give us some incentive to bother trying to play when players will abuse you, not help you, lay blame on anyone other than their friends and basically make your gaming experience a shit one.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-05-30T12:38:08.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yep.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-05-30T13:41:24.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"My very next ranked game, I get Nasus as first pick overall, enemy takes Panth. I remember some 6 minutes in I stated \"Panth is going to fuck me over\". I B back to base, Panth TP to bot lane, 8 minutes into the game bot lane tower was gone. I remember stating \"That's it, it's game over\", nope, Lee didn't listen and started abusing me. Even though at that point I had NO DEATHS and was going par still with Panth until Ashe came top lane and ruined my day.\n\n34 minutes later, we had taken, correction, I had taken both of our only tower kills and we got SMASHED!\n\nFUCK! THIS! GAME!\n\nEven when I get countered hard, I STILL played better than my bot lane, still get more CS, more towers (well technically none since my minions took last hit on both of them) and more kills. Looking at my stats I took most damage and dealt second most damage, more than our mid and bot lane. Yet NOOOOO, Lee had to squarely lay the blame on me just because I told him we would lose.\n\nNow I didn't stop trying, I kept regrouping when I could, farmed when there were no enemies around and generally tried my best. But this makes my point more valid, EIGHT MINUTES INTO THE GAME BOT LANE HAD LOSE THEIR TOWER, Ashe came top lane and took that tower, where the fuck is my incentive to keep trying after that point? There is none, not at all. I tried my best, but I knew that losing a tower that fast and being hard countered in my own lane, we could never win.\n\nAGAIN, yet again, another time I called it, my bot lane failed hard. I have lost almost ALL of my games due to bot lane being rubbish and AGAIN I knew I should have dodged. 2 seconds into selection bot lane asks \"Can I go top?\". He obviously chose bot just because he could get into the game faster and didn't want to play it.\n\nYet again I get into a game I knew from team select I would lose, yet again I called it in game before the shit hit the fan, yet again I was right the entire time, but I still tried my best and for what? NOTHING! Actually, wrong, I lost some LP, again.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-05-31T02:44:53.473+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Omni Presents,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=j2AfgBVE,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-05-30T13:41:24.384+0000)\n>\n> I remember some 6 minutes in I stated &quot;Panth is going to fuck me over&quot;.\n\nWhy?\n\n>  I remember stating &quot;That&#x27;s it, it&#x27;s game over&quot;, \n\nWhy?\n\n> where the fuck is my incentive to keep trying after that point?\n\nJust do it.\n\n> and AGAIN I knew I should have dodged.\n\nJust do it.\n\n> , yet again I called it in game before the shit hit the fan,\n\nWhy?","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-06-01T04:32:33.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why why why? Because I said so and I was right. I know when a game is going to be good or not and once it starts I know which way it will go most of the time before the 10 minute mark, I have not yet been wrong this season. No matter how hard I try, or how much I be nice to my team and try to get them to change the way they are playing, no matter if I try split push to grouping, building defensive or offensive, once I see a few minutes if how everyone plays and what their attitude is, I know who is going to win.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-06-01T15:04:56.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok I'll expand my question:\n\n**Why** tell everyone in the game this? They are obviously shitters, they don't understand. By saying these things you only reduce the morale of the team. You gotta understand that many players in your division are absolute jizzlers, thanks to dynamic queue. It takes a different mentality now in ranked to win games.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Unknown101","date":"2016-06-01T13:06:40.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> It goes a little something like this: -**MUTE**\n> _You didn&amp;#039;t camp top lane and forced my friend to rage quit, your fault.**-MUTE**\n> My friends are feeding, your fault. - **MUTE**\n> You didn&amp;#039;t gank when I asked you to and I didn&amp;#039;t get the kill, your fault. - **MUTE**\n> OMG I am getting camped, but the jungler is premade with me, still your fault._ - **MUTE**\n\n> Please Riot, give us some incentive to bother trying to play when players will abuse you, not help you, lay blame on anyone other than their friends and basically make your gaming experience a shit one. - **/MUTE ALL**\n\nBasicly if you don't like the abuse mute them, when has anyone in your games said something to make you feel better. \nMy last game  fizz was abusing mao because he was making bad jungling decisions but he was turret diving a morgana. So they argued when asked them to mute each other fizz started on me because i was 1/3/2 at 10mins because my support lulu was ks. But I did not try to justify what happen he would not of cared, all I did was /mute all and carried the team.\nAnd if they will not play the way you want you got to play the way they want because they will just get rekt 4 v 5. Even if you know better that the minion wave pushing bot will take the inhib turret and they still want to fight. Because you will not be able to stop a 1 v 5.\n\nP.S.

My team never grouped much early, and by the time we did, too late, they were too strong and we couldn't win.\n\nP.S. I get posts here, like I do on most of my stuff, because I am actually starting to get people who think the same way I do, especially since Riot pulled out that shit \"We will never bring back Solo queue\". They ruined the game with Dynamic queue and cannot accept it, the game has gone down the drain and Riot need to realise this. too much team and premades who are only doing it for the rewards.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-05-31T00:47:46.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on your match history,\n\nYou were playing Nasus top.

But we keep farming and doing necessary things without giving up, and we won. Mind you, I played with bronzes team mates (just one friend premade, the rest are random). I got lucky? No, because I keep encouraging my teammates to keep playing on.\n\nSee for yourself: http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/135360926/1?tab=overview\n\nPicture this as a practice in your real life.\nAs **you can NOT expect the game to turn into your favor in the first 8 minutes**,\nyou can NOT also expect anything in life to turn into your favor.\nNo one has that kind of favor. One thing that successful people do is to keep pressing on.\n\nAs one wise man says,\n_Winners never quit\nQuitters never win_\n\nIn this case, even though you didnt quit leave the game, you did try to _do something_ which is changing Nasus build. There is a reason why the best Nasus should only be built as tank, not AD damage.\nThere are many Nasus videos you can watch and learn, such as this one\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK8Qna6p4ew\n\nOr if you want you can also watch SirHcez, which is a high-elo Nasus main.\n\nHope this helps.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-05-30T21:56:31.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"get over it and play solo carry champions\n\nhonestly shut the fuck up\n\nthese things are only a problem in normals","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-06-01T04:30:15.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well unlike you who premakes their teams and is doing what Riot wants them to do, I don't and get stuck with players who fail.
