By the end her stats were abysmal.\r\n\r\nI have had games were I started bad, made it to level 18, got all my items and still felt like I was doing nothing. On the flip side, when I start well, regardless of how long the game goes for, I feel like I am doing extremely well for the entire game.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else feel this way?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-01-17T07:55:31.786+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's more or less not understanding champion matchups then anything else having looked at the game.\n\n1st thing, Graves hits like a truck, that's always going to happen, and vayne while she can do a lot of damage, when your behind you have to sustain a fight, and she shouldn't even survive the 3 shotgun shells + Q meaning she can't extend the fight to her advantage.\n2nd thing, the way a game feels tends to be a mind set, and that's why good starts make the rest of the game feel good to you.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-01-17T10:18:56.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not that, that was just an example. I have noticed it a lot that when you are in front early, regardless of how long the game lasts, that person always seems to be hitting harder than the rest.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2016-01-17T14:20:03.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're starting to sound newb. Of course a well-off start can give you an advantage. That's like questioning why you get fat from eating nothing but Mcdonalds. It's like asking why friction causes shit to get hotter as you apply more pressure. \n\nYou need to learn that there is so much to learn in league. Challengers and masters are literally so fricken informed in the game you have no idea.\n\nI'll give you an example. You go ap blitzcrank and think \"so op wow such doge... We aren't winning cuz nub adc always shit.\" You went ap but if you never land a hook you're never gonna land that damage are you. When you could be going stuff like zekes to help your adc and Locket to help the team if the enemy has dickloads of aoe. Another popular example: you go Lee Sin and build damage. Yes you're gonna kick ass and one shot the adc until he gets some items but late game you're gonna be the adcs bitch. If you're the only tank on the team and you build damage; you deserve to lose.

Again, with 10 players at level 18 and 6 full items.\n\nTo me it feels like if you start well, you end well regardless of anything. I see players start bad all the time and never recover, they die fast and do low damage right to the very end.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"deadmau5","date":"2016-01-17T14:32:40.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends, no game is ever black and white. Of course a slight advantage in the early game is going to have an impact on your late game, but it doesn't always mean its a good one. You always have to consider things such as champion scaling, the champion itself, how well you or the enemy team coordinates in team fights and lastly the skill of the players themselves. Also for me, level>items, in almost every game i've played, if you are out-leveling your opponents rather than out-itemising them, you are most likely going to finish stronger late game and come out on top. Usually with out-leveling comes out-itemising aswell, but the overall factor to the graves vs vayne scenario was the difference in levels. Vayne was 3 levels behind, yet only had half an item less, it is clear that levels were the deciding factor in this (although it may have been one player was highly more skilled than the other), but i would safely presume that keeping on top with levels in game is more important than getting 1 or 2 kills and risking losing alot of experience loss.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-01-17T10:07:34.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've actually noticed this as well. I think it comes down to the fact that Graves was ahead for a reason. He was better than your Vayne.\n\nHe is a better player and deals more DPS because of it. Also, it's likely Vayne doesn't realise what she has become, and greatly underestimates her power, thinking Graves will 1 hit her like it's the mid game.","replies":[]}]}
