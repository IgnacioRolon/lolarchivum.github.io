You are screwed, you may have the penta, but unless you are good enough to use those kills, late game will only come back to get you.\r\n\r\nChamp balancing may work at top rank where players know what other champions can do, again at low rank where you get players who can play 20-30 champs well, but don&#039;t really know much about others will end up feeding them, not because of how the champs work, but their lack of knowledge.\r\n\r\nDoes it really make sense to cater for the top % of players and let the general populace suffer? Or is it a better idea to actually look at 100% of the stats, or at least say the top 80% of players and change the game to suit everyone?\r\n\r\nTrue you are going to get those wood division players who have zero idea of anything, let alone what another champ can do, but if you put in a little time you can get over that. But I am thinking of new players here, they come into the game upon seeing some good game play and suck ass because the top % is nothing like the bottom %.\r\n\r\nI think Riot don&#039;t need to change the overall game to cater for the bottom % of players, but more so possibly have 2 sets of &#039;rules&#039;, say gold and lower and than those above gold, like different matchmaking, different queue systems, a different remake and whatnot.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-07-18T05:50:59.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Riot** does make some balance changes specifically for pro-play (they've said this themselves). There's probably a decent case to be made for why they shouldn't do that. But I can't say I agree with your view on DQ.\n\nDynamic Queue only works well with a large player base, which is exactly the opposite of what they have in high elo. **Riot** decided to go ahead and implement DQ for high elo anyway, and it ended up being a disaster TBH. **Scarra** covered most of the issues pretty well in that [roundtable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwPa1SGLGv0) discussion.\n\n_There's been some improvements since then, but high elo still has it pretty bad:_\n\n+ There's now auto-fill, which randomly selects roles for players, meaning no one gets their desired role sometimes.\n+ Premades are limited to 3. So they don't get to experience the full benefits of DQ anyway.\n+ There's now a big [smurfing issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4scaej/nearly_every_ranked_game_in_diamond_is_coming/?ref=search_posts). Everyone wants lower queue times and their preferred roles, so a huge proportion of the Challenger players have started smurfing. It's now causing balance issues in Diamond.\n\nI'm interested though, _why do you think dynamic queue is working really well at high elo, and really badly in lower tiers?_ It's quite likely I've missed some key points or I'm not fully understanding the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Buttsubushi","date":"2016-07-18T12:16:16.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only thing that feels bad in low elo is when you que up solo and are put with a premade 4 or 3 or even sometimes 2 against what is a fair match usually with the right amount of premades on each side, but then the whole game is decided by who's premades are better and the solo players feel like they have no impact when the premades ignore them. If play solo and you lose a game in this situation, your premade made bad calls/screwed up as a group which is nothing you could of done about, and if you win cause that premade went full cloud9 on the other team you still feel useless as a team member. \n\nI don't know, since with VERBAL communication which is INSTANTANEOUS and doesn't require you to spend precious moments typing out what you want everyone to do, you can just say something with the body part that isn't on a mouse or keyboard, BAM everyone in your little premade is on the same page. \n\nMakes sense to some people queuing in premades. \n\nAnd has made sense for many other game devs.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-07-18T13:06:53.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you think having voice chat for solo players (like in Overwatch) will help balance out DQ quite a bit? \n\n**Riot**'s talked about it a bit in the past, and from what you're saying it looks like voice chat might allow solo players to contribute to a premade game easily.","replies":[{"poster":"Buttsubushi","date":"2016-07-18T13:40:42.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be great for me, but it would be a double edged sword for the whole ranking system. It would be implicitly expected of ALL players  join in with voice and cooperate like crazy, and those can't and want to have a quiet game of league or have a language barrier will be roasted by their team and even if they aren't they will still feel like they don't have any influence.\n\nIf Riot was to bring in an integrated coms it would have to be in Ranked Teams first because people use other coms in that already, then be added later to something like Normal Draft (....... why OCE?) where Riot could do more testing with coms combining premade with solos and all of the team comps would be quickly decided early, and the ranking system would skew towards favoring team players over mechanical players.\n\nThen with it added to Dynamic Ranked, every game would be as intense as a Ranked Teams, which is good for tryhards, but will make it difficult for some people like solo q streamers.\n\nIt is a good idea, but my god there will be a million other consequences that I haven't even thought about that could change whole system.\n\nBTW, what the OP is complaining about I have no idea, and my point of premades ruining/carrying solos games only happens 1 out of about 8 games for me.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
