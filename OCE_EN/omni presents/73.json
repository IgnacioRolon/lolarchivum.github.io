It could be handy in ranked to use it to give or take players ranking from them, right?\r\n\r\nI mean, if you play selfish, even with a moderate score and tons of CS, you could still have a low score. I have seen players with bad CS, no kills, but tons of assists and decent stats get A or better and players with lots of kills, but bad CS and whatnot have a bad score.\r\n\r\nQuestion is, how does the scoring system actually work? Does it take ALL stats and calculate your worth to the team and give you a rank based on that?\r\n\r\nOK, so I just read up on it, and it seems good, works out the champion, role, stats and whatnot against other players in the same situation in your region and gives you a score.\r\n\r\nSo how come we don&#039;t use it for anything useful? It would be nice if it calculated your Elo, a C would give nothing, C+ a bit of rank and C- lose a bit and so on, or thereabouts.","replies":[{"poster":"Jonius7","date":"2015-09-01T21:44:42.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They might change some things for the 2016 season, probably wouldn't want to make significant changes in the middle of this ranked season.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-01T15:55:04.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like it","replies":[]}]}
