By the time I was 2/5, with the second best score on my team, Graves was 14/0. Our Vayne not once the whole game was doing any noticeable damage, her AA simply done nothing and the only time she really done anything was when she ulted and got her 3 hit combo, even than it was pitiful.\n\nNext game I go 14/7 as Annie, all lanes had very similar matchups, 2 tanky AP top, 2 squishy burst damage AP mid and 2 tanky AD jungles with some CC. By mid game, every time Ahri attacked me I would QWR her and kill her, Tibbers was on a 46 second CDR and active for 45 seconds, enough time to kill Ahri, wait for her to spawn and be ready with another R to kill her with. It got to the point we were going 0v5 and winning, I had Tibbers scaring away 5 of them, just Tibbers, no minions, no players, just one bear.\n\nThe games are so one sided that it makes you wonder what Rito are doing with MM, or is it just that there are too many new players coming into ranked that the cesspool of shit in Bronze is just too much for MM to handle?\n\n2 games ago the enemy Graves was clearly outside of where he belongs, otherwise the Vayne was clearly out of her league. Last game I was either against a useless mid, or came across 9 other players who, due to how MM is, were lower skilled than me, yet same MMR. I didn&#039;t even feel like I was trying in that game it was so easy.","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-02-12T23:54:30.753+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I stopped reading when I saw graves went from 0/6 to 14/0","replies":[]},{"poster":"Curse of Annubis","date":"2016-02-14T08:06:51.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just learn to play easy champions that are strong.
