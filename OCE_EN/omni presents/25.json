That is crap. I can admit to having 2 loses for being part my fault for losing laning phase horribly. I had 8 games were I either broke even or had a winning lane and yet still lost in 4 of those games, in all but one my bot lane was just terrible and one of jungle or mid was bad. Now I don&#039;t consider laning a win or lose based on your score, but how well you can dictate and defend your lane or push for a tower. I had a game recently that the enemy jungler camped me for a good 20 minutes, I had a low KDA, but still got more kills than my lane opponent, more CS and my tower first. Even my jungler was surprised that the other 2 lanes were losing the way I was being camped.\r\n\r\nHaving a good lane phase and looking at the map or scoreboard realising you have lost is never fun. 2 games ago I was going mostly 1v3 in the top lane... I was forcing at least 3 at times to defend the lane, when it was 1v1 I killed my opponent and walked away full health, but before the 20 minute mark we had already lost the mid inhibitor. So between the enemy pushing mid and defending top my team still couldn&#039;t defend.\r\n\r\nLast game my AD lost to an Annie/Soraka lane, at 18 minutes by the time  their AD Annie first came to mid she was more than double my AD score when I triple killed her, Soraka and Malph before dying to Wukong. At 35 minutes our AD, instead of joining the team, was STILL in the jungle farming, every team fight with no AD.\r\n\r\nHow can you honestly expect to win games and get a high placement, or even carry yourself out of Bronze when most of your games are like this? There are only a small % of players who can solo carry themselves out of bronze, most players I see join teams or just get stuck at the ass end of the game.\r\n\r\nFYI - Years ago when I did join ranked with other players I made higher than gold during the season, this was back when it was just one division in each rank. When you are able to win your lane with ease in most of your games and know your team is not going to fold before 10 minutes, it is really easy to win games. But when your team fails at laning phase, like, gets shat on, there is only so much you can do. I am a decent player, but not someone who can carry in these virtual 4v5 games I am getting into.\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s get serious, if I am winning my lane and forcing more than one person to try stop me, yet my team is folding like a deck of cards, what do I do? Do I keep pushing my lane forcing more than one enemy to defend and that my team can do something useful by outnumbering the enemy, or join them and hope for a 5v5 team fight that we can win?\r\n\r\nI love watching high ranked games because of how I play, it&#039;s good to see players focus on trying to get CS and deny their opponent CS with the occasional kill here and there early. They focus on what is important, staying alive and defending their lanes. Down in bronze every second player has the mentality that you must get kills early. I&#039;ve seen players with great KDA, but no CS, no towers and losing their lanes.\r\n\r\nIt seems that unless I have a REALLY good lane phase and smash my opponent before my team can lose their lane, or I get at least one other lane do well do I ever have a chance at a win. I just think it is extremely unfair that within the first 10-15 minutes you can do good in lane, get some kills, out CS your opponent and even get an early tower, yet lost the game and have nothing to show for doing your part. I am of the thought that you get good CS early, defend your lane and set yourself up for the win, so many times I see my team trying hard for early kills, not focusing on CS and failing.","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2016-01-24T15:08:46.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you broke even/or won lane in 8 games, and won half of them. Sounds about right. You need to do a lot more than break even or win lane in order to actually carry games. If you want your advantage to mean anything then you need to take that advantage to the rest of the map before the enemies bring their advantage to you. Bringing 2 or 3 people top means nothing if your team is already behind and a fed enemy can 1v2 your teammates elsewhere. Instead you should be that guy making the proactive move and ganking someone 2v1 or 3v1 before they can roam. If you're staying in lane, getting small advatages for the first 20 minutes, then yes, most games will be decided for you, either your team will have a big lead and you win, or your team will have a big deficit and you will lose, and it will be about 50/50.\n\nIf you want to improve, i suggest focusing on your mid game map movements and decision making. Improving your laning more and stomping lane harder will make very little difference if you're not using that lead in a meaningful way.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-01-25T14:11:27.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do try and roam when I can, if I have the health and timing between waves I will do what is possible, from top I sometimes TP to bot, walking is pointless unless I come from base, but than I give my opponent to much free space.\n\nI tried jungle a few games ago, yet another game that bot lane failed, they went a combined 3/25 and had some pretty bad stats, combined damage done and dealt was either the same or lower than me as Voli. That makes now including the game I just played, 3 of 22 games that bot lane actually done well, all 3 were easy wins, the rest of my wins we had to carry bot lane.\n\nI always thought the very basic of this game was to defend your own lane for the first X minutes until someone got enough gold to launch an attack, push for a tower and start the end of the lane phase. You need to get some CS, try to harass your opponent, out CS them, get a kill if you can without sacrifice, none of this \"HUH DUH let's dive at level 3 and give away a double kill\". Low rank is a joke, players push under the enemy tower, then proceed to complain they died and are losing CS.\n\nThe worst I have ever had went a little something like this, and I tried to find this game, it is too old now I think. Sometime during S5 I went Yi Jungle, I had me and a 4 man premade, all 4 stated they were on the same network, should be no issues with communication. I went and got close to 250,000 PLAYER damage and almost 1 MILLION damage dealt. With more than 30 kills and less than 5 deaths I took something like 9 towers and an inhibitor, solo killed Baron and 4 dragons, yet we lost. The next best on my team had something like 2 kills and almost 10 deaths. There was no way i could defend 3 lanes, I would run to one lane, kill someone, but by the time I got down to the next lane, half our tower was dead. It was virtually me and 4 speed bumps vs 5 withes hats with legs.\n\nThat is what happens when I ignore everything and focus 100% on the game, and it was not fun at all. I want a game that is actually enjoyable, something were 10 players of equal skill get together and try their best, my game I just finished was as close as I have come to that in some time. I just wish they would give me some incentive to actually give 100% all the time in every game, but that is not easy when you look at the map and see your teams first towers gone in under 10 minutes with a lopsided scoreboard, it makes you want to give up.\n\nIt's easy, let's say I get an A- score and my team average C, I should still get a lose, but a +LP for my effort therefore I can use my own skill level to be matched with others of my same skill rather than rely of 4 others to do anything other than feed.","replies":[]}]}]}
