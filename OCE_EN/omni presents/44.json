I thought when the Blitz got picked we may actually have a chance, I was wrong about that.\r\n\r\nAt least when I get last pick and forced to support I pre warn my team I can&#039;t do it.\r\n\r\nAny advice what to do when our support just trolls you? Or is there nothing you can do?","replies":[{"poster":"vicelore","date":"2015-08-18T04:01:22.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope you dont play ranked if you cant support..","replies":[]}]}
