I lost my last game thanks to my team buying Tower Beam and not stopping the minions from pushing.\r\n\r\nSecond, it&#039;s just a plain rubbish mode, nothing for 10 minutes and than 3-5 minutes of 6 towers and 3 inhibitors falling. It needs more balance to allow a more flowing game, not this &#039;Stale mate &gt; GOGOGO&#039; stuff.\r\n\r\nThird, where is Urf mode? Last time it was out was before Siege came the first time, we got 2 siege and now have a third. If I read the murmurs on the net correctly, we are not getting Urf back, and that sucks since Riot never really confirmed it was going anywhere.\r\n\r\nUrf mode simply one of two reasons I am still here, the other is to stay in the game long enough to see what happens in S7, and if that falls to shit like S6, I am done, for good.\r\n\r\nI would at least like the courtesy of Riot to acknowledge what is going on with Urf mode, no strings attached, none of this &quot;You will get it at least twice a year&quot; crap and than spring it on us twice in a month and nothing for 11 more months. That is the least I deserve after being here for now over 5 years.","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-09-06T23:56:06.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They did annouce an ARURF on aram.
