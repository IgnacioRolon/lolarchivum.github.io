I actually had kills near the bottom of importance and had damage dealt, damage taken and turrets even above damage to enemy champions, which I had above kills.\n\nYou see, the ones who actually play the game, those who care to bother knowing what actually needs to be done to win, we know what stats matter, Riot don't. I think Riot have their head to far up Masters and Challengers ass to realise how the game should be working now.\n\nGetting kills is the last thing we should be focusing on. I can go into a game and get triple or quadruple the damage of anyone on the map, I have even had those rare games where I got triple damage against EVERYONE ELSE IN THE GAME combined. But I got a shit scorecard, why? My CS and Kills where down.\n\nLet me ask you this, if you were to go Nunu (or better yet Voli) on full man mode against 5 enemy AD, all you would be doing is building armour and health, right? That means you would survive everything and can tank all day every day, therefore you should, if playing right, tank more damage than both world wars combined. But currently as it stands, if you get low CS and kills, you get no recognition from Riot for the effort.\n\nIf you use my formulas, and again I have proven this before, you WILL get recognised since your damage taken would be that much higher, and if done right you will have tons of assists in comparing your stats against NINE other players, not 900,000 other players, and therefore you get a better overall score (scoring system on my spreadsheet), the game will recognise this and you will get a better scorecard.\n\nI just had a game as Teemo on TT, I played, average at best, but I got an A, how? I got enough kills and CS since we dragged the game out long enough to at least try to have some fun. I mean, the game was over at like 10 minutes, I decided not to group with my team ever just to not have a 15 minute game, and therefore rorted Riots system and got myself a decent scorecard.","replies":[{"poster":"Buttsubushi","date":"2016-08-01T09:29:31.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I have made a spreadsheet\n\nlink?\n\n>we know what stats matter, Riot don't.\n\nAnd they are?\n\n>Getting kills is the last thing we should be focusing on. \n\nNope. Dead enemies = more towers + more farm + more objectives + more gold + better chance of your team winning. However Assists and Kills should be equal IMO. FOR EVERY ROLE. \n\n>Let me ask you this, if you were to go Nunu (or better yet Voli) on full man mode against 5 enemy AD, all you would be doing is building armour and health, right?

But currently as it stands, if you get low CS and kills, you get no recognition from Riot for the effort.\n\nBuilding to counter the other team means you will die less, and get more assists and kills in teamfights. Which is what you need to do in order for your team to win. And Riot gives you less ratings for dieing less and getting more kills and assists. And to become more tanky sooner, you will need to have high CS.\n\n>I just had a game as Teemo on TT\n\nPlz just keep this to SR only. The rating system for RGM and TT/ARAM is a joke and everyone knows it, Riot doesn't even give 6/7 tokens for S ranks in these game modes. There is no where near close to the amount of data that is used for SR ratings. There is an established 5 roles and an elo system that have been used for years on SR.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-07-18T15:14:02.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive been playing yorick supp/jngl for the past 2 weeks, i started off at mastery 2 as i'd played him top a little bit in the past and im now 1 token off mastery 7\n\nFeelsgoodman.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-07-18T15:15:15.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is what it is.
