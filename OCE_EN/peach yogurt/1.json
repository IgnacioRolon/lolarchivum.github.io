Riot could either give her a frilly skirt to match with the frilly top or just casual swim shorts. She&#039;ll have flip-flops on.\r\n\r\nI think it would be funny if she had those pool floats around her arm and if they wanted to include a necklace, it could be a shell. Her hair could be blonde, blending into blue colours and she could have shells, sand, and maybe a crab in her hair. \r\n\r\nQ = Water balloon that breaks and splashes when it hits the enemies\r\nW = Bubbles with a shell or fish inside\r\nE = One of those safety rings that lifeguards use \r\nR = Mini inflatable pools, like the one Zac has in his recall. \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t really know what her recall would look like but it would be funny to include something with the floaties.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have anything to add on to the idea or something better than mine.","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2018-01-12T11:27:13.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im calling the police","replies":[{"poster":"Peach Yogurt","date":"2018-01-12T21:11:21.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{summoner:6}} {{summoner:6}} *naruto opening plays*","replies":[]}]}]}
