She fed then blames bot lane for being the reason she fed. I don&#039;t understand why there are people that play off-meta things in ranked games. It&#039;s fine if you play them in normals but in ranked, you&#039;re effecting your whole team if you lose. It&#039;s so easy for someone to troll and get away with it and that isn&#039;t fair on players that are negatively impacted by it.\r\n\r\nThis isn&#039;t the first time someone has done that before. I&#039;ve had Taric jg, who ran straight into 3 people then blamed bot lane for not following up even though we were pushed in and low hp from the amount of poke we were taking. I&#039;ve vsed against a JG Zyra who did quite well early game but ended up trolling late game. \r\n\r\nWhy is it that one person has the power to ruin/lose a game just by locking in a troll pick or by running it down mid? \r\n\r\nI&#039;m not saying that you automatically lose when someone runs it down mid because I&#039;ve recovered from one of those games, where a Yi got upset that we accidentally took his blue and then came to our lane and fed. 20 mins later, he&#039;s 3 shotting their carry and we won that game. I was extremely lucky that the Yi had a change of heart but some people aren&#039;t as fortunate and end up losing lp/promos.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2018-01-11T03:11:22.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like someone was watching some Voyboy and thought he could be cool too.","replies":[{"poster":"Peach Yogurt","date":"2018-01-11T05:50:30.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't like Voyboy","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2018-01-11T06:32:54.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I don't either but his Ad lb is so good, guess kids these days can't distinguish between pro's and your average noob player.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
