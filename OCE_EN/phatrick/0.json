Even if Riot wont revert the punishment, it can be helpful in identifying flaws in the system. Any relevant information can give them a place to start from to identify why the false positive occurred and help prevent them in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-10-26T09:11:54.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A valid point, if something had gone wrong then definitely, even if they can't/won't change anything it's worth them knowing.
