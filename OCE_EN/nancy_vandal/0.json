His strength is the ability to engage and playing champions like Alistar and Thresh\n\nHis weakness is likely the fact that he will get excited and try to engage at bad times if his team isn't doing anything, the engages are good! Just poorly timed.\nThis weakness isn't enough in OCE to make him worse though, and I'd say he is still a solid #1.","replies":[]}]}
