We&rsquo;re a casual gaming community created for gamers, by gamers. What does that mean for you? It means that we strive to create a group that&rsquo;s open to all players &ndash; whether you&rsquo;re just getting started, or whether you&rsquo;re still relishing the days of Force of Nature (trust us, we miss it too). It&rsquo;s not surprising, then, with this focus on community, that we&rsquo;ve been able to attract hundreds of regularly active members across our divisions, with a healthy balance of both male and female gamers.\n\nWhile some groups orient themselves to players just &ldquo;looking for a group&rdquo;, at Zealot Gaming we&rsquo;re more than that. We understand that while having someone to queue up with in games is great, we also believe it shouldn&rsquo;t be the only reason someone wants to join our great community. We are looking for players who want more out of their games than just a simple match history.\n\nAre you looking to not only meet fellow gamers, but to be part of something bigger than just filling up a normal queue?\n\nThen Zealot Gaming is perfect for you!\n\n\nWHAT WE OFFER YOU:\n\nFamily\n\nWhile zG is a large-scale casual gaming community, it comes with a small-scale feel. This means you&rsquo;ll almost always have someone to play with, but you also won&rsquo;t feel like you&rsquo;re part of some huge, impersonal clan. This is because we have a close-knit community of people and whose members care about each other &ndash; in and out of the game.\n\nDifferent Backgrounds\n\nWe have a wide range of players, from those with no prior clan experience before zG, to those with extensive history in gaming clans, from those who are unranked to our gold and platinum members. \n\nGamenights\n\nzG&rsquo;s League OCE division hosts optional in-house gamenights every Tuesday and Saturday. We play everything from custom 5v5s, to special game modes such as ultimate bravery.\n\nRanked Teams\n\nAre you matching up with randoms in ranked? Maybe that bit about &lsquo;ultimate bravery&rsquo; belongs here? We offer our members various ranked teams, from the casual teams looking for a consistent group, to the more serious players looking to climb the ranks.\n\nStructure\n\nAt the backbone of our community are several different positions with defined roles, and responsibilities. This helps provide clarity as to who is responsible for what, while at the same time providing our members various opportunities to rank up if they desire.\n\nThe Justice System\n\nWhile Zealot Gaming is a very laid-back environment, we understand that occasionally circumstances come up that may need to be reviewed. In addition to a friendly, and open divisional staff who are eager to discuss any questions or concerns you may have, we have created a Justice System, which allows members to submit a ticket directly to clan leadership for review.\n\nMulti-title Support\n\nOur members also play other titles such as Hereos of the Storm, DOTA, CS:GO, Hearthstone, and many more. This means that while you&#039;re joining a League community, you&#039;ll have members to play other games with as well.\n\nTeamspeak &amp; Website\n\nWe host both a fully featured website, that includes our rosters, rules, gamenight info, community discussions, etc. and an extremely active TeamSpeak server for all of our divisions. Both are open to guests and members.\n\n---\n\n\nHOW YOU CAN JOIN:\n\nApply on our website (required): http://www.zealotgaming.com/register.php\n\nYou must be 16-years or older to apply, and also agree to our rules and activity requirements:\n\nClan Rules\nActivity Requirements\n\nWHAT&#039;S NEXT?\n\nOnce your application has been submitted, a Division Officer will add you in-game to finish the recruitment process. You can also add them to discuss the clan, or touch base on your application (adding them will help speed up your recruitment - feel free to add multiple).\n\nDivision Officer: [zG]Vautour \nIGN: Vautour {{champion:161}} \n\nDivision Officer: [zG]Ultimatean\nIGN: Ultimatean {{champion:432}} \n\nDivision Officer: [zG]Claire\nIGN: Claire {{champion:222}} \n\nDivision Officer: [zG]GalaxyBear\nIGN: Galaxybear {{champion:67}} \n\nDivision Officer: [zG]Jepman\nIGN: Jepman {{champion:17}} \n\nTeam Manager: [zG]Diesel\nIGN: Clench {{champion:41}} \n\nWe look forward to seeing you on the Rift!\n\nPS.
