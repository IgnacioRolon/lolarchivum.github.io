His target was sitting in the air on the edge of one of the floating isles,  meditating . She wore almost exclusively black but had long white hair, not from age but from magic. He had asked around in the nearby town what these floating isles were and what had raised them. Some said a demon of pure darkness, others said a goddess of immense power, one old man had said she was once a student at an Ionian school but she had surpassed her master and killed him for trying to restrain her. \r\nZed checked his weapons and his shadows, they were ready. He leapt from one island to the next, switching with a shadow halfway to make the huge jump. His target stood and looked where his shadow was hovering in the air, he quickly pulled it back into himself. Zed cloaked himself in shadows and hid in the lee of a wall. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;A magic similar to my own had disturbed my meditation. It was a magic that seemed to manipulate shadows into somewhat solid forms. But who would dare to venture up here? To my home&hellip;&rdquo;\r\n\r\nShe floated over to where she had seen the shadow construct. It was gone now but tiny magical traces were still in the air. She sent out magical threads to try and find the source of the shadows. \r\n\r\nZed moved behind a different wall, avoiding the little threads she was sending out. They were everywhere! You would&#039;ve thought she should have already had these set up&hellip;\r\n\r\nA bunny knocks over a pot and Syndra spins around, sending a torrent of dark orbs and flinging a boulder for good measure. She realises her mistake when the dust clears.\r\n\r\nZed senses that she is distracted and cuts the threads around him as he moves to a place he can strike from. He sets up as many shades as he can before descending into the shadows and laying a mark on her.\r\n\r\nSyndra sees shades of some ninja all around and a shadowy mark of some sort above her. The ninja is standing on a roof, laughing. He throws two shuriken in a straight line towards her, every shade does the same, all in her direction. The air grows heavy with darkness. \r\n\r\nThe shurikens disappeared in the dark cloud that was growing around her. Was she dead? She ought to be after that many attacks&hellip; He froze. He heard laughing, laughing that was not his own.\r\n\r\nSyndra couldn&#039;t help herself from bursting out in laughter. She flicked the shuriken away with a dark wave.\r\n &ldquo;Zed, my friend, why would you come to my temples and make an attempt on my life?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Syndra? I was given a contract by someone to slay the demon of the floating isles&hellip;&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;What fool would send someone to slay me?!&ldquo;\r\nZed paused for a moment, unsure if he should tell her.\r\nSyndra shattered his shades and grabbed him in an unshakeable grip of dark magic, &ldquo;Who?!&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;It was on the town message board of the town down there.&rdquo; Zed pointed to the town closest to the isles as she released him.\r\n&ldquo;Thank you. You are free to go, however, if I ever see you here, I will not hesitate to end your life.&rdquo; Zed bowed and slipped into a shadow portal, it led back to his own temple.\r\n\r\nSyndra sat facing the town, readying her powers. Deep breath in, slow breath out. Form a tangible force. Deep breath in, slow breath out. Make it inescapable. Deep breath in, slow breath out. Make it lethal.\r\n\r\nThe usually bustling market stopped as the sun was blotted out by what looked like a giant dark orb, high in the sky. Ethereal walls bordered the town, trapping people in as they were driven to panic. The dark purple sphere began shifting to a furious red. Was that thing getting larger?\r\n\r\nDeep breath in, slow breath out. End them.\r\nThe sphere plummeted down, shaking the entire area around the town, some said they felt tremors even in Bandle City. The devastation was contained to and focused only on the town, due to the walls she had set up.\r\nSyndra descended to assess her work, she breathed a silent thanks to Veigar, who taught her these two spells. She in turn had taught him how to manipulate someone else&#039;s magic, though only minimally. Veigar doesn&#039;t have nearly as much power as she does, and that only works if you are stronger than your target.\r\nThere was no trace of the town, save a massive crater. Syndra moved a nearby hill to fill the hole and distributed some plants and animals telepathically to hide what she had done. She went back to her isles and moved them along, heading for the continent of Valoran.","replies":[]}
