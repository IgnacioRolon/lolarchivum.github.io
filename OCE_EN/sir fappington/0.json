I&#039;ve spent about $500-$600 on it. Over the last 3 days every time I get into game my frames will drop from the usual 160ish to 20-30. The game will bugsplat every couple of minutes and when I try to file the report the bugsplat crashes? Which then causes my computer to freeze. I now have 20 queues to wait and after my I&#039;ve waited a queue I will probably get more bugsplats which will inevitably mean more 20 minute queues. Please do something to fix this. Many players are posting about the same problem on the league of legends reddit.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-25T16:37:35.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try running through the steps here and let me know how it goes:\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues","replies":[]}]}
