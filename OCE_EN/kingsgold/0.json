Everyone experiences afkers and rage quitters or even worse, feeders. You are not special mate and most of us have learned to deal with it. You wanna call the game cancer? Fine but know most people have experienced worse and are still able to enjoy the game without resorting to saltiness.","replies":[{"poster":"kingsgold","date":"2016-05-31T09:03:38.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How is a 3v5 game in ranked enjoyable? When he consequences of losing are the same as if it were 5v5?","replies":[{"poster":"Very Funny","date":"2016-05-31T09:14:41.580+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly, I never said a 3v5 game would be enjoyable, I never even said that word. More to the point I said that the game would suck, _**especially**_ if it was ranked.\n\nSecondly, it has always been like that. Whether it be 5v5, 4v5, 3v5, 2v5 or god forbid a 1v5, the consequences of losing a ranked game have always been the same and until riot gets their shit together, will always be the case.\n\nSo I will reiterate my first point. Why are you whining when I am sure you know most of us deal with this as often as you do. The difference being we don't publicly whine about it.\n\nAlso, this gives me another point. What were you hoping to achieve by posting this?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2016-06-04T10:21:22.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tend to side with him. Out of the many many multiplayer based games I've played over the years on both console and PC, League has to be THE biggest toxic cancer game out of all... by far (actually I should mention just the OCE server). It's just the biggest cesspit of asshole's who go out of their way to just frustrate and annoy others. Sure every multiplayer game would experience some sort of this behavior, but league is just rank with it.","replies":[]}]}
