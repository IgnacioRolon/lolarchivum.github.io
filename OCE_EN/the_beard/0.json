Here's how while keeping everyone happy.","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"As it is currently, Tuesday and Wednesday are dedicated to normal twisted treeline days and Thursday and Friday are dedicated to ranked. My suggestion is to take away one of the normal days and replace it with another ranked day. With this I would also suggest to change the 3 ranked days into Monday, Wednesday and Friday with the normal day slotting into either Tuesday or Thursday. My line of reasoning is as follows. \r\n\r\n1. In my opinion the twisted treeline community has struggled to retain a large base of casual players on Oceania because of the infrequency and the huge time lapse between the days, by the time Thursday comes around again many casual people have lost the hype from the previous week.\r\n\r\n2. By increasing the amount of ranked days to 3 you&#039;ve obviously increased the amount of time people can play and grind significantly. It makes people feel like they can actually grind towards a desired rank even if they start late into the season. As it is currently, if somebody wanted to start now they would have a tough time reaching the higher up divisions simply due to a lack of time. \r\n\r\n3. By spreading the days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday format) players would never have to wait longer than 2 days to be able to play ranked twisted treeline  and would give teams/duos/friends much more incentive to pick the game mode up and play together on these days.\r\n\r\n4. Keeping one normal day is still a necessity so that people can experience the game mode for the first time, or see if they want to get involved in it at all but having 2 is somewhat redundant. It usually only takes people a handful of games to get the general gist of the game-mode and then they&#039;re keen to jump into ranked and test out their skills. With 3 ranked days spread out across the week there will be more opportunities to do that and even if they get placed low, they&#039;ll have plenty of games across the season to improve.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Make there be 3 ranked TT days instead of 2 (reduce the normals by 1) and put them on Mon, Wed, Fri.\r\n\r\nMAKE TWISTED TREELINE GREAT AGAIN","replies":[{"poster":"Stubborn","date":"2017-08-25T07:54:56.788+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"if riot buffs vi in TT only i will be happy {{champion:254}} {{item:3078}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flush","date":"2017-08-26T04:52:52.899+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think the number of days matters that much, I think the challenger slots should be expanded to 8-10 because currently half the top 6 challengers only play their decay games and the other half trio (from what I hear from my friend) so it's almost impossible to get in unless you're a trio that can beat the #1 3v3 player in OCE with over double the LP of 2nd place while he has 2 other challengers on his team. Why would anyone try to go for challenger when there are only 6 slots when they can just spam flex 5v5 to get in when there's 200 slots and not even half of them are taken. There is no incentive to play on the twisted treeline competitively simply because of the restricted spots available. Riot's excuse for 6 spots is so bullshit when you look at flex 5v5, they want their stupid dynamic queue to work so bad that they won't have less spots available for the summoner's rift map but they'll bottleneck twisted treeline for no reason.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Afince","date":"2017-08-27T09:07:29.968+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:78}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Cut","date":"2017-08-25T08:08:47.706+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think the timing of the days is as important as the number.
