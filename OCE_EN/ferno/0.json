They both have better cc. They are both tanky. Taric gives the armor buff but if the adc gets into a position in mid-late game than he needs that extra armor, he's probably dead anyway","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-03-16T01:09:03.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's more versatile than **Leona**, and a little worse than **Braum**. The main thing for me, is that he can play against any lane comfortably. But **Leona** will start to struggle against disengage **Poppy** or **Janna** lanes.\n\nThe **Sivir** match up isn't actually that bad BTW. I usually just bait out the spell shield with an E, so that it's down for ganks or the next trade. Definitely harder match-up than most though, you need to get ahead early.","replies":[{"poster":"you me","date":"2016-03-17T04:32:33.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to go from a ranked/competitive perspective. When you pick a support you are trying to fill a specific role that the team needs which may be:\n\n1. Disengage for poke comps\n2. Engage for dive comps\n3. CC for pick comps\n\nThe way he fills any of these roles is really lackluster like as you said he may be more versatile than Leona but she compliments the Engage/Pick comps way more than Taric. Being versatile and being medicore at one of these 3 traits doesn't really compare to being amazing and the perfect fit for one of the traits he sucks in pretty much all 3 of them maybe hes ok at pick comps but not really as his shatter is only 625 range. Leonas ult is 1250 range which is greatly superior meaning shes not a flash reliant champion like Taric may be in some situations (similar to Kennen, Annie and Sona). Pretty much Braum, Alistar and Leona fill that specific role better than him. \"A little worse than braum\" is a complete understatement. He's not even close to braum. This isn't even worth talking about as any decent player would realise that some of the Top Tier picks being Graves, Corki, Lucian, Ezreal lose so much DPS in team fights with Braum just being there. Plus Braums level one is just absurd, he's by far the best support in the game for invades/extended invades. Tarics laning phase is pretty average it does good even against most supports but laning phase isn't really what you should judge your entire argument on. Janna, Soraka, Alistar, Braum still have better laning phases than Taric. The problem is he still doesn't compliment the 3 important factors that comps are based around.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-03-17T05:17:51.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He fits in a team fight composition I'd say. It's a little unconventional for pro-play now, but the AOE teamfight meta was really big back in the day. You'll find most gold or lower games are perfect for teamfight metas. It's why **Amumu** and **Wukong** have had solid winrates for the past 2+ years.\n\nEither way, he's got the 2nd highest winrate out off all tank supports, and the easiest kit in the game. I think that on it's own makes him massively underrated. If you can godlike **Thresh** though, then obviously don't play **Taric** XD","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2016-03-16T01:19:30.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Naut OP, wtf lol, he is strong but not OP, he needs not to get a nerf either, his power level is where it should be, i play him support mostly, if you get a good adc/jg (depending where you play him) guarenteed kills (on the proviso you hit all your cc)","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-03-15T14:43:47.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nothing shits me more when people throw around such strong terms like \"overpowered\" and \"counter\". if you're actively worrying about whats strong in a current \"meta\" you probably dont have the skills to follow up with those picks and go on to dominate games with them. 99% of all games in OCE, you could win by just playing well with any champ. we're the worst region in the world we have no meta, nothing is meta with us, just play well and stop being such a tryhard until you know wtf you're doing. sorry no, not until you know what you're doing, until you're 18, and OTHERS KNOW that you know what you're doing","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-03-15T09:44:27.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nautilus is meta","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-03-15T09:23:34.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How is Nautilus underplayed doe. \n\nAnd it's definitely Vel'Koz, catches everyone off guard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"you me","date":"2016-03-15T09:21:45.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on the elo really.
