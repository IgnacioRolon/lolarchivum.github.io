I think i good way to change his kit is to make his ult kinda like  a galio ult thing but its his q and ult combined. This way his q can be a short-dash ability for mobility or just a skill for damage and survivability. Does this sound reasonable?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-01-14T14:51:39.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is absolutely nothing wrong with Aatrox, if anything he's probably **too** oppressive. \nHeres my last 2 games as him:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Yysuq\nhttps://imgur.com/a/j2nGu\n\n\nHe's not easy, you have to know his exact limitations off by heart if you want to play him effectively.

Then later on when Lee Sin happens to be wrecking your team in bot lane instead of hunting you, and you are able to sneak a few marks, they don't actually feel useful anymore.\nThen you abandon marks altogether and just build straight up crit-ADC, and spend the last 10 mins of the game doing someone else's job, but just not as well because you don't have the CS they do.\n\nThe old marks had a definitive strength, \n**[one mark = more % damage.]**\nthe new marks are all over the show \n**[one mark = some extra numbers on a couple of abilities, oh and if you get 3 of them you get a range increase, oh but actually the range increase only matters when its the first 4 marks, after that it's every 3 marks and its much less of an increase, hardly worth worrying about, oh and unless you get like 20 marks you still wont be up to Caitlin's level.]**\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \n\nAlso, why does she need more range? She's a close range duelist-marksman. \nAlso her only CC for an engage (E) is also a low target execute. So is she supposed to sacrifice her engage to get more damage, or sacrifice her damage so she can actually do a jungler's job?\n\nHer kit doesn't make sense.\n\nIm probably going to make a proper post about this, just to prod Riot a little. so they remember she actually exists, and probably should have priority over pumping out new emotes.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-15T07:45:55.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't read the wall of text post from Fitzky, but {{champion:266}}  is lethal in the right hands.\n\nIt's like someone playing  {{champion:64}} for the first time, in a competitive match against decent players and getting owned, then saying \"this champ sucks brah\".\n\nSome champions are easy to learn, others take practice.","replies":[{"poster":"KingGoat","date":"2018-01-17T13:55:30.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe its just im new with aatrox and that im bad.

If you take lethal tempo then fill your blood well up to 3 bars, all you have to do is E + Q into a team fight and ult and you'll have an insane amount of attack speed. I've been able to tear apart the enemy team and wipe most of them out doing this. His abilities seem fine the only thing I hate is his blood well and it's interaction with the rest of his abilities. I don't like the playstyle of having to farm up 3 bars beforehand then getting a short \"adrenaline rush\" which works pretty much the same as his ultimate with Ad instead of attack range. This kind of playstyle is forcing Aatrox to either be an assassin, which wipes the enemy out before his \"adrenaline rush\" ends, or a tank, which sustains long enough to keep the \"adrenaline rush\" going. This isn't ideal because Aatrox is meant to be a bruiser. His abilities are fine in working that way, but the whole blood well and building up stacks needs to change. If they want Aatrox to be a sustained fighter that works well in long fights like Jax does, they need to build the blood well solely around champions, as in, it ONLY works and interacts when fighting enemy champions. Unfortunately I haven't been able to come up with any \"new\" ideas but here's something I can propose which kind of combines old and new Aatrox:\n\nQ,W, and E are changed so they only fill up the blood well when used on enemy champions, 20% each still.\nEach 20% of the blood well (or 1 bar) increases Aatrox's attack speed by 10%.\nAt 5 stacks (or 100% filled blood well) Aatrox gains double attack speed (50% -> 100%) for 5 seconds, he can still retain the 5 stacks from fighting champions but the bonus attack speed remains at 50%.\nOf course in order for him to gain the 100% attack speed bonus again he would have to leave combat and lose stacks as it only activates when he initially hits 5 stacks, so this way it's fair.\nThis would also give opponents a good time to react since Aatrox can no longer build up stacks before a fight and instead can only have 2 stacks (40% attack speed) as he enters a team fight with his E + Q. BUT, the 40% attack speed, along with lethal tempo and his ult, would still provide Aatrox with enough attack speed to fill up the rest of his blood well quickly.\n\nWith these changes Aatrox won't be forced to build BOTRK and PD in order to have a decent amount of attack speed and he can opt with going straight for Ad and lifesteal like his old builds. He won't be doing insane amounts of damage since his passive no longer gives him extra Ad when he hits 5 stacks, just an attack speed steroid, which I think is better IMO considering how his W is based around every 3 auto's.","replies":[{"poster":"KingGoat","date":"2018-01-17T13:48:34.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ill try this out.
