Once it went  through the files it, re-opened the game and the game started loading. I get pumped even though I was level 1. Then is crashes before getting into game (on the loading screen). So i let it scan through the files (again it was automatic). Then it does that 1 more time so i thought there was come code that broken or something so i closed the game and decided to restart the laptop that i play on. After coming back I see I have a &quot;leave buster&quot; and im annoyed because I dont deserve the damn time to wait before queue if it wasnt my fault that the game crashed multiple times. I&#039;m really frustrated.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-18T01:34:58.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the late reply.\n\nTry running a **client repair** through settings (the gear icon top right) > Initiate Full Repair.
