So iget toxic and then I get banned for &quot;unsportmanlike&quot; like why the actual fuck do I get that when a guy bans a tank which we didnt even have. So fucking sad","replies":[{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2018-03-23T11:34:05.859+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"you got banned because you acted like a child after you didn't get your way.\n\n\nyou lost your pick, is the other guy a dick? sure.

I think it might be because I'm bronze 1. But like why. It's like a team game but thne your team doesnt play it and bans your champ?\n\nWhich would make your team suffer as the rammus was going to be tank, and we didn't have a tank at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-03-25T12:20:56.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People are allowed to ban whatever they want. They are either dicks or maybe they have a reason. For example if our team's jungler is 4th/5th pick and is hovering Master Yi, and they are not communicating, sometimes I will ban that. Not to be a dick. Just so that the enemy team cannot get him first.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-03-23T14:49:00.098+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot gehrin has said they're banning people that are classified as \"kind of a dick\" so the other guy should have got banned too if this is what you're saying.\n\nRiot doesn't have anything for people who do shit like this and it's always the victim who cops it because they've more vocal about it and confront the fucker about it in-game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-03-23T11:45:52.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I played with this sort of people before.
