So my team builds random things and not having any map awareness meaning when I'm trying to hold them off a tower I have to try and 2-3 v 5 ( depending on who has a brain). Making it much harder for me to try and hold them off while tanking and not having enough damage.\n\nOn the brightside I've tried Dark Harvest and it works well for me. I powerfarm until hitting level 6 allowing me to gank with ult and build dark harvest faster by having succesful ganks. Also whenever I ping when I'm coming for gank the laner most of the times just stays back and I end up being cc'ed and killed. This way I can still have enough damage so my ganks are better.\n\nBut that is because it normal (Draft and Blind). That will most likely change when I get into ranked.\n\nThanks for the feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-02-05T11:08:14.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"goldythefish36","date":"2018-02-05T11:23:04.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just read this and it really helped me, I didn't really think about it that way. And it's most likely because of how new I am to the game. I decided to have a go with Lethal Tempo I found it very effective early game especially if I can get a laner to come and invade a champ that has \"weak\" clears, and or needs to \"power farm\" until level 6.\n\nThere is this one scenario where I ask for an invade onto blue buff (top side, against Kayn) luckily he ended up being there but he had fellow summoners we traded 2 for 1 us being in favour (me dying). And one of the reasons we were able to get the kill on the Kayn was because of the extra attack speed. Maybe PTA would've been better. But that's what happened to me.\n\nI won't nag you anymore I just want to know what you think about Lethal Tempo as you gain attack speed and being allowed to go over the hardcap?\n\nEdit, I also saw that he had Dark Harvest, and thought that on Kayn (as you mentioned) \"bursty assasin\" being why I asked for the invade to try and not let him build stacks easily or for free.\n\nThanks, and I really appreciate how you wrote to make it more understandable for me.\n\n~goldy","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-02-05T11:38:07.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lethal tempo is okay, realistically warwick can use pretty much anything in the precision tree, and lethal tempo works pretty well if they're dumb enough you let you whale on them with autos.\n\nAlso glad to help.\n\n\nop.gg is a good place to start if you want to know what to build and what runes are good, though it's aimed more at the gold plat region in terms of builds, and so often if something seems more like it fits the kit of the champion and their strengths, it may be fine to take in pre-lvl30, bronze, silver and gold.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-02-05T11:33:23.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"aftershock and fleetfootwork are sleeper op on warwick, whereas press the attack is by far the highest winrate keystone, since it is easy to proc and good for warwicks beatdown gamestyle, whilst also providing some burst.\n\nDark harvest isn't good on Warwick because the rune is overall quite weak on champions that can't maximally exploit the rune such as shaco, kayn, rengar or khazix., and even then the rune see stiff competition. To exploit dark harvest, you need to have a very fast clearspeed, high mobility and target access such as stealth, blinks, camo or long range dashes on short cds, and a necessity to perform a full unload of your entire kit on a single target within an extremely short time frame. \nIt's an assassin rune that most assassins don't even take, and strangely enough it actually has very poor scaling due to it's increasing damage often falling behind the defensive stats squishies begin picking up from base stats and some more defensive itemisation choices.\n\nSimply put, dark harvest is overrated, after preseason we realised it wasn't great after they nerfed it's starting damage, and it's really really not good on warwick.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-02-04T13:14:59.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"for warwick I'd suggest either Fleet Footwork (better against immobile carries if you run the triforce fighter type builds), Aftershock (good in balanced comps and helps if they have a frontline, works well with tankier builds), Unsealed Spellbook (if you plan on splitpushing or flanking and playing for lategame map pressure) or Glacial Augment (if you need to counter a splitpusher or you plan on alot of skirmishing, provides alot of extra sticking power but is largely replaceable with a frozen gauntlet).\n\nAftershock is probably the best option overall and outside of niche situations, and Fleet Footwork is good for smurfs.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-02-05T11:19:13.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also press the attack is nice for dueling, and is easily proc'd by warwick's combo.

And so far I have watched a lot of videos about improving working with your team and such. But whenever I look on map I see no one responds to my pings. And if I build tank with warwick I cannot output enough damage to atleast try and carry.\n\nI know that this will most likely change when I hit level 30 (I think that's the level to play ranked). Because people will be checking mini-map, having better map awareness, responding to pings and just better game sense.","replies":[]}]}]}
