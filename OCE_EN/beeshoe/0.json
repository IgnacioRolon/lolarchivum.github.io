Being in silver, I get all the blame of course, doesn't really affect me tho. But what should I do if all lanes lose and I am playing Lee Sin for example?

If I'm playing full tank no damage Nunu i specifically concentrate on nothing but objectives. Keep wards up in between jungles and rivers. You do two things here. 1 you maintain complete dragon control and 2 your wards prevent (hopefully) enemy jungler doing his job, if team watches minimap. Best you can really do in that situation is find the lane that's pushed up the most and gank it. Coordinate with the laner. Again this all matters to what jungler you're playing and the enemy team comp.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Faelaren","date":"2014-12-10T13:42:07.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always found it best to baby sit the lane that is doing well and try to get them rolling and hopefully they can help carry. \n\nThe other thing you can do is clean up or tax the losing lanes to try and transfer more gold on you who you know is doing well. (you will most likely get abused for this so be careful who you do it too)","replies":[]}]}
