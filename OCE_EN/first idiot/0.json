I see that my violations were wrong and that i made the wrong decision. I had a previous 14 day ban and have not learnt from my mistakes. However, i would like to ask Riot for a last chance. After my permanent ban i saw that my actions were unacceptable and i would have to change. I am extremely disappointed in myself and know that i will change and will not be the same person that i was when i received that ban. I realise that the players in the game are real people and that i am hurting them. And that is why i wish to change. I had spent money on my account and put hard work and effort into building it from the ground up. I ask you for another chance which will really change me as a person. I do not want to be like other people and become toxic again. I sincerely apoligise.\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nfirst idiot: bot\r\nfirst idiot: safe\r\nfirst idiot: fk this bot\r\nfirst idiot: fk\r\nfirst idiot: lost again\r\nfirst idiot: fk\r\nfirst idiot:

that in the 14-day ban reform card it is explicitly stated that \"If [your] behaviour continues, your account will be permanently suspended\", and that there are 3 games worth of chat logs here, I ask you, what makes this time different? The permanent suspension should have been no surprise.\n\nWhat I can tell you, is that punishments will never be removed or reduced unless they are made in error. A permanent suspension is permanent, and there is no way for you to recover this account. While I commend the decision to reform, it is too late for this account, though you aren't in any way restricted from creating a new one.\n\nStill, if you'd like to appeal through official channels you can do so through player support, but I wouldn't be getting your hopes up.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"Bagerklestyne","date":"2019-04-08T07:10:53.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Given I had an account perma for me ranting about voip software being rubbish in chat, I wouldn't expect much...

As for auto or manual, I don't know, that process is intentionally obfuscated.\n\nFor gameplay or chat punishments, you have to have received at least a 14-day ban before being issued a permanent suspension first. \n\nThat's not to say exceptions are impossible, but we're talking things like serious threats, or other things that would be \"escalate to local authorities\" worthy.

However, it is not mandatory - players can receive a permanent suspension even if there are no previous restrictions in some particular cases.
