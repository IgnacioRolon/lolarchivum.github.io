It's a great idea. I also know you're having trouble getting people to make the switch from blind pick. \r\n\r\nYou have to realise that most people don't know what champ they want before they go into a blind pick and  some people want to see what team they have before they make a choice.\r\n\r\nSolution-\r\n1. Make a fill option, allow people to join teams that are only short one role and allow them to pick a champ and fill that role. This speeds up que times for everyone and I think you'll find that you'll get a much larger response than first thought. \r\n2. Allow people to pick a role without having to select a champion until they're in a team. Still give them the option to do that from the get go, but allow them to make an educated decision based on their team. \r\n\r\nI'm no expert, but I think with this change we can really bring team builder out of blind picks shadow. \r\n\r\nPS: The lack of draft pick is disgusting but I can't think of a reasonable way of including it in team builder.\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers guys <3","replies":[]}
