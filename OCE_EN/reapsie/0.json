REMOVE the chat.","subforum":"Player Behaviour","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I&#039;ve been playing since season 2 and I don&#039;t think the player base has ever been more toxic than this. Games just feel like flipping a coin. It doesn&#039;t matter how well you do... you just have to have the least flaming or inting team. You can&#039;t even be sportsmanlike or helpful because the moment you get them typing, people will start flaming each other. Doesn&#039;t matter what you type. Just get them talking to each other and the win rate is going to drop. So there&#039;s literally nothing you can do about it. Can we get some chatless ques or something? \nIf there was no chat, not only would there not be flaming but less people would int because they don&#039;t get a chance to explain that they&#039;re just doing it until they get ganks.\nI know I can mute all, but I wish my team wouldn&#039;t speak to each other either. It would make games more about skill and less about coin flips. It&#039;s WELL WORTH the slight loss of strategic capability. Which lets be honest, it&#039;s almost never used for that.\n\nPlease upvote!","replies":[{"poster":"zEle","date":"2018-06-10T03:12:01.784+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was even falsely accused of bad behavior and got 14day suspension when I was the one who got scolded.
