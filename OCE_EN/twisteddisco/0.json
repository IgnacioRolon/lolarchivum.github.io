Either they get super fed or we get super fed. There are never any REALLY close gripping games where im at. Its just so frustrating how i try my best and we get a huge lead and win easy (nothing learned) or we make some mistakes and they get a huge lead (nothing learned again) \r\n\r\nI have a theory that it might be the shear lack of people on this server. Not enough people to make fair groupings all the time so you get some really good and really bad players all on the same level and they just bring each other down.\r\n\r\nIt cant be luck. And although im not challenger im atleast OKish.. silver at the most\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-08-10T19:23:24.611+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to realise that most of the games aren't one sided because the teams are not evenly matched, they're one sided because people (especially people in bronze) are often very poor at playing from behind and tilt easily, and one small mistake, gank or whatever can easily snowball into a huge advantage for one player or team. Two equally skilled bronze players playing against each other for a bunch of games will not go even every game, most of the time one will end up way ahead of the other. Some guy that goes 10-0 in lane and looks like a god one game could just as easily be 0-10 the next game, even against the same players.\nAlso, you can always learn stuff from games, even the ones that are a stomp one way or the other.","replies":[{"poster":"TwistedDisco","date":"2015-08-10T19:58:57.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats fair. What you describe is my feeling. But surely the players going on tilt, huge advantage ect... is due to the lack of match making? \n\nIt just feels like there is a MASSIVE difference alot of the time.\n And back to feeling like its hard to learn from these experiences. As an example. I gank bot lane. Take out the ADC and support and then go dragon... seems fair enough....\n\nOn one occasion my ADC and support (or just one) follow me and we all do it together.\nOn another occasion no one helps me, i start and then someone just comes and kills me while im trying to solo dragon (when lower level anyways).\n\nSurely basic strat like this and many examples of similar things happening is because there is a gap between alot of the players awareness, skill, knowlege in a single bracket. And the only reason for that (that i can see) is because there arent enough people on the OCE server in my bracket to match up with.\n\nGets me down alot thats all","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-08-10T20:35:47.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People also have very diverse strengths and weaknesses, especially in lower ratings, which can make them look alot better or worse than the rating theyre in. There will be large gaps in skill level, awareness etc regardless of how many people there are. Some people get to silver or gold by being amazing in lane or using some cheese stratgy to get ahead all the time while having absolutely zero map awareness or team play. Other people get to that same rating by having great awareness and setting themselves up fights that they can't possibly mess up even though their mechanics suck or they get behind in lane all the time. Other people might be mediocre at everything but are very flexible in what they play so they allow their teammates to be on their most comfortable roles so they get carried more often. They might also be good at only one role or champion, and do really well (making the matchmaking look unfair) when they get that role/champion, or do really badly (also making the matchmaking look unfair) when they dont get that role/champion. Most people are going to be above average for their rank in some areas and worse in others. I'm almost certain you would find the games to be just as one sided on a much bigger server.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-08-10T20:15:36.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"About the last sentence, hmm, some games are so one sided against me that I literally can not do anything in teamfights with amount of damage and CC a champion can bring.\nThe decision that I often have to make in these uncommon stomp games is to just not join the fight because I know I will just get deleted and not contribute any CC or damage. Of course it depends heavily on the role that I must play in the match, and I take that into account as well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BadLuckFollowsMe","date":"2015-08-12T02:42:27.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hear you man. I changed my name for a reason.\nThe problem is you need to be playing at a skill level higher than where you are to get out of a division, but you can't learn those skills when you're constantly coming up against those 24/0 Yi jungles that your fellow teammates fed. It's a bit of a catch 22.\n\nAll you can really do is watch tip videos, try and find champions you can consistently carry with, and keep throwing your head against that wall. Try to stop at 2 losses so you don't get on tilt. Also, the right music can really improve your day.\n\nIt's like learning to swim by getting thrown in and having 4 other people on top of you. You'll learn eventually, but everything around you is conspiring to make it as hellish as possible, so you just got to grit your teeth and push through.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-08-10T20:16:44.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Low MMR players often play inconsistently and many are only there because the one thing that hinders their learning process is going on tilt/raging.","replies":[{"poster":"TwistedDisco","date":"2015-08-11T19:53:41.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get that, but Low MMR players should still be on the same level.
