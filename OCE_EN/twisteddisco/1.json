Most games and software have a spinning or moving symbol to signal the game is still running. Sometimes i don't know if the game is crashed on me, just taking its time, frozen, or not allowed me into the game at all even though I'm 100% loading.\r\nNot being let into the game after a long wait in the loading screen is probably the most frustrating out of all the bugs. I think a moving icon or something or even a moving bar to signal the game is still loading would be great, hell even a chat option while loading.\r\n\r\nAnother bug is i choose a champion and the lock in button just switches off unless i change champion, change back and then press it. If i lag on the switch back and log in sometimes it will just lock in the champion i DIDENT want purely because the lock in button wouldn't work first time i selected the champion.\r\n\r\nAgain i TOTALLY understand most people play this on PC and I'm sure that works fine but these bugs are actually getting me banned and black marks on my account and i just feel like i CANT progress in the game and it just adds to my stress levels. Anything you can suggest to fix these bugs on my side would be most grateful.\r\n\r\nThanks again\r\nTwistedDisco","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-19T09:23:37.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm on Windows, so I'm probably really limited in what I can do to help.\n\nHave you tried disabling all anti-virus and firewalls while playing?

Because when you move your mouse on the corner it seems to make spells unusable, so **disable hot corners** or stay away from them while playing!","replies":[]}]}
