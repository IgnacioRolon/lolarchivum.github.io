Fix your shitty broken report system, you piece of trash company - too focused on killing your game; can't wait till the day your company is filing for bankruptcy and is forced to close off League of Legends. \n\nHello there,\nso recently I had a ranked match with a jinx adc, who wouldn&#039;t stop flaming me and my teammates. At no point in the chat do I feel like anything I said justified a ban - this jinx said some pretty crude things with no intention all game. At one point, with no background comments around it, she told me to &quot;kill myself&quot; too; yet I&#039;m justified a ban?

Saying things like you're \"gonna carry [someone's] shitty acc [I assume ass?]\", \"stfu\", \"U SPASTIC\", \"u suck mate\" etc is the kind of stuff that will inevitably lead to some form of punishment, particularly when it appears consistently.\n\nI think the real question here is not \"is this punishable\", but rather \"should you have received this particular punishment\", and for that we'd need to consider your punishment history. Basically, I'm fairly confident in saying that if your previous punishment wasn't a 25 game chat restriction (in the case of a 14-day ban) or a 14 day ban (in the case of a permanent ban), then you *might* actually have a viable reason to appeal.\n\nWith that in mind, you need to go to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and submit a ticket (under the category \"*I have a question about a suspension or restriction on my account*\") and take the issue up with them. Bottom line is that if they say it's not a false positive, the ban sticks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-06-07T19:55:33.965+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"*preceeds to copy toxic text*\n\n*Realises it’s all toxic*","replies":[{"poster":"HeathereYyIy","date":"2018-06-08T04:41:33.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"If you think anything I said elicits toxic behaviour and should be on the receiving end of maximum punishment, you're gonna have a hard time dealing with the real world.
