Epic's policy is much more resemblant of a \"0% tolerance\" policy than Riot's has been the entire time LoL has existed. Despite everything that's wrong with Riot and LoL, they're probably going to last another 5 years, *at least*, before enough of the \"loyal player-base\" turns around and decides they've had enough. Even though Epic has it's own MOBA (Paragon), it's still a very distinct style from LoL, and probably not what the majority of Riot's fan-base is going to move onto (they'd be looking more at things like HotS, Battlerite, even DotA, the games that are actually significantly comparable to LoL).\n\nThe thing you're not considering here is that most online games nowadays are doing basically the same thing as LoL, in creating a \"safe-space\" for their players. Believe it or not, they don't want their player-bases to be harassed all the time when they're just tying too have some fun and/or climb the ranks, and in some situations it's the kind of toxic behaviour that could result in legal actions, even against the devs (for example, it's actually illegal in Australia to participate in cyber bullying).\n\nYour entire point of Riot being \"eaten alive\" by Epic is flawed, even when you don't consider that LoL still has several years before it goes belly up.","replies":[{"poster":"HeathereYyIy","date":"2018-06-13T12:16:37.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The likelihood of a nice player being rebutted with insults is quite rare in this game, it's always aggravated by trolls or soft inting players who feel the need to disrupt the match for everyone trying to make a positive contribution to the team. The problem is that Riot do have a flawed report system; never have I seen, outside of League of Legends, cases being examined singularly on the perpetrator, and not through considering the circumstances by which the actions were made. Imagine if the legal law system worked exactly like this - where perpetrators are solely pressed for their effects on situations, with no background information to clarify the actions.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-06-13T12:26:40.694+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeathereYyIy,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=KbMGt8QT,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2018-06-13T12:16:37.743+0000)\n>\n> The problem is that Riot do have a flawed report system;\n\nThat I will not disagree with, Riot *do* have a flawed system, more so than others at least.\n\n> never have I seen, outside of League of Legends, cases being examined singularly on the perpetrator, and not through considering the circumstances by which the actions were made.\n\nThis is where I take issue. As far as my experience, I see it happen all the time in a variety of other online games. That can be reasonably attributed to \"different people have different experiences\", but the thing you need to consider is that just because you see something happening in a specific way doesn't mean that's the status quo, which it seems is what you are implying with that statement (for reference, yes, I have seen the same in cases pertaining to Epic games).\n\nBottom line; basically every developer of every online game, as far as I can tell, uses the same very basic policies to shape their individual report/punishment systems, and as far as I can tell, the whole \"you get judged based on what *you* did wrong\" thing stands for all of them, whether that means they consider the \"triggering motive\" or not.\n\nOne final note:\n> The likelihood of a nice player being rebutted with insults is quite rare in this game\n\nThis is the *top* \"trigger\" I see in-game resulting in toxicity, completely dwarfing every other trigger I've seen to date. Again: different people, different experiences.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FeedMeh","date":"2018-06-12T13:57:50.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They have a loyal base of players that is the foundation to their business model.
