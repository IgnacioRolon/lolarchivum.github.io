Then a big yellow gay thing pops up on the person you're trying to gay in the ass\r\n\r\nI think shorter range or none at all as ganks by Rengar can be countered with a well placed vision ward.  \r\n\r\n2) His Necklace \r\nI think he should get more bonuses from kills, like, armor penetration, more damage, cool down reduction and attack speed on top of his normal bonuses. \r\n\r\n3) His Jungle is not so good unless you get early kills or build tanky \r\nMaybe to help with with his clear times give him a passive on his necklace or q that does more damage vs monsters or something gay like that.\r\nHis w does it why not his q \r\n\r\nOther than these small things Rengar is the best in my book and riot did a great job when creating him. When I play him you feel like a hunter. Every time I find a game and I click on Rengar and he says \"Tonight We Hunt\" I get a hard on.","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-03-11T04:48:17.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"R34 hype.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-03-11T02:16:49.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah fair enough really but its just so frustrating you know? idk I guess im used to FPS games mostly where cloaking/stealthing is 90% effective.\n\nits not really a *bad* decision, just a very very ***very*** irritating feeling.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-03-10T15:48:11.384+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"Are you drunk?\n\n1) The ! above champs heads should not be changed at all.\n\n2) His necklace provides ridiculous free stats why the hell would they make it broken by giving it things like AD and armor pen?
