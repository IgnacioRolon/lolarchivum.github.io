However none of that translates into the game at all, he&#039;s just some bird enthusiastic half arsed lane bully. If i hadn&#039;t read the lore i&#039;d of assumed he was Quinn&#039;s father.\nIn my mind Swain should be like Viktor with less burst with some inspiration of Azir he should be this commanding control mage forcing his opponent into less favourable positions kind of like what tahliya tries to achieve with her W and E but more of on a team fight level. Right now he's just some Bird-human hybrid that tries to brute force his way into low range skirmish's then uses zhonyas and retreats when is low.\n\nEdit: i'd like to add that when swain is strong it's not the healthy kind of strong he more or less just Bullies his opponents to the point where they have to sit a full screen away. I must admit i've gotten a few lucky swain top games under my belt where i sit at level 13 or so in lane against a level 8 opponent.\n\nWhat about you guys? :)","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-10-13T01:43:52.361+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally as much as I love {{champion:80}} I would put him to receive that rework. His kit is unhealthy to play against and the only real counterplay is to become his lane bitch till mid-late game. When he's fed he is really really strong, but when late game comes it just falls off the face of the earth which never ever feels good. His kit is centric on him playing like an assassin but requires him to build tank to remain effective which is a bit odd in some ways. \n\nWhat would be nice is that Riot would be able to more closely capture that Spartan imagery. If they kept a single ability exactly as is, they should keep his ult.","replies":[{"poster":"Trustworthy","date":"2016-10-13T02:55:42.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \nI have a love hate relationship with pantheon too.

His flight synergizes perfectly with his q, his passive is the core of his gameplay, reflected in his expansion. His ultimate makes for a great defence against pesky melee champions, also allowing for thoes long ranged snipes and aoe burst damage. Actually, his aoe is probably the strongest part of his kit. His passive tears through teams if you position just right, his q can stun multiple people if used right, and his ult's crazy scaling. He is quite hard to master, for sure. But if he clicks for you, he can be one of the best champions to play. \n\nAlso, tip for the q. You don't always have to reactivate it, you can use the limit on the q to pop it. Don't q every time you fly. The q is easier to ise while kiting backwards. And often times it is not a good idea to do thw flying q combo, due to its inaccuracy, its more of a situational move.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-10-13T03:03:27.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aatrox i love that shitty guy.","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-10-13T09:18:54.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NO YOU LEAVE MY HOMEDEMON ALONE","replies":[{"poster":"Trustworthy","date":"2016-10-13T23:27:13.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to disagree besides his initial Cheese-style early game, He has low Dmg for a mellee carry thats ment to be offset by his crazy sustain but executioners calling is such an easy buy and morello's being bread and butter for most mages he dosen't really get to shine these days. His Ult is really cool Extra Attack Range and attack speed to help him sorta stick but His E and i hate to say it his Q are really bland. Aatrox should have something in his Kit like True lifesteal based on enemy's Missing health the more blood is split in battle the more he thrives.

With a kit that's so 'underpowered' as his, this shouldn't be a thing, surely? He's sleeper OP for anyone who knows how to play him properly and capitalise upon opportunities.","replies":[{"poster":"Trustworthy","date":"2016-10-15T02:53:45.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what i can determine from the Data his overall win rate is 47.47% with the player base average games on him being 70 odd. On the Oceanic server he has a 46% win rate, No one is saying he's useless he's just mediocre at best in the hands of his average player. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if there is an Aatrox main with 400+ games on a 70% win rate. But him being Over or underpowered is irrelevant thats not what the thread is discussing. His Kit dosen't reflect a being who is as ancient as war itself the point i was getting at my above post is that Aatrox should thrive the longer he is in battle instead of being harshly countered Mid-Late game as he's burst isn't high enough and he lacks the tools to stick to conventional carries and toplaners. His Cheese-style early game with Huge burst and tower diving capabilities can break a game open don't get me wrong i just wish he had a Kit that reflected his personality and was more functional is all.\nPossibly taking a page from Tryndamere (the tryndamere we know today was created by aatrox) Darius or Jax. The longer these champs are in battle the more lethal they are. Tryndamere's fury Ramping up his Dmg and Crit chance, Huge DPS increase to darius with up to 200 AD and 6 stacks of bleed and jax who gains tons of attackspeed a 3 strike DPS increase. Aatrox just gains Sustain every 3rd strike or Dmg the longer he is in battle with more attackspeed in his passive but the sad thing is the rest of his Kit dosen't have enough Raw power for you to get away with just using the healing part of his W but if you don't you'll die far to quickly, the intended purpose of this was aatrox was supposed to stay @ 50% health unless CC'd and nuked down but with Executioners and Morello's but such easy buys he dosen't get a chance it's all or nothing and judging by the data it's nothing a little to often.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SteelHD","date":"2016-10-13T02:45:50.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would totally go for {{champion:266}} as when I first started playing this game he looked totally badass, but when I delved into the actual gameplay he was this guy with a clunky diver kit that doesn't really fit with his lore. \n\nI think it would be great if his ult did something to help his allies (a bit like a {{champion:15}} ult) that would fit with his theme a whole lot better","replies":[{"poster":"Trustworthy","date":"2016-10-13T02:53:45.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah my top 3 where Swain Aatrox and Irelia","replies":[{"poster":"SteelHD","date":"2016-10-13T05:06:54.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Irelia's ult just feels so anticlimactic lol.
