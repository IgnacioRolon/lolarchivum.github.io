Was never really an issue though because it wasn&#039;t an often done strategy as simple as it is, but seems to be really common lately.

In the past the passive would be worth around 620g, now days it's 390g.\n\nAlso the alternatives aren't as good IMO. Sterak's gives better stats if you include the passive, but unlike GA it doesn't allow your team to re-position around your \"death\" to protect you when you're back up.\n\nI think raising the cost a little and removing the percentage healing (so it doesn't favour tanks), would put it back in it's place as a decent item that has many trade-offs.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-28T02:06:10.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel the issue isn't with tanks buying GA, though it does make them irritating to kill. I feel the real issue with bruisers and assassins buying GA. A Sion with GA is kind of like, who cares? But a tank Ekko with GA is a nightmare. Irelia, Riven, Diana, Jax, ect... with GA feels impossible to stop if they get ahead and the more tanky bruisers like darius, garen, Zac, Gragas with ga just feel like more effort that it's worth trying to kill them. Assassins with GA just feel so cancerous for adcs too, since that 8-0 khazix, Fizz or Zed now not only can 100-0 you with pretty much no counterplay, but now, even if they fuck up, they'll still kill you. Ashe with GA isn't really all that much of an issue, you catch her out and she's dead, GA or no GA. But a Zed with GA will come up and revive with 30% hp, kill your adc and then maybe even get away if you don't have someone with reliable hard cc on your team. \n\nMaking the healing a flat numerical (scaling off level for instance) healing would just dramatically increase it's effectiveness on assassins (making the issue even worse and further heightening this assassin meta I so loathe), stay about the same for mages, increase it's effectiveness a little for ADC so I mean that's nice (but they'd still have to deal with more assassins), decrease it's effectiveness a little for bruisers (so I guess that's good) and make it useless for cc based tanks (who don't really have a good reason to buy it anyways).","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-09-28T06:09:52.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a support I can usually peel most assassins off after GA (timing hooks as they spawn such that it is un-dodgeable helps), but I totally understand what you mean about **Fizz** {{champion:105}} XD That little bastard...","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-28T12:47:17.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well that's all well and good if we support mains are near enough to peel off the assassin if we picked a cc heavy support, but often (especially in lower elo) teams don't have nearly enough cc and so when the support isn't present there isn't really a way to peel the assassins off the adc or lock them down.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-09-29T04:32:06.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Guardian angel takes up an item slot while only providing some armour and magic resist outside of its passive. Really, the only useful thing about is the passive unless you are for some reason in dire need of mixed resistances since it takes the place of an offensive item or another defensive item. Both teams can purchase the item and when the passive activates there's always a chance you'll just die immediately again despite regaining 30% of your health/mana and placing it on a 5 minute cooldown where you still die anyways.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-09-28T04:19:56.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"limiting items to 1 per team is only going to create fights.\n\nbut seriously more than 1 {{item:3512}}  is fucking more annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-28T04:27:58.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and then add a banner of command and maybe a heimerdinger or jax and you won't ever be able to leave a lane unchecked.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-28T01:33:40.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"GA is an overall bad item outside of extremely lategame teamfights due to it's average stats and the long cooldown on it's passive and the fact that the 30% hp and stasis make it not very good without someone to save your ass after you come out of ga reviving. However, it's good for playing hard and trying to close the game early or really late in the game in teamfights and it's extremely useful for hyper carries who can lead to victory or defeat depending on whether they die and how aggressive they can play and put damage out. Overall tanks really won't find much use for GA nor utility supports (maybe pokey squishy utility supports like sona) it works best on bruisers, Assassins and Damage carries. Also forcing the team to only have 1 GA is going to cause chaos in soloq and the item is kinda situational anyway. It helps stop throws but it also takes up an item slot and uses alot of gold and for ap assassins in particular, zhonias is a far superior item.","replies":[]}]}
