Things were going great until we hit the Exile5 vs Tainted Minds match.  The engineering team is going to resolve it, but we couldn't risk touching the system until the other leagues had completed their matches.\n\nSorry about the delay, I let you guys down on this one.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2017-01-21T22:02:15.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait didn't they update it to fix it like 2 years ago?\n\nAlso, watch them on youtube then, they are usually on there somewhere and unspoiled.","replies":[{"poster":"BolshieColt","date":"2017-01-28T05:48:08.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeh thats true, but what i love about the VOD page is that it has 3 links on every match for each game, so you dont know if a series ended after game 2.
