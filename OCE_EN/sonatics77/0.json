Now they&#039;ve also removed rerolling, you have to disenchant a LOT of shards just to upgrade one. So the only way to QUICKLY get champions (quickly as in not 5 years wait) is to spend RP which, will be good for Rito, but for the average player, not so much.\nThis pretty much forces people to use RP which should be optional and you should be able to easily progress in game without spending money. \nFeelsbadman{{item:3070}} \n\nUpvote if you want the old IP system back.\n\nEdit1: I'm not saying remove everything about the new system, keep the unlimited levels and the rewards for leveling up, but keep the old currency system.

Old system I get a new champion within a week.\n\nPersonally, I've not found this kind of difference between the old system and the new. I don't play LoL as much now (over the past year or two) as I did prior to that. Over the past month, I'd played a reasonable amount to go through the missions related to recent events (Pool Party, for example). In that time, I've managed to get from about ~6K BE to ~14.5K on my main, and from ~5K to ~10K on my smurf (though currently sitting at ~7.5K because I bought Gangplank). At *that* rate, I could easily earn one champion per month per account, or one champion per fortnight to put it more simply. If I were to play 6+ hours per day, I could double that rate easy, giving me, on average, one champion per week, and that's even considering that I keep more than a few of the champion shards I get on my smurf as I don't own the champs or already have a shard for them.\n\nif you're only getting ~100BE per level, including what the champ shards could be disenchanted for, then that's a *big* deviation from the average (910BE per level), and honestly you might want to consider contacting Support to find out if it's bugged/glitched and/or not working properly for you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hattani","date":"2017-11-09T21:58:10.226+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it'd be a good idea as well to add some BE as a reward for finishing a match. In my opinion, it feels that the rewards from the new system are a bit delayed where you need to wait for an extra level if you are just 20 BE off a champ you desire in order to purchase it. I like how the old system allowed for instantaneous rewards where you could buy the champion you were thinking about playing all day as soon as you had enough IP. Its sort of turned into a kind of lootbox way of earning in game currency that tended to alienate me from other games that had that type of in game currency system. In addition, i'm not exactly happy with the idea that I need to disenchant the shard that I obtained in my loot box in order to get BE. Before, I could get a crate and save the shard while disenchanting any other shards I didn't want, while at the same time earning for a specific champ I wanted with IP from matches at the same time. I am not sure if i'm making sense but in other words, its like I was able to actively earn currency (IP) for a champ that I specifically desired while also earning BE from any chests that I got to unlock the champion shard I had in my loot. But now its as if I need to not only wait to get a chest which is my only source of ingame currency but I also \"NEED\" to disassemble anything that I even get from the chest to actually get enough blue essence to buy the champ from the store. Before I could have gotten both, 1 immediately with IP and one over time by building up blue essence. A suggestion for this would be to provide BE after every game in order to eliminate the need to disenchant every shard you get in order to obtain BE and that would enable us to both buy champs from the store with BE and unlock the champs given to us by the capsules from leveling up using the BE we earned in matches. Using this method, it gives the shards value by allowing us to purchase champs at a discounted price without needing to disenchant them to get in game currency, and we can also buy the specific champs that we desire immediately. Technically this would work tying both the loot and the ingame currency reward system by making both valuable as I read was the goal of the rework. I understand that we may be earning around the same BE as IP as before but the problem is we are sharing this BE with the loot system which before had its own currency. In other words, its slower than before to really unlock champions because we can't exactly keep the shards if we want to earn BE so we have to disenchant them. Before we could earn 1 champ passively (BE) and 1 champ actively (IP).

Why would they add this new system to the game? What would be the point of it.\n\nThis is easy to answer without going into the \" RIOT WANTS MONEY FRAG EVERYONE!! \" \nWhat they have done from a business point of view not consumers. Is to offer a product that wasn't needed nor wanted by the consumer. \nThat is XP boost and IP boost.\n\nOnly time I have ever gotten either was when I got banned and leveling a new account. I would buy a 3 day XP boost and a 7 day IP boost. \nThis would allow me to level a new account and have more then enough IP to get everything I need to enter rank and start all over again from where I left off. But in saying this after I achieved being able to join rank and so on I never looked at a IP boost or XP boost again.\nI would just grind ARAM if I needed some fast IP to get a champion I wanted or join a few normal's with a mate and end games with 15 mins or so and go again. There was no need for any boost in anyway.\n\nNow with the new system we have.. XP boost is more of must have thing. Sure you can grind out the levels going by Riot [here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/Jh3Mtzu6-board-post-title-blue-essence-earn-rates-learning-the-numbers-with-carl-and-henrietta) but that is going the long way about it.\n\nWhere before hand. If you were 30 and only paid for skins.. What would be the point of XP boost or IP boost right? You are 30 and it is capped at 30 so really buying a XP boost would be a waste of money. IP Boost at 30 would be helpful some what but really not worth the money if you only play rank and not willing to grind normal's endlessly.\n\nSo removing the level cap and offering a reward and saying \" Every 10 levels you get some epic stuff \" this makes you more willing or even wanting of that XP boost to get to level 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 and so on. Just to see what epic stuff you get.\n\nThis creates another issue in it's self. No one I know has made it to 40 yet. I haven't seen any post about what you get at 40 or even 50. Then the other issue is when you hit 100.. Is that classified as really epic achievement? Do you get EPIC EPIC EPIC LOOTS!. Since so many of them are remaining unanswered it creates a lot of unknown.\n\nLike before when I said I got 200 BE from 30 to 31. It was due to the champion I saw at the time of my uncertainty about the new loot system that a champion disenchant into 200 BE. Which I will say was very unnerving to me and I felt as thou I was ripped off for the work I did.\n\nBut this in it's self is becoming the most talked about issue on the forums. Even if I do the math and Riot does the math. The unseen out come of the new system and people seeing they got a capsule and they got 3 champions and then it disenchants for 810 BE { Which I just happen to me btw } people don't feel like they are being rewarded.\nEven if you say \" The maximum daily limit on IP was 900 \" people see.. I could have gotten 900. Not 810 and then on top of that I have a chance to get 700.. I am worst off by 200 IP a day. \n\nThis isn't really the best thing for this system right off the bat. You should have made it more rewarding at the start to allow people to get on board with it and said something like \" Since it is a new system we have made it so you get better then normal loots. This is only for a limited time or until you get to level 35 after that the loot system will be based around this \" \nThat would help and allow people to understand the unseen part of it easier.\n\nLets face it. Riot loves chance. Every game you play is a game chance.. If you win or lose it is all chance. When I level a new account and buy some RP. The first thing I do is buy boxes. \nNormally 11 boxes sometimes I buy more. But I like to chance it on boxes because I am not worried about what I unlock as long as I feel I got my money's worth.\n\nIf I unlock boxes and all they have is skins and I cannot use any. I do not feel as thou I was ripped. I feel as thou it was a crappy box.\nCome next week if I have enough cash left over after paying all the bills I will get another set of boxes.\n\nBUT Capsules have a random aspect in which I did not choose. In fact it has been pushed upon me and taken away the ability to unlock champions until a set amount of time has past.\nSure you can speed this timer up by buying these gems. Sorry I was thinking of a mobile game just then... Hang on? No I am not. \n\nIf I buy a XP boost.. I can speed up this timer between capsules and get bonus loot because I got 40 faster and so on. \nSo from a customer point of view this is what is going on. League has become a mobile game.\nOnly difference is the fact I can play endless games and I don't have to wait out a timer before I get another life or so on to play the game again.\nBut I have a wait timer on when I can or cannot buy a champion unless I pay for the timer to be skipped.\n\n2. Offering BE at the end of every game.\n\nThis can be good and bad. The first issue is how much BE is fair? Then the level up system would have to be removed or you get more BE then you should for input vs reward.\nBut if they only gave 25 BE every game you played for a win and 5 BE for loss we are back at the start again fighting over the new system and fairness.\n\nI would like to see BE after every game. But I also like the leveling reward system. But once again it is the randomness of the capsules I do not like at all. \nThe fact that capsules is the only way for me to get BE makes me worry more about BE then I ever worried about IP. This makes me worry about the value I get from the capsules. Sure I can buy the XP boost which Riot is hoping I will buy. Which { lets face it here} is a good business decisions but I just don't want to have to go that route to be able to achieve what I would achieve in the old system by seeing the growth of IP. \n\nBut because I haven't gotten to 40 yet and because I haven't seen anyone showing what they have gotten at 40 I cannot really say what is needed or what isn't needed.\nBut I can say.. The randomness of the capsules are unwanted and something like a free champion pick needs to be added. You could add in the mystery champion shard for players that do like the random chance of this and that.. But something needs to be added to reduce the amount of unseen and chance's of the capsules.\n\nBut I am just a random player in league with my own idea on what should happen. What I think should or shouldn't happen doesn't always work out as a great business decisions.{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vegathron","date":"2017-11-10T04:15:34.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"please dont, the community is dumb XD","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EXOLISHER","date":"2017-11-08T06:47:05.607+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I MESSED UP BIG TIME!\n\nI just saw this now because I wasn't earning BE.

Right now we're working on another boards post where we'll reveal the full details of the new leveling curves and how it compares to the old system. Not just handpicked anecdotes, but charts showing the whole leveling curve for players of all types (average players, the top engagers, all that stuff). We'll talk about leveling from 1-30, and we'll show the very detailed leveling curves all the way up into the highest levels in the system.\nThe post might take a couple of days at most to get out, because we're currently looking at some early tweaks we can make to address some of the feedback we've gotten. We'll talk about some of those in that post as well. I'll come back and update this post with a link to it once it's live. And obviously I'll keep posting here as I get the time. The reason we're here reading and engaging in all these posts is because we want to learn how players are reacting to the system. We knew stuff would be crazy (as it always is when you put a new system into the hands of millions of people) so this was always going to be the process.
