I&#039;m not even smart enough to do the whole modding thing, I had to google what it even was. I went to log in today to get a horrible pop up telling me I&#039;ve been permanently banned for the use of &quot;botting&quot;. I hadn&#039;t logged in for about a week and have no idea how this even happened. I&#039;m freaking out, I spent a good sum of money on champs and skins and so I&#039;m really upset and don&#039;t know how to fix this, I&#039;m completely innocent here. Please some one help me.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-02-07T03:49:10.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submit a ticket to player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nThey'll be able to offer you more details on the punishment, and if the punishment was a result of compromise, start you on the account recovery process.","replies":[]}]}
