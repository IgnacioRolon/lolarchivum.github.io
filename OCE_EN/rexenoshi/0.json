Note please only add me if you do voice chat . I&#039;ve been playing league now for 4 years i&#039;m not the greatest player . But I have a great understanding of champions, builds, team coordination/ fights , objective control and farming.  Looking  for Normal and Ranked players . I currently haven&#039;t ranked this year and the highest i have achieved is silver 2. That being said i don&#039;t ranked as much as i probably should. Ranked frustrates me for a number of reasons, but the biggest one is people not taking it seriously or going afk or trolling which i&#039;m sure most of you reading this would understand these frustrations. So  i much prefer to play norms but with some good friends who encourage each other and make it fun regardless of win or loss as long as we try our best and have fun, im more then happy to rank with you, if you fit this description.  On a final note If you do decide to add me please let me know you added me from here so we can exchange voice communication details.  Till our paths meet see you on the rift for glory ... lol :D {{champion:122}} Recently changed name for anyone still interested in adding me it's now RexeNoshi ","replies":[{"poster":"ZSoldierKill","date":"2017-06-17T06:03:36.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"JoeShwar was not found lol","replies":[{"poster":"RexeNoshi","date":"2017-06-29T13:14:17.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Had a name change i forgot about this forum post as i have had quite a few people recently add me sorry if this messed you around","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jonnyeps","date":"2017-06-17T04:16:31.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey dude!\n\nI cant find you? lets hook up :D","replies":[{"poster":"RexeNoshi","date":"2017-06-29T13:13:06.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"soz man recently changed my name","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RexeNoshi","date":"2017-06-29T13:12:27.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Recently have had a name change to anyone still wishing to add me its now RexeNoshi","replies":[]},{"poster":"pedojuice","date":"2017-06-11T07:05:54.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"game with friend ?","replies":[{"poster":"RexeNoshi","date":"2017-06-11T07:33:26.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not quite sure i understand the question.
