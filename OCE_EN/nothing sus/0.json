I can&#039;t speak for other champs but I play liss and she burns through her mana so quickly and if you even miss one skill you can get messed up. I no longer care if my account is banned I wont be spending any more money on this game and have now just accepted its going to be a loss of 300+ dollars on skills and champs and server moving. \n\nI wont be playing the game any more and I am going to uninstall it right now before the updates this game was good fun now all it does is make me upset hitting people with skills some times does not do any damage enemys been able to cast their ult after been stunned.\n","replies":[]}
