I can&#039;t change internet services either, all help would be appreciated. {{item:3070}}\n\n-Yup!

Low priority queue is your warning sign that you should really prioritize fixing these stability issues as they are causing problems for other people too.\n\nAs I mentioned in the initial reply, there are lots of steps you can take to try and resolve this and I'd strongly encourage you to try some of them.  If you ignore the problem, it is likely you will find yourself in low priority queues again in the future.\n\nI hope this helps you understand why this system exists, but please do feel free to ask any more questions if you have them.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Shilica","date":"2015-07-13T04:03:35.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is another problem as i stated in my discussion topic, when i leave the game and try to reconnect once my internet is completely fine it won't let me reconnect at all, even though my internet connection is fine, how do I fix that? because this has only been happening since the recent patch.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-07-13T04:15:07.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I'm reading this right, you have cases where your internet briefly disconnects and reconnects?
