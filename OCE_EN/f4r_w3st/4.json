Ultimately PBE is about feedback, and streamers by nature give feedback because they are generally talking over their gameplay. Not to mention the chat.\n\nGetting those streamers through first not only means more players overall are exposed to the content (audiences), it's also an easy way to guarantee a wide spectrum of feedback from the small percentage of players that can actually get in.\n\nLet's be honest, most of the people queueing for TFT right now aren't doing it because they want to provide in-depth and considered feedback or even regular old bug reports. They just want to play it ASAP, which is not the purpose of the test server.","replies":[{"poster":"Outis","date":"2019-06-25T03:17:01.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"let's be real, it's a lot more to do with advertising your new game then feedback reasons... they are entering a new game market and aggressively competing with other games of the same genre. of course it's for free advertising and hype. nothing necessarily wrong with that. it is what it is.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-06-25T04:11:52.899+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Getting people hyped pretty much benefits everyone involved so I'm all for it. Feedback is hugely important at this stage, and the long queues are feedback in itself. This is something players want, and want bad. They still need specific feedback though, and streamers are much more equipped and inclined to provide that than the average player is.\n\nI'm not a Rioter either, only a volunteer.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DantePup64","date":"2019-06-21T08:36:14.258+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know but multiple days and multiple nights I have left the PBE client open and it's either cancelled my log in attempt or done nothing in 10+ hours.\n\nOther regions are reporting issues but it doesn't seem to be as universal that no one can access as it is in OCE","replies":[]},{"poster":"Outis","date":"2019-06-20T05:13:04.869+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you really need to ask that? pretty obvious why. because it's free advertisement for their new 'game'.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omnizoom","date":"2019-06-22T15:57:47.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thew 28 hour wait is unreal , and i was planning to write out some of the builds and strats ive seen and used and how effective they are such as glacial and gunslinger","replies":[]},{"poster":"JokerSenpai12","date":"2019-06-20T07:24:09.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I put myself in the login Q 4 hours ago still haven't gotten in","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-06-20T06:38:37.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So to be clear, you shouldn't be getting moved back in queue, however Riot did state that there is a *visual* issue with the \"time estimate\" and \"position in queue\" stats, which may make it *seem* like that's happening.
