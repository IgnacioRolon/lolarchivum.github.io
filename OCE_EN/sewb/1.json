Every time I log into LoL riot asks me to verify my account. That&#039;s fine, I click send email code. However I don&#039;t receive a verification code to my email. Check inbox, check junk, search my entire email account for any emails sent to me by Riot or League of Legends.  Nothing. Okay, maybe I have set the wrong email (though I know this isn&#039;t the case cause I have a lot of other stuff from Riot in my inbox and really only have one email account) so I try and reset my email. THIS EMAIL CANNOT BE THE SAME AS PREVIOUS EMAIL. Great. \r\n\r\nI can&#039;t get past this verification screen ergo, I cannot play.\r\n\r\nEvery now and again after logging in and out of my account the message disappears. But slowly but surely it is taking more and more times of doing so to actually get into a game.\r\n\r\nPlease help.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2018-07-04T07:45:36.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey sewb!\n\nIf you [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to Riot Games Player Support, they should be able to manually send that verification email to ensure that your account is secured and ready to go!","replies":[]}]}
