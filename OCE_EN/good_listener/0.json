I&#039;ve been playing computer games religiously as far back as I can remember. I spent a majority of my time playing Wc3 and WoW before I moved on to League of Legends and I haven&#039;t stopped playing the game since. I was originally an ADC main where I climbed to about 2150 elo during season 2 on NA server, I then switched to the jungle role because of our mid laner Chief Swiffer who is basically a brother to me now. I was terrible at jungling for a while but I put in a hell of a lot of time learning the role and eventually got decent.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been on multiple teams including Team LoLa, Team Tesla, Mindfreak, Exile 5, Team Immunity and now The Chiefs. Under these teams I&#039;ve competed in multiple online and lan events, my best memories and experiences were my two international trips to WCG China and Wild Cards in Turkey.\r\n\r\nLeague of Legends has been a huge part of my life for the past few years, it has brought me lots of amazing things but a lot of anxiety and stress as well. I&#039;ve invested A LOT of time into the game which has affected my life and relationships. Thankfully I have a super supportive family and the friends I&#039;ve made in the League of Legends scene (especially my team) I basically consider my family.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions and I will try my best to answer them all!\r\n\r\nYou can follow myself and my team on Twitter and Facebook -\r\n[My Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/spookzLoL?fref=ts)\r\n[Team Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/chiefsesc?fref=ts)\r\n[@Chief_Spookz](https://twitter.com/Chief_Spookz)\r\n[@ChiefsESC](https://twitter.com/ChiefsESC)","replies":[{"poster":"Shadowarror","date":"2015-07-25T09:22:27.112+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Spookz!\n\nFirst and foremost, best wishes in both the OPL finals and also for future international events.
