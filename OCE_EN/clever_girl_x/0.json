I play &quot;Every&quot; Role there is and I do so fluently, but i feel if I mained a particular role I could excel in this game a lot. I play nearly every champion in the game, and mechanically I am well enough to outplay most gold players, but back to the main point, what role do YOU guys think I should play and why? PS: I love so many different champions so its hard for me to choose. PSS: Don&#039;t give me the &#039;people cant tell you what to play&#039;, iv had stuff like this said to me before.","replies":[{"poster":"BUY MY MIXTAPE","date":"2015-05-18T00:58:42.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play adc if you like dealing with tanks that do more damage than you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2015-05-15T12:17:14.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"play rammus jungle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nonly rammus jungle","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-05-15T12:15:53.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"who the fuck cares what you want, play to win the game. play whats best at the time that compliments your team the best. play whats strong in the meta. fuck maining anything, especially fucking solo lanes cos only dickheads main them srs. my advice is to watch non-oce lcs, watch their plays, watch what they do, observe and learn everything, then go out and play what you feel is gonna help you win, because thats what you want ultimately right?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valkrai","date":"2015-05-15T10:15:25.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"play top if u want to farm early and destroy l8. mid if u like to roam. jg if u like to roam but dont like laning. adc if u like u want the choice of being able to split and group. supp if u want to win but through feeding ur team instead. im mid lane add me if you want a decent zed on ur team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-05-15T09:44:01.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a mid lane main and I love every second of it.\n\nI feel as though it is the most diverse lane in the game. Home to Assassins, Teamfighting mages, Control Mages, Kite Mages, Roamers/Gankers, Support Mages and Tanky Damage Dealers. Ranged champions and Melee champions. Sustained damage AND Burst damage. You have the pick of the litter and there are so many good and FUN champions in this lane. \n\nAs you said, you can generally outplay most of the players in your elo and what better champions to do that with than Zed, Leblanc, Ahri, Fizz etc. I also feel as though it's the best lane to carry games with, since most of the time you will be PLAYING a champion that YOU can hard carry the game on. And if you aren't or there are champions in your side lanes that are better at carrying the game, you're right in the heart of the map and roaming is something that you can do very well and something you CAN do easily.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-05-15T06:34:00.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well if its all the same to you, main support, this will cause less rage in champ select (because for some reason people hate going supp) and also it means you can carry your adc in every game (which lets be honest is the key to victory) instead of someone else not getting mid and playing 'Zed Supp, its a thing' instead and destroying late game for your team by having a malnourished adc. \n\nOther Benefits:\nmore teams are looking for supps than mids or tops cos of the demand and supply,\n\nyou are more likely to find a game in teambuilder than other roles, same reason \n\nyou get ignored in team fights, so good players have more time to help the team throughout the fight as opposed to a 3 sec \"I'm in... I'm out...\" fizz or talon etc. \n\nyou have the opportunity to pick a tank without sacrificing dmg. so often people in top or jung wont pick tanks because they dont like not getting as many kills, whereas with supp getting kills isn't a problem and so if you have a selfish top and jung, you can pick a tank without causing problems for the team. \n\nyou have unexpected potential, for example my main supp is taric, and by mid game you can 1v1 their adc and win, and by late game you can 1v1 their adc and come out with more hp than when you went in. \n\n\nAnyaway that my 2 cents, and even if after this you are going \"yea but i dont wanna play supp every game\" then at least thats cancelled out one choice for you.\ni hope i helped :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-05-15T01:29:21.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you can play everything at a similar level, your teammates will generally do better (since you can let them play the roles they're good at more often) and you don't have to carry as hard.\n\nIf you main one role, your teammates are more likely to get stuck on their bad roles and feed (so you need to carry harder when you get your role), and you're gunna do worse if you cant get your role (so you need to have a much higher winrate on your main to make up for this).\n\nIn my experience (climbed from silver to plat this season just filling) the easiest ones to carry with are jungle/mid/support since they have the biggest effect on the map. Support and jungle are probably the best if you're looking to main one since they dont get called very often and you can probably get them in 80%+ of your games. A good jungler can win every lane and a half decent support can easily crush bot lane by themselves(there's not many support mains in gold so you're opponents will often suck) and start roaming early to get vision and gank other lanes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-05-14T15:10:52.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"main whatever role you find funnest\n/thread","replies":[]}]}
