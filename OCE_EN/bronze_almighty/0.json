When returned with success, it will be tested continually, \"While making small adjustment one step at a time\" untill it is refined. In other words, the one that won the most is the keepsake moving forward.  \n\nGathering knowledges is not a one person job. It's many people doing different things contributing in polishing the outcome. The players now and before; Tested their strategies in solo Qs or scrims. If the plan have a high % of success rate, then it will be applied and make into meta games. This can only be done through learning from others, what would work and what wouldnt.\n\nThe knowledge is then amass through periods of times and constantly evolving.\n\n--------\n_\"Can somebody become as good as they are without looking at the guides?\" _\n\nYes, get a coach. Or learns by playing with others. Guides is a written form of teaching. Other forms of education also exist. Such as observation. You can go into games and review good players, Or stream; By watching the methods of how it was done. \n\nBut why bother doing the ground work? That is comparible to going to math class, and instead of taking the given formula to solve a question; You want to discover the formula 1st?. THEN, slog your way TOWARD the question??. Unless you're a genuise, forget it. Big waste of time.\n\nSo inorder to be an innovator or in your word \"good\"? You need to learn fast, good at playing the game, wins a lot, and play lots of games so your method can go through it stages of refinement.","replies":[]}]}
