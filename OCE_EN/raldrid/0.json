The first thing that went to my mind is so many people in LoL dont buy a trinket or do buy a trinket but never use it. Not buying a trinket defeats the purpose of having a trinket slot or if you dont use it why have a trinket slot. So i was looking back at what riot did in season 3 not having trinkets but having an explorerward in the masteries and then causing supports to be warding for the team. I thought we could come back to this way but change it a bit allowing supports to not ward as much and wanting the Top, Mid, Jungle and Marksman roles to be a part of the warding team. This is when i thought of having a passive in the trinket position instead of an Active. I thought if everyone in LoL could buy something for free which would passively contribute to winning lane helping late game and changing LoL for the positive why not tell this to everyone. Elements would have different passives and of course have an upgrade like the trinkets this season have. For example one idea for a element would be Earth, The earth element would be for the supports who love initiating for example leona, thresh, and alistair. These supports would get a movespeed buff depending on how many allies were behind them and how many enemies were infront of them. When combat would arise the champion would get a 'UNITE' buff causing him to take less damage by increasing his armour and magicresist for a certain amount of time ( a reasonable time would be 1 seccond).\n\nBut if you look at that it doesnt help the role of support. That is where the upgrade comes into place. The upgrade would help specific roles adapt to the later in the game. The upgrade for the supports on every item would be  'SIGHT'. Sight would give the support a bonus for warding and the warding item. The sight buff would reduce the cost of wards by 25 gold on the classic sight ward and reduce the cost of 30 gold on the vision ward. This would help the support place more wards for a cheaper price bringing back the support sees all role instead of the team sees all. Through this change supports would still be the meg for warding like they always were but it will lighten the load for them.\n\nNow we need to explain the other Elements. These elements aren't designed for every role but work better with some roles. Water, Fire, Air, Spirit and Earth. The water element would be designed for any role who has high damage. The water element would best suit the ADC role through it reducing your basic attack damage to 0.8 of what it would normally be but having a bonus on champions that whenever the attack hits it will do a shatter of the attack and 3 small water drops will fly directly to the nearest champion. The Fire element is a casters item designed for the ranged midlaners. The Fire element increases all spell casts damage to 1.2 and if they shield an ally for example as oriana the shield strenth would be 1.2. This is an element that can also be used by an adc for example lucian. Every one of lucians bullets from his Ultimate would each be increased in damage by the fire element. Air is a Crowd Control element designed for the champions who want to protect an ally for help the team. The Air element will create disruption in fights. The air element increases your movespeed by 20% of your total movespeed (does not stack with itself). The air element also gives a slight knockback every 2 secconds, so if the enemy champion is extremly close your knockback would be larger than if they were further away. The spirit element increases your HP, Mana and your Cooldown Reduction (this cooldown reduction can be added onto your normal cooldown reduction even if it is max, 40%). Finally the Earth element has no passives buffs but has a laning and late game buff for you. \n\nNow we have to explain the 'UPGRADE' on these elements. Each upgrade is specificly designed for every role. Power, Defence, Speed, Assault, Sight and Allegiance are the upgrades for each of the roles. The Power upgrade is designed for the MID role increasing there ap to by 20%. The Defence upgrade is designed for the TOP role increasing their Health by 5% and increasing their health regen by 10%. The Speed upgrade is designed for the Junglers and the initiators increasing their movespeed by 100. The Assault upgrade is designed for the ADC and Fighter TOP's increasing their base AD by 20% ( if the champion has the water element and assault upgrade their basic attack damage is returned to normal). Finally the Allegiance upgrade is designed for Supports increasing their heals by 20% and giving 20 armour to whomever they heal for 2 secconds (soraka can stack this). The bonus for sight has already been explained previously in this board. \n\nFinally i believe the change to trinkets explained in this board can be negative at first but when players adapt to the changes this could be something that seperates LoL from the other MOBA's in this category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(my spelling was bad in this because i just woke up and wrote it)","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2014-12-12T23:59:09.228+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"= no one wants blue trinket","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2014-12-13T06:42:08.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tl;dr\n\nExplain it in a few words.","replies":[]},{"poster":"idc","date":"2014-12-13T06:16:15.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't understand how this is reinventing the trinket?

You say that a lot of people don't use their trinkets, I use mine all the time, riot have done a good job on trinkets and I don't think they should change it again just to suit players who can't ward, that's why riot created bronze.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riso","date":"2014-12-13T06:02:18.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tl:dr","replies":[]}]}
