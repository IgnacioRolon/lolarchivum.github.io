The site however usually fails to load the personal information and when it does it tells me I have 0 points. I am concerned because at the rate of point acquisition by the time I am able to play again all the goals will be reached. Is there a way to confirm the points I have gained? If not the whole thing is a bust for me.\n\nEdit: 25/01 According to the updated Q&A the issue is with display only, so problem solved.","replies":[]}
