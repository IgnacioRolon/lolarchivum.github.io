For your health per/5 total expand your Champion Stats window to the left of your portrait by clicking the helmet icon or pressing your hotkey.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kenja","date":"2016-02-06T10:14:30.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So to get this straight my health regen isn't going down or anything? its just showing different things","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-06T11:39:53.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes. On your actual health bar in the bottom middle of the screen it shows health regen per second. The amounts in masteries/runes and shown in your expanded character stats are always regen per 5 (it's the same with mana). The ONLY place you will see regen per second is on your actual health bar down the bottom. \n\nSo if you had 8.9 health regen in runes, its per 5, so you have 1.8~ regen per second which is what would show on your health bar. Add in masteries etc and you'd get the numbers you've been seeing.\n\nHope I explained it clearly enough :)","replies":[]}]}]}
