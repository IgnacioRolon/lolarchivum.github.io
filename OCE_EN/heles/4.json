Not too serious, but needs to be consistent, playing once a day at like 5pm (or 9pm if more suitable) on weekdays and more flexible times on weekends (mornings or evenings). Only looking for people that are willing to stick to one role they are good at, and am only looking for a total of 5 stable members with rarely any subbing. pref age group around 15-16 but doesn&#039;t matter. Add and we&#039;ll discuss comps and hopefully get a game started by the evening or tomorrow.","replies":[{"poster":"YouDiedInVayne","date":"2015-09-01T06:31:04.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there, Gold 1 adc main but can play pretty much all roles (don't enjoy supp that much xD)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Etrite","date":"2015-08-30T03:13:16.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently ranked plat 4.
