I am currently silver 3, mainly play adc. No skype / Curse voice. Can use curse / skype on Thursday, when I can probs play the most. Main qualities looking for are keeping a eye on the map and focusing on peeling for me.","replies":[{"poster":"think123","date":"2015-03-08T00:47:58.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Duoed with this guy before, likes to get B.F. Sword early, generally jinx / graves / kalista main, good picks for support include leona, morgana and thresh. Prefers lane pushed out, rather bad warder (hence being silver and not gold), uses somewhat non-meta builds (such as full-ad non runaan's kalista) that generally work well nonetheless. Never gives up in game, is never toxic, very worthy of duo (I don't have time to duo, otherwise I would).","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-08T06:28:19.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">rather bad warder\n\n......................\n\nHis an ADC main?","replies":[{"poster":"think123","date":"2015-06-24T09:28:06.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, he mains ADC, also can play mid, jg and support, though as I said, not a very good warder :)","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-24T09:30:12.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
