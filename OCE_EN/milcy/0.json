I&#039;ve lost most motivation to even bother playing, especially after the last month or so of the season where it was really bad. Team Builder is also a cesspool right now, due to the new map, where it used to be my favourite game mode for low-stress, troll-free games. I did one game tonight and it was all I could tolerate.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I feel like the trolls have all the power and I believe that regular players are likely the ones getting punished for losing their temper, venting their frustration, etc... &gt;We need some serious quality of life changes for season 5&lt; to mitigate the negative impact that these people have on the game. Bring back the tribunal, implement vote-kicks in certain scenarios, address DCs/AFKs/ragequits. The problems are obvious, but nobody seems to be working on any solutions...\r\n\r\nI love this post, it speaks alot of sense.","replies":[{"poster":"Seamooo","date":"2015-04-23T12:29:58.781+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had a pretty bad experience of a troll where he played anivia which i first thought was just to steal my lane so i went adc and he proceeded to follow me into lane and try and wall me to get me killed and stop my backs.
