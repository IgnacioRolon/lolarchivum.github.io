Make sure you go to the toilet before you que up. \r\n\r\nStep2. Having a good connection is always a bonus, close down any programs that take bandwidth.\r\n\r\nStep3. If you play ranks, preferably do it when you know you don&#039;t have anything to attend to.\r\n\r\nStep4. Clear all distractions. Such as girlfriend/Pets/Noises.\r\n\r\nStep5.  Stock up on snacks and drinks so you don&#039;t have to duck out and make a feast.\r\n\r\nI hope these simple steps will improve the gameplay for every LoLer.","replies":[{"poster":"Itstomuhohh","date":"2015-04-20T14:57:31.303+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cover walls with pillows so you have something softer to punch into after you rage at the 0-15 idiot jungler","replies":[{"poster":"Milcy","date":"2015-04-20T18:17:34.787+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"God damn you just described my game. > Lee-1-19-3 < Everyone in the match just Flamed the absolute crap out of him.{{item:3751}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-20T13:23:31.173+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Step4.
