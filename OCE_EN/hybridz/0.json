Have you tried playing a normal/ranked/ARAM game while URF was in the rotating queue? I'd assume not, considering you seem to think there's no downside to a perma-URF queue. Other queues end up with 5-10+ minute queue times *at lower levels* of play while higher levels of play experience drastically sky-rocketed queues.\n\nThen we come to the enjoyment of it (as has been pointed out already). URF is fun enough when it's a temporary queue. The first day or so is, by far, the most enjoyable as people are *generally* trying more varied champs/tactics but, as you would expect, it starts to become a queue of try-hards using what they consider to be the most overpowered champion(s) of the mode. With most-everyone doing that, it becomes the worst mode in the game.\n\n> Urf should have its place in LoL and not just a \"novalty mode\"\n\nExcept URF *IS* a novelty mode. It was never intended as anything more, and was never intended to have a permanent place within the game. We're lucky that Riot actually listened to the community and implemented the rotating queue so that it *would* have a (semi-)permanent place within the game.\n\nThe rotating queue is enough to provide the fun of the featured game modes without taking away from what LoL is *really* about.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vegathron","date":"2016-05-23T02:22:15.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the 1st day of urf is always fun but by sunday evening its absolutely trash as the entire teamcomp is literally ALL broken unfun champs that are just WAY over powered. people figure out or remember whats broken op and it kills it for me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-05-22T23:24:14.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ehh URF bores me...","replies":[]},{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2016-05-22T22:28:18.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why give urf special treatment? its not like its the best gamemode, OFA has that title.","replies":[]}]}
