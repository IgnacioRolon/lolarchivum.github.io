I expect at least 3 crates, that saying if 1 is the best you can do its better than nothing.\r\n2) Randomly generated Skin\r\n3) Randomly generated Champion card in loot.\r\n4) Any other beneficial reward that helps us play the game to make up for lost time.\r\n5) Bonus RP per player, this is time we could of actually spent ourselves earning, gaining, or spending.\r\n\r\nEither way you look at it something has to give in light of the situation, your a well funded business.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading.{{champion:268}}","replies":[{"poster":"Kreator","date":"2016-05-05T13:02:46.355+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are approximately 183,000 people that play ranked on OCE\nwe can add around another 100,000-150,000 people for normal ques like twisted treeline and ARAM\nlets take your first example, you want three crates and they need to be worth something right? so lets put a costing value of $41AUD on it.\n\nMath time\n280,000 x $41= $11,480,000 **For one crate**\nthat figure there is not exactly accurate but you get the idea that its completely _dumb_ for a 3 hour downtime\nThats also ignoring all of the personal details they'd need to gather to facilitate all of the shipping to get the loot out to everyone. \n\nServers have issues, they're losing money every second the servers are down because micro-transactions aren't running, they're not going to give out any reparations for this small issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hybridz","date":"2016-05-17T19:16:20.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"like they are that rich that they aren't willing to give back to the people who made them rich, the community...........Okai yeah I'm not expecting fucking a million dollers each but hey, just a small bonus or even double RP or something for the downtime..........\n\n\nits not to fucking much to ask than if they are making 11million dollers ............................................................","replies":[]}]}
