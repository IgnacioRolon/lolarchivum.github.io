First\r\n\r\nDetermine the best time to lay your first gank..............\r\nFor many champs like lee sin its around early game......... Don&#039;t wait for level 6........\r\n\r\nWhy should I gank at lvl 2 or 4 or 3 or why should I gank in the early game?\r\n\r\nWe have a term called snowball, lane pressure, and lane security...........\r\nLet me define these terms for you.\r\n\r\nSnowball lane........= When you gank a lane and cause a rippling effect across the lane, forcing the other team to lose income, die, or in some way fall below the laner.\r\n\r\n\r\nLane pressure = Just means to have a presence in a lane to help out laners\r\n\r\nLane security = Being in the right place at the right time when the other Jungler is in that lane about to gank\r\n\r\nSometimes these things may need you to use wards, buying a warding item or just being more Map aware and using the best gank routes possible............................... Fishing out enemy wards will help you to stay unseen.\r\nSneaky ganks are good ganks......................\r\n\r\nGanking at an early stage is important but remember the role you play to your team, early game early damage, late game later tank or support role, a jungler will never play a hyper carry role unless super fed, if you become super fed as a jungler, you have the option to become more of a carry but if the game goes into late stages remember your role Like lee sin I would start tanking up, warwick, jarvan, etc because it will take a 5v5 effort to finish the game..\r\n\r\nRunes and masteries are very important, make sure you are using the correct runes and masteries to suit the champion, I love changing it up but at the same time, no point having an extra defensive rune if your looking to pressure early","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-12T00:02:49.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bronze 5, complains junglers don't know what to do.\n\nYeah you probably don't either.","replies":[{"poster":"hybridz","date":"2016-01-19T14:54:38.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=27qNEnWg,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-07-12T00:02:49.572+0000)\n>\n> Bronze 5, complains junglers don't know what to do.\n> \n> Yeah you probably don't either.\n\nI have had Gold and platinum accounts, however I have this account in Bronze 5 to play with some real life friends, if thats an issue with you than maybe you should be asking for tips :)","replies":[{"poster":"hybridz","date":"2016-01-19T15:00:11.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=hybridz,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=27qNEnWg,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-01-19T14:54:38.404+0000)\n>\n> I have had Gold and platinum accounts, however I have this account in Bronze 5 to play with some real life friends, if thats an issue with you than maybe you should be asking for tips :)\n\nAlso did you even read over what I have put up, If I didn't know what I Was doing and blaming it on others I wouldnt be trying to help them, if my 5s team from my main account vs'd yours we would woop your bum, our 5s team competes at S.A lan events weekly In a high league.
