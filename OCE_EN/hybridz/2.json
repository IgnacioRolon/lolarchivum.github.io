Please keep in mind that player support is busy and it may take a lil while for them to get back to you (almost always reply within a week). During this time do not lodge multiple tickets or continue adding information to your existing ticket, as it may send your enquiry to the back of the queue. \n\nDue to privacy reasons Riot can't respond to your ticket with details about if a punishment was handed out or not.","replies":[{"poster":"CookieButtLav","date":"2016-04-18T18:28:13.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is

multiple accounts allows me to play with friends at different elo's regardless of my Win Loss ratio, I prefer not to get stuck in normal ques either because yeah just because I have a gold rank doesn't mean I can always compete with Diamond players.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-04-21T18:47:49.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok, its just that you said you \"went
