So I logged onto my Battleping account, routed to the Sydney server --> logged onto LoL, and voila! 50 ping again!\n\nHopefully it works for you! If you don't want to use battleping, which costs money, you can try WTFast :). It's free ^^.\n\nGLHF <3","replies":[{"poster":"CyanShinobi","date":"2015-04-23T09:00:18.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm in East Aus, and have been having ping and Attempted to Reconnects (A2R) issues for over a month.

So far that has seemed to fix my problem. I don't feel comfortable sharing private contact details, so I'll let you know via this board about whether WTFast or the maintenance has fixed the problem. :) thankyou~\n\nAlso, I don't know if anyone else has had this problem but, quite a few times this year when I've logged onto LoL, or just started a game, the LoL client will completely kick me off the internet. My computer would then be unable to find any wireless networks. I would have to restart my computer to fix it. It only happened with LoL.

WTFast wen't well for 1 game as someone said it would then it just gave me connection errors etc etc.. can anybody help?\n\nHave you tried turning inter leaving off? its done through your ISP.\n\nquote from my ISP \"If having low latency (or ping) is important to you might want to turn interleaving off - especially for online gaming.\"\n\nBut there are downsides to having it off. Here is a speal about it:\n\nInterleaving is basically a way to arrange data to protect against burst errors, which happen rarely but can disrupt data transmission when they do occur. The downside to having interleaving enabled is that it increases latency (i.e. it slows down the connection).\n\nThink of interleaving using a sieve for flour. The smaller the gaps in the sieve (interleaving on) then the better lower chance that there are bugs (errors) getting through. The bigger the gaps (interleaving off) then the higher the chance of bugs getting into the mix. This will also affect the speed of the connection - the smaller gaps mean the flour takes longer to flow through.\n\nI'm gunna get mine turned off because idc about dl speed as PING is way more important to me. Hope this helps.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Stormed by Janna","date":"2015-04-23T22:40:23.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone posted on another thread that their ping is back to normal\n\nIs this true for everyone else?

Try Hotspot Shield (http://www.hotspotshield.com/) it's free and easy to use; all you have to do is change the 'Virtual Location' to 'Australia'.\n\nGood Luck!,\n\n~ORION~","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stormed by Janna","date":"2015-04-23T09:34:43.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad it worked for ya Dread,\n\nThe reason it works I think (and I am by no means an expert, and merely speculating) is partly because the high latency seems to be a routing issue to the OCE LoL server, rather than a connection issue from the user.
