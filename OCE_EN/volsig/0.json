During a fight, I used Ring of Frost (W) while Rek'Sai was tunnelling away. She was on my left and tunnelled past me through to my right. She already started the animation for his ability as i W'd, and it hit her because i saw the ice animation around her. But she continued to burrow away, and when she came out the other side (with the ice animation still on her) she jumped out of the tunnel and continued away.  This happened twice in this game. Even with my slow from Ice Shard didn't seem to affect Rek'Sai's ability to (in this case) exit the fight through opening a tunnel and going through it. \r\n\r\nI don't know. Is there something wrong there? I mean, at no point was Rek'Sai rooted even coming out of the tunnel, and the description of Ring of Frost is to root enemies for a short time. Going through a tunnel, Rek'Sai wasn't slowed (to my eyes anyway, i could be wrong). So whats the point of using Liss for some CC when it doesn't work on Rek'Sai. I would have thought that Rek'Sai's tunnel would have just been shortened and had to pop out because she is supposed to be rooted. Or she is just rooted where she is, mid tunnel burrow. The description of Tunnel doesn't state anything about CC, so this is why i am questioning what is happening here. If i was to Entomb onto a Rek'Sai JUST as her animation for Tunnel started, using this logic, Rek'Sai would continue to Tunnel away and jump out at the end and move on. I haven't been able to try this as i play LoL alone and have no friends lol. \r\n\r\nIm also not going to say if I won or lost, because it isn't important. Im not salty, nor am I being picky for more kills. I just saw something that I personally didn't think was right. Any feedback is appreciated - even if its to teach this nub something about the game haha. \r\nThanks all\r\nVolSig","replies":[{"poster":"n2unswe82","date":"2015-01-17T01:12:45.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://puu.sh/eCsJZ/e2f023df40.jpg get rekt on you scrub gg loss\nalso i don't know but it never said in the tooltip that she could be stopped by cc","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-17T01:39:21.332+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=n2unswe82,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=KgQ0Uubn,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-17T01:12:45.207+0000)\n>\n> http://puu.sh/eCsJZ/e2f023df40.jpg get rekt on you scrub gg loss\n> also i don't know but it never said in the tooltip that she could be stopped by cc\n\nOP mentioned the fact that their win or loss didn't matter.

It doesn't mention CC at all. If she is untargetable, it should say. If she is targetable, shouldnt she then be rooted/snared/stunned etc?  Can you kill Rek'Sai while mid tunnel? if so, why cant you CC?\n\nWhy did you waste the time to do that hahaha. I am impressed that you thought it was that important. But clearly it wasn't. Little embarrassing to be honest lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Swiftspice","date":"2015-01-17T02:10:19.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can kill zed mid ult","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-01-17T04:20:30.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rek'sai tunnels are a little buggy. I mean, Blitz can grab him out of the tunnel, but morg snare can't stop the movement. Thresh can also flay a reksai out of a tunnel. just weird interactions.","replies":[{"poster":"VolSig","date":"2015-01-17T06:33:40.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm. I don't like it. Its a waste of an ability, just because she it Tunnelling it won't work? You cant grab/flay a champ in any other instance and not have CC. SO it seems inconsistent that this is the case. And if it is the case where tunnels are CC free, it should be clarified. Then again, it could be a bug. Clarification would be nice is all.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-01-17T05:52:09.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The cc comes at the end unless its a pull/knock back","replies":[{"poster":"VolSig","date":"2015-01-17T06:31:54.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But no where else in the game is there an ability where a flay/grab/pull a champion works but not CC them? Well, i cant think of one now anyway. No where in champ spotlights does Riot mention the effect of CC on Rek'Sai during abilities, so it kind of seems inconsistent with the rest of the game. Yes Rek'Sai is a very unique champion, but it just doesn't line up for me. At least, id like that point cleared up. But I do see what you mean.","replies":[]}]}]}
