I&#039;m in my first 10 games of ranked and for some reason they put me with a bunch of people who don&#039;t know how to play. They only have 100 wins, how are they expected to know how to play? They are all unranked yet the other team has a gold and two silvers...\n\nEvery single lane fed except for mine. Even if Riot expected me to help the team out because I&#039;m more experienced, there is no way I could help all three lanes at once, and then stop my jungle from feeding somehow.\n\nI just don&#039;t really understand what the point here was, it seems too specific for this to just be bad luck, I got stuck with a bunch of newbies.\n\nAnd just to make things worse, our reksai went AFK anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Diamond Carry","date":"2015-04-20T20:35:41.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unranked is basically silver, and the guy in gold has trash MMR.
