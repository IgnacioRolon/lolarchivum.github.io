The main time I have spare is between years which coincides mostly with preseason.\n\nSo what I am more or less asking is that, hypothetically I can climb, for the sake of the stats lets say to platinum. \n\nHow will this &#039;preseason&#039; rank weigh and then compare to how the initial placement / 10 placements will effect. \n(Basically will the soft mmr reset disregard preseason climb) if this makes sense.\n\nCheers.\n\n{{champion:27}}","replies":[{"poster":"JinHae","date":"2018-11-07T09:33:12.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No your mmr will not 'reset'. If you climb to plat during the preseason and get placed in gold at the start you will find it easier to climb back because your MMR is higher than where you're supposed to be, so if you're actually meant to be in plat you will easily climb back if you're winning at least 50% of your games. For challenger/master/diamond players its harder because they can get shoved down to plat/low diamond and they're essentially getting matched with a mixed bag of players, during this time if you can face higher ranked players the start of the season is the best time for someone who reached plat to rank up since the mmr gains from vsing people with master/diamond mmr is great. \n\nTL;DR: Play enough games when the new season starts and it will reflect your preseason grind.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-11-07T09:17:23.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No one knows for sure and Riot never answers. The consensus is that it matters, but not as much as if you climbed during the regular season.\n\nSo its not a \"waste of time\" but if you only climb to say Gold 4 or 3, it probably wont do much; but if you can reach Plat, you will notice the difference.\n\nPlus next season with the tiers only having 4 ranks, who knows how it will effect peoples placements since there is going to be a little MMR reshuffle to fit in the 2 new ranks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LRIG Tama","date":"2018-11-07T08:05:31.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, preseason climb is not disregarded. Like if you end the season Bronze V and climb to Challenger in preseason (an extreme example, but still...), you'd start next season at Plat I with high Master/Grandmaster MMR. You wouldn't start low Bronze or Iron.\n\nSo if you climbed to Plat V during preseason, then you'd probably reset to a mid-Gold MMR. I'm saying probably since no one but Riot actually knows what happens, and it also depends on whether or not you go 10/0 or 0/10 in placements.","replies":[]}]}
