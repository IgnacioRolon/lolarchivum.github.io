Basically you join as a single player and get drafted by the team captains, there'll be no prizing so if you're in it for the RP, it's probably not what you're looking for. If you're like us and are interested in fun however, feel free to shoot me a PM on Discord. As of now we're looking for Reserve players however it's quite likely that a few of the people who haven't locked in their commitment will not be available so get to signing up now - **even if you can't make this one, we'll likely run very similar events in the future.** The tournament will be on Sunday the 1st of December at 12:00 PM AEDT and the Draft will (likely) be the day before at 5 PM AEDT. If you're still reading, feel free to message me on Discord at **Zed eS#1194**.\r\nSee you on the rift summoners!","replies":[{"poster":"TFT N1","date":"2019-11-21T00:26:35.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'm in","replies":[]}]}
