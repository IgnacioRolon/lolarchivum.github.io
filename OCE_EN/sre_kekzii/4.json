It will be a 32 player Battle Royale style tournament. The schedule and format are explained in more detail below. If you're interested in signing up, please see the links down the bottom of the post! There are only 32 spots left so get in quick.\r\n\r\n_**Format**_\r\nEssentially, the format we'll be running with will be a Group Stage format, essentially, 32 players will be seeded into 4 groups of 8 players, for simplicity, we'll call them Groups A to D. All the groups will play 1 game and the bottom 4 of each group are eliminated, after the game, Group A and Group B will combine into another group of 8, meaning C and D will also follow-suit for another game. After that game is played, we'll have reached the final stage after we eliminate, yet again, the bottom 4 players in each group. The winner of the final stage will then be declared the No Sleep Palace TFT Cup Champion.\r\n\r\n_**Schedule**_\r\nThe tournament is scheduled for Saturday the 24th of August at 3:00 PM AEST, below is a estimated schedule for the event.\r\nRound of 32 - 3:00 PM AEST\r\nRound of 16 - 3:40 PM AEST\r\nFinal Stage - 4:20 PM AEST\r\nConclusion of Event - 5:00 PM AEST\r\n\r\n_**Signing Up**_\r\nAll players must be in the Discord to receive updates regarding the tournament, the discord link can be found [here](https://discord.gg/2d52A7x).
