Please contact your provider for more information.\r\n\r\nI called up yesterday and today and on their end, they can&#039;t see any reason to why it would be doing this so I was just wondering if anyone else was having issues with card payments on League at the moment? \r\n\r\n- Alessi {{champion:497}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-17T14:51:20.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a strange one.

There are two current workarounds:\n\n1. Open the support page in an incognito/private window and follow the process as normal, pressing the login button when prompted.\n\n2. Log out of the website **from the support page**, and then follow the process as normal, pressing login when prompted.\n\nIf your support page has the blank \"OC\" login in the top right, you're good to go. If it only has your summoner icon with \"OCEANIA\" it means the support page is seeing you as logged in on the website and not in support. You need to follow one of the steps above.","replies":[]}]}
