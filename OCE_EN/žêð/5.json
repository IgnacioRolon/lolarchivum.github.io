I'm pretty sure you can't get it until worlds next year.\n\nChampionship is by far the best skin out of the three, but if I am right and it's a legacy, I would definitely go with shock blade. I personally dislike the look of shockblade Zed, but it feels good too play. And it has chromas, so that's always another reason too buy it over the others.\n\nIf I am mistaken however and championship zed is available, get that for sure. One of the best worlds skins made to date. \n\nBut whatever you do don't buy skt for gods sake. It is one of the ugliest, worst skins made imo. Yuck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BushMstr","date":"2017-04-13T13:31:32.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Championship is the smoothest skt is no different to the normal, and shockblade is okay...","replies":[]}]}
