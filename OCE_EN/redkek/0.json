It really hurts when he steals 10% of all your stats, unless you have a massive xp lead, there's no outplaying that, and unlike similar abilities like trundle, you can't just disengage or rely on peel since you'll be stuck in his little arena and he's big now.\n\nAlso I don't understand the morderkaiser ult + rylias interaction. On some champions the slow persists the entire ult duration, on others it's only like half a second.\n\nHowever when mordekaiser ult is down, he's often a useless bag of scrap, since he's easy to kite and peel, squishy, easy to bully in lane, can't teamfight and immobile.\n\nI feel they should weaken his ult a bit but lower it's cooldown. It's a cool ability with alot of utility, but for a toplaner ( I assume that's where he'll end up ) this type of ability should have a lower cooldown, and less dramatic of an impact.\n\nAlso they need to fix the Mord bugs, for instance Mord managed to accidentally ult a sylas shaco clone (but not shaco's clone itself in custom game?) and if he gets Silenced by Soraka whilst ulting, it appears to be permanent? idk.","replies":[{"poster":"RedKek","date":"2019-06-14T08:28:03.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your right,though I still prefer the old mordekaiser ultimate having a ghost follow you around was fun especially if it\"s a Jhin with 500 AD","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-06-14T10:03:05.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nah gunblade, burst an enemy yi, and then get the Yi ghost with a rylias and w, and let him go supersaiyan on the enemy team, whilst healing you for a tonne.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Évélyññ","date":"2019-06-26T20:57:56.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the only \" maybe to strong \" thing about morde currently is his passive in combination with liandry. for the rest hes completely fine.
