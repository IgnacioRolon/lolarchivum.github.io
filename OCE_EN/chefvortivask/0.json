Generic toxic chat (which is the most common) is easy to detect for the automated system, there are more nuanced cases as well but it takes less nuance in a gameplay offence to create significant doubt in automation than in chat, which means some don't get hit until they get manually reviewed (which happens often but is a slower process overall).\n\nThe result is that the automated system is a lot slower to ban in game offences, because it needs to be sure, or that the slower manual reviews pick them up first. It's designed that way to prevent people who just had a really bad game from getting banned. It sucks that it's as slow as it is, and it could definitely be better.\n\nFor now, the best thing you can do if you see an intent feeder/someone doing toxic gameplay stuff that just isn't being punished is to submit a support ticket to get it manually reviewed.\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nI will say right off the bat though, that support can't give you any details of another players account, so you will only get a generic response along the lines of \"thanks for your report\". Don't expect them to give you a confirmation of any punishment because they aren't allowed to.","replies":[]},{"poster":"staele","date":"2018-02-04T15:14:47.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What the heck is inting? some guy in an aram just accused me of it and asked for me to be reported for it... because he just abused me saying i keep being caught out (which i dont think i did) so i stood at the back of my team before they started to fight.. and...because i ran when they all died... apparently that's a reportable thing?
