Other items options include infinity edge, static shiv, ghostblade, maw, steraks, deadmans and phantom dancer. It's much more durable and you'll have a better time dueling multiple opponents rather than just bursting a single target and running away.\n\nMelt towers, objectives and champions alike and watch the entire enemy team devolve into chaos trying to work out why nobody can fight the blitzcrank. Also I'm not kidding about the melting towers thing with the double ad and reset from his e and the attack speed buff from w and his high base ad, he kills towers so quickly.","replies":[{"poster":"AlphaTrollCrank","date":"2017-01-18T02:44:42.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah yes AD top blitz. i too did this many times but i have much more fun with the pop factor. its more... trolly i guess :D suits my name better. dont get me wrong i too do enjoy the odd top AD blitz :) different play styles to spice things up! very nice, id love to see some of your plays","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-18T09:29:52.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha it's fun but aside from a few games that went well, you really wouldn't want to see my plays. I suck so bad at this game hence why I'm bronze/silver.
