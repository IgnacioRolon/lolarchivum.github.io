I still played the game, didn&#039;t int or dc but I was technically being toxic and unsportmanslike so yes I was doing the wrong thing but straight to perma-banned? Not even a 14-day suspension or game chat restriction. I have played league for 7-ish years and i have never been suspended or banned before. I have invested i think approximately $100 into this account and have some rare skins and invested probably 1500 hours into this account.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-12-07T02:41:11.966+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The system is unable to give you an instant perma for toxic behaviour, you must have received at least a 14 day ban prior to a permanent suspension for such offences.\n\nThe only circumstances that will result in an instant permanent suspension are:\n- cheating/illicit 3rd party program use\n- chargebacks\n- security bans (ban placed on the account until ownership is verified)\n\nIt's within the realm of possibility that you could receive a perma from a manual review of your accounts behaviour, but they would have to be pretty exceptional circumstances.","replies":[{"poster":"IMainTower","date":"2018-12-07T03:05:38.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My account did not fulfill the criteria of the 3 points you have mentioned.\nI am sure I have not previously been punished with a 14-day suspension and if I did, it must have been a long time ago and should be excluded in this instance.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-12-07T03:54:11.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In that case I would strongly suggest you take HeartVine's suggestion and ticket support. They'll be able to give you more context on why you were punished. \n\nIt is possible (though I was under the impression this had been fixed) that you were hit with a double punishment. This used to occur occasionally when a player would receive a punishment for one game, but get into a second before it could be applied, and then also earn a punishment for that game, effectively skipping a punishment tier.\n\nI can only speculate though, support will be able to confirm the reason for your punishment and any prior history that may or may not have contributed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-12-07T03:45:41.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As Seras said, there's only a few things that can result in an instant perma-ban. To find out which, I'd recommend checking the Reform Card (in-client pop-up) and email (sent to registered email address) which *should* provide some information regarding the punishment, possibly with some form of supporting evidence.\n\nYou might also want to get in touch with [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and see if they can provide more information about what has happened, or if you can find something that gives you a category for the ban you can appeal. In the case of cheating/3rd party program (and more general things like chat or gameplay punishments) you should use the \"Account suspensions or restrictions\" option. In the case of a chargeback ban, you'll want to use the \"Has your account been suspended for a chargeback?\" option (will be near the bottom of the list). In the case of a security ban, make sure you're logged out and use the \"Recover my account\" option (they'll ask a bunch of questions, you don't have to answer all of them, just enough to prove beyond reasonable doubt that you're the original account owner).","replies":[]}]}
