I haven&#039;t even been able to get to the login screen. My download speed is too slow when downloading a patch and my patcher is scanning up to 10,000 files. I have a Windows Vista laptop and the closest I got to downloading the patch was 70%. I&#039;ve posted this on the LoL subreddit and no one has responded. Please help me, I&#039;m sick of this problem and badly want to play LoL with my friends","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-02-17T08:48:28.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nAre you currently on a wired or wireless connection?\n\nWhen the patcher is scanning files that generally means that it was closed unexpectedly last attempt at patching or you're running a repair, it will continue to scan until all corrupted files are found. When a corrupt file is found it will scan from the beginning again. Please let this run until completion.","replies":[{"poster":"IMainTower","date":"2016-02-21T08:04:29.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello SephirothSG\n\nI am currently on a wireless connect and I have let it finish and scan about 12000 files but the real problem is the download speed which is normally below 500kbps and according to speedtest.net, my actual download speed is about 30Mbps and at the lowest of 14Mbps","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-02-21T19:53:35.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds about accurate, speedtest is a single file where as the patcher afaik is constantly making new connections and downloading hundreds of files. Plus you're on wifi.\n\nDo you have P2P transfer enabled in your patcher? (Gear in the top right, enable P2P transfer) If not, enable it. Might help.","replies":[{"poster":"IMainTower","date":"2016-02-22T05:24:49.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I have P2P enabled","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
