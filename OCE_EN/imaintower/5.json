I have never had a problem like this in my 5 years of playing LoL. I uninstalled and redownloaded LoL but it just downloads the patcher and not the actual game so that did nothing. Repair does nothing cos this is my internet speed not corrupt files","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-05T23:15:52.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Scorpeanna,\n\nThe patcher can be slow for a variety of reasons, including the speed of writing files and server load. The next time you encounter slow patching speeds, I would recommend trying a VPN like Hotspot Shield while patching your client. It might be faster, but no guarantees. Good luck!","replies":[]}]}
