Getting pretty bored of only being able to play Howling Abyss, Summoners Rift and Twisted Treeline. I think it would be pretty unique to be able to play in different lands / worlds or something. Just spit balling here but something new would be pretty cool and exciting. Please no hate just expressing my opinion and wondering if others might be thinking the same thing.","replies":[{"poster":"HaveYouSeenMyCat","date":"2017-03-10T03:43:01.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they wont because they are rito and don't cater to there fan-base and just enjoy money.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wohltat","date":"2016-04-12T15:42:20.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why?
