There is defiantly something unsettling in the tone. The hairs stick up on the back of your neck. Your heart pumps a little faster and a slow crawling sense of dread hangs low in your stomach. You feel as if you are 5 and you are desperately lost on a beach or you have just slipped and barely caught your balance on a mossy rock. An uncontrollable trickle of panic filling your being drip by drip. \r\n \r\n&quot;Hello, Oh how far you have wandered to find yourself here with me&quot;\r\n \r\n&quot;I bet that you think your reality is yours, a open lock, a solved riddle, the one thing that you can count on.&nbsp;It is YOUR reality right? Its not your friend&rsquo;s, your mother&rsquo;s, your uncle&rsquo;s or that rude sales clerk&rsquo;s.&quot; - The voice pauses letting the tone ring out in the emptiness. \r\n \r\n&quot;Let me ask you this, Does each entity have their own reality?  The paths that are forged by making thousands of individual choices and interactions are they predefined. A tangle of feelings and thoughts, luck and decisions nothing more?&quot; The question again hung, the voice pausing. \r\n \r\n&ldquo;Come a little closer and allow me to let you in on a secret only a few entities know.&rdquo;\r\n \r\n&quot;Reality is not yours, hahaha&quot; The laugh was dark and bellowing, each heaving breath echoing and reverberating in the nothingness \r\n \r\n&quot;It&rsquo;s mine...&quot;\r\n \r\n&quot;You see, what you define as &lsquo;reality&rsquo; is actually a tapestry of potential realities. The little control you do have is my gift to you. My divine gift that to many squander, wasting there life on poor choices and selfish desires. I don&#039;t let it bother me though, haha&quot; A short but ominous laugh rang out\r\n \r\n&quot;They always get the fate they deserve as all strings have an end that is often frayed or tangled.&quot;\r\n \r\n&quot;Have you ever felt the void?&quot;\r\n \r\n&quot;It called you didn&#039;t it?&quot;\r\n \r\n&quot;Tugging at you.&quot; \r\n \r\n&quot;Do you remember standing on a cliff?&quot;\r\n \r\n&quot;At the edge of oblivion and having it pull you, beaconing you to jump. They say its the &#039;Call of the void&#039; HAHAHA&quot; the laugh had more ferocity now epic booming waves.\r\n \r\n&quot;Its just me&quot; Said so matter of factly that it was as if it should have been obvious\r\n \r\n&quot;I grow board of the darkness and have played with my threads weaving the fate that brought you here. You see I wish to compete, in the game you call the League of Legends for i have unfinished business... with a certain flamboyant individual...&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"Wim Tinton","date":"2018-03-06T12:50:38.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm unsure if you're looking for constructive criticism, but I'll leave it here and you can do with it as you will :)\n\nI like the use of second person in the beginning, definitely fits with the dialogue. I grew a little tired with line after line of dialogue later, was there a reason you stopped the descriptions? I found it hard to connect with just the voice of someone I hadn't seen, and limited bodily description (although your first paragraph of description was very evocative.)\n\nA couple of spelling/grammatical mistakes:\n\n- \"breath\" should be \"breathe\" in the first line.\n- \"An uncontrollable trickle of panic filling your being drip by drip\" should be \"fills\"\n- \"beaconing\" should be \"beckoning.\"\n- at the end, \"board\" should be \"bored\"\n\nIn dialogue, if a paragraph ends, and the same person is speaking in the next line, you leave out the closing speech marks of that line. For example:\n\n\"Have you ever felt the void?\n\n\"It called you didn't it?\"\n\netc.\n\nIf you don't like the look of this, you could space it out with ellipses, or tag it with something like 'the voice paused.' and then resume the dialogue as normal.\n\nAlso check your capitalisations within your dialogue.\n\nWhen the voice laughs towards the end, the capitalised 'hahaha' pulled me out of the narrative a bit. I believe it would be more effective if you simply wrote 'he laughs ferociously, the sound booming out and echoing...' etc etc something similar.\n\nI enjoy what you have so far, these are just some suggestions to make it even better.\n\nBest,\n\n~Wim.","replies":[{"poster":"truffles","date":"2018-03-07T01:22:28.722+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you friend,\n\nGreat feedback.","replies":[]}]}]}
