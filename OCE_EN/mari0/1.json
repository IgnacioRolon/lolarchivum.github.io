I have the same ping and my fps is about 50-55 with vsync. This was never an issue I had on NA, so it may be to do with the Australian infrastructure that Riot has. However, the actual Australian network is vastly inferior anyway - it's more likely to be due to your provider, your router, whether you play on wireless etc, or a combination of all of these.\n\nAlso, if you're with Exetel, it's likely an issue with them. Never go for Exetel.\n\nWhat I do when having problems is to ping the NA servers (\"ping 216.52.241.254 -t\" into command prompt) and check for any variability there, so that I know if it's an issue with the OCE servers or if it's my internet.","replies":[]}]}
