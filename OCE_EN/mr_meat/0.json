Not only that, they have built (**insert damage item**) instead of building any other item that would be 100% better seeing as they are obviously behind and cannot carry anymore in their current state.\r\nAnother 10 minutes later, and the game has snowballed way out of any possible control that you once had on the game, each one of their players has a clear advantage that they cleverly used from (**insert champion name**) being able to get more gold in to the team and dominate the game due to them being fed.\r\nThe game ends, you type &quot;ggwp&quot; in all chat and the lobby too, and you move on to the next game and you don&#039;t see the feeder again.\r\n\r\nSo, happy ending, right? No.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n(Advice system + rewards starts here!)\r\n\r\nThat same person, that came into your game, ruined lane, made the game impossible to enjoy, flamed everyone to hell, and wasted roughly 30 minutes of your time, is doing the exact same thing in another persons game. So when people say &quot;all you have to do is move on to the next game&quot;, yeah that&#039;s great for me, I&#039;m all for that, but this doesn&#039;t address the issue at all. It&#039;s like having a weed, that instead of spraying it with weed killer, you simply rip it out of the ground, and then go bury it somewhere else: the problem isn&#039;t gone, it has just been moved out of sight.\r\n\r\nThere needs to be a way to reach out to these people **outside** of the game (maybe in lobby) so they aren&#039;t distracted by the match, and tell them JUST. PLAY. SAFE. And yes, all chat does exist, but chances are they will just take your criticism as negativity. There NEEDS to be a way to be able to tell someone &quot;Hey, you played well, but I think you might need to improve on this!&quot; Because the largest part, if not all of the problem in someone horrendously losing lane, is peoples inexperience,_** but most people wont be able to see what they have done wrong because no one is telling them otherwise**_.\r\n\r\nAnd the best part about the system, is that it could be used for any advice in general that you want to give people! Of course people could use this to be toxic but a simple &#039;Thumbs up or Thumbs down&#039; system could stop people from being toxic by preventing those who spread toxic messages to use this system at all. And those who use the system consistently for useful and friendly feedback on players performance? After &#039;x&#039; amount of thumbs-up-rated advice, the sender of the constructive criticism is rewarded with essence or a key fragment, or some other reward for being a friendly, positive, and contributing part of the LoL community.","replies":[]}
