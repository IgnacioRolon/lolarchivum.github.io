I haven&#039;t seen it in person (because I don&#039;t have a PBE account) but I&#039;ve seen videos/commentaries on them an it looks nice, not saying I like it but I haven&#039;t tried it so I wouldn&#039;t know. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I have a question/suggestion with the choosing a role part of the queue. Alright right now I have seen 6 options, top, jungle, mid, bot(adc), support and fill. \r\nSo what I am suggesting is adding a feature where you can choose &#039;fill - but not for ____ &#039;, for example, you can play all roles exceptionally well but cannot play a certain one if your life depended on it, for this example I will use jungle, you can play all roles but jungle, do you think there should be an option of &#039;fill but jungle&#039;? \r\nMoreover what if you don&#039;t main a role, or main only one but don&#039;t mind playing other roles, for example, someone mains mid  but doesn&#039;t mind playing another role if it&#039;s not top. Should there be an option to fill but exclude the role of top?\r\n\r\nTl;Dr : Should there be a &#039;Fill&#039; option where you can exclude a certain role.\r\n\r\nWell before you comment I would like to add that the splendid people at Riot Games, may or may not have come up with this idea or have come across this issue already, and I strongly applaud you tell me if they have in a civil manner.\r\n\r\nSo any thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"honk honk","date":"2015-11-04T22:45:01.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"If you're playing ranked and can't play every role, you shouldn't be playing ranked and are probably being carried.
