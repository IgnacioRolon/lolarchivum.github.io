Before I start this, I just wanna say that this is **my first time doing this**, also I would like to add that it is understandable if you don&#039;t believe me, as there are two sides to the story and **I&#039;m only giving my side**. As of this post, I am currently on a losing streak, so if you see my match history it isnt looking so good._\n\nAnyway so it starts in champion select, I am duo with my friend who is P3 while I&#039;m on P5. My friend is first pick and I am last, thinking I am probably going support I write &quot;anything but jg&quot;, because jg is my weakest role but I dont mind playing anything else. Mind you, I dont see myself as a bad player, nor do I see myself as a good one, I play fairly average if I do say so myself. Since we&#039;re on redside I am actually the final pick, and to my surprise I am given the role of jg, so I pick one of my safe junglers maokai.\n\nBlue Team (pick order) - Kalista, ali, rengar, syndra, wukong\nRed team (pick order) - Corki(my mate), gangplank, kennen, malz and maokai(me) \n\nFast forward to in game, we get first blood and I go to gank mid lane but gp dies to the syndra and I barely make it out alive, he says &quot;dont come mid lane.. just let me play the game how I want to&quot;, being respectful of my teammates during laning phase I dont go mid. We then start falling behind because of their superb jungler rengar who is everywhere and is ganking non stop (ofc he can&#039;t gank non stop, exaggeration, but never the less was producing a large amount of ganks). I am starting to get blamed by the gp and malz, who to my knowledge was not duo queue, I explain that I said prior to the game during champion select that I said &quot;anything but jg&quot;, gp mostly argues and states that i did not say anything backed up by malz, doubting myself I ask my duo partner who I was in a skype call with, he tells me I did and backs me up in chat, where gp states that I did infact state that but I didnt specifically state I don&#039;t/can&#039;t jg, the argument ends there.\n\nFast forward into the game I buy a sightstone because the malz did not, and then we start coming back a little but we ended up consecutively losing fights and then they end. However, before they ended, gp said in all chat to report me for &#039;trolling&#039; and here is what he said during end game lobby..\n\nhttp://puu.sh/kZlyx/8d885e633d.jpg\nhttp://puu.sh/kZlCV/5b835c2537.jpg\nhttp://puu.sh/kZlDA/8abe8a080f.jpg\n\n\n_TL;DR_ : I got blamed/flamed for picking a role I said I didn&#039;t/couldn&#039;t want to play.\n\n\nBut in his defense, I think I should&#039;ve explicitly stated I can&#039;t jg, but never the less he shouldn&#039;t have did what he did.\n\n**What are your thoughts?**\n\nEDIT: I take the game and esp ranked seriously, I myself am a competitive bloke so you'll never see me surrendering at 20 unless it's 110% unwinnable. \n\nEDIT 2: Blurred out the names of the people apart from my mates and mine.","replies":[{"poster":"Sephyre3","date":"2015-10-27T03:44:29.696+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Edited out the name and shame (reporting other players).","replies":[{"poster":"Ernest","date":"2015-10-27T10:35:57.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just did it, sorry about that","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jason","date":"2015-10-26T06:18:28.484+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a lot of points to consider here.\n\n- Flaming\nExcessive swearing and abuse is never acceptable, so they're an ass for doing that.\n\n- Competitive\nThis was a ranked game, which most people take seriously.

Total of 3 afk/dc and 1 intent feeder. 3/4 of them on my team. Won the first game as it was a 4v4. 2nd game was impossible to win because 1 teammate was not present the entire game and 1 person started to intentionally feed because another teammate abused him after 1 unsuccessful gank. If you were to check my personal stats you would see i did fine, if not quite well. But again you're just twisting things around. All I've ever said is that riot can fix these things because why should people have to constantly deal with d/c etc in their games just because they're bronze or silver? Then you always pipe in and start saying that i have some ego and the real reason I lose is because I'm really shit and deserve it.

Anyway it is not you to blame for losing this game. Other than that the enemy team comp looks really scary as well with multiple aoe cc from Kalista, Alistar, Wukong and Syndra so the chances of you winning teamfights is extremely low if the enemies are grouped up and that wukong get a good initiation on your team. You obviously did your best by doing what you think your team needs. For example the sightstone and also playing Maokai because your team clearly lacks a tank. Other than that you might want to censor the names of the teammates in the picture because i believe this is a form of name and shame. You did what you could and your Maokai pick in my opinion is a pretty good choice into a kalista and Syndra because kalista mobility is denied by Maokai's twisted advance and Syndra is really easy to gank because she lacks mobility. I am not a jungle main and don't really know much about jungling but a tip from me is to always look at the minimap and take a look at where rengar/enemy jungler apperead and invade the enemy jungle when they are spotted and ward their jungle. I believe warding the rengar's jungle will help a lot because it will significantly reduce the effectiveness of a rengar stealth gank. Other that that im pretty sure that rengar is terrible at farming the jungle and have pretty bad early clears and takes a lot of damage from the jungle so maybe play an early game jungler to shut him down.   Its seriously not your fault so don't feel down and move on. You get bad teammates and that is all to it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ernest","date":"2015-10-26T09:26:28.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll get to bluring out the names, but yeah thanks for the advice bro I don't usually get riled up about these things, it's just this one game.
