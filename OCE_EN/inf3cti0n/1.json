I&#039;m offering an alternative here.  I have had legitimate reasons for having to AFK in games.  Most recently it&#039;s been in a 5s team with my friends who all understand my situation.  Finally this has resulted in 20 minute queues... and now I&#039;ve been waiting for 2.5 hrs to get into a single game. \r\n\r\nHere is my proposition.  As an option against waiting for 5, 10, 20 minutes for each game... offer an alternative - pay $5 or $10 to clear your low priority status (or a certain amount of RP relative to the aforementioned prices).  You will then be cleared of AFK history and then start back at 5 minutes.  Doing this would allow for people to have their legitimate reasons but (like me) want to be able to play with their friends and no longer can.  This would also offer an additional revenue stream for Riot and meanwhile allowing people who would be willing to pay to justify their legitimate reason for having to AFK.\r\n\r\nI will not go into details, but if Riot wants to query my reason they can certainly contact me in many ways.\r\n\r\nPlease consider my proposition.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-11-20T10:57:58.452+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> pay $5 or $10 to clear your low priority status\n\nSo basically, turn it into a system just as corruptible as the legal system? How about no.\n\n> Doing this would allow for people to have their legitimate reasons but (like me) want to be able to play with their friends and no longer can.\n\nOnly if they have money to spend on the game... And it would also work for the intentional AFKers/DCers...\n\nI seriously can't believe you honestly think this idea is not outright idiotic...\n\n> Please consider my proposition.\n\nIt's ***never*** going to be considered so just drop it.","replies":[{"poster":"Inf3cti0n","date":"2015-11-20T11:03:21.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So what do you propose would be an adequate alternative for people with legitimate reasons?

Does that not mean you are playing with 5 other people who AREN'T your friends? Their game is ruined as well by you disconnecting. If you're playing in 5v5 custom then you don't get low priority queues. HeartVine is being pretty antagonistic about it but Riot has said time and time again, even if your reason is legitimate, you are still ruining the game for 9 other people, assuming your argument, still 5 other people. If it's something that is happening consistently enough to get you low priority queues then it's something you either need to fix, or simply allow for the low priority queues, because it means you're ruining a lot of games. Once a week and leaver buster wouldn't pick you up for it. Multiple times a day and you can expect it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-11-20T21:57:05.093+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's your responsibility to make sure you have at least 1 hour of free time, when you queue up for a game.
