Every time is a good time to practice and be better for next season. If you are playing just for the ranked border, then no, since there is no reward, besides improvement.","replies":[]},{"poster":"gravityhacker","date":"2016-11-20T04:31:41.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, it is worth it if you can do so. Your mmr at the end of preseason is taken into consideration when doing promotionals. You will most likely still be placed in bronze, if you are anywhere below silver 2.  (most likely bronze 1)","replies":[]}]}
