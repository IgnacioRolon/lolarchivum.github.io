However, the content was removed . I reposted it with a slightly other title and got banned.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAR33F17Vz8","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QAR33F17Vz8/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey guys,\r\n\r\nyesterday I was banned from the forums after I tried to post a missplay of myself. However, the system thought I want to blame people due to specific text segments. If this can happen in the forums, this can also happen in the actuall game. I made a video to document this false positive ban. What do you guys  think about that?","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-04-19T21:20:29.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The boards are actually moderated by real people, this is why it often takes so long for some posts to be taken down.\n\nI'll try to get some more information on why you were banned, but it's best you try to get in contact with a moderator yourself. Since this was on **NA**, I'd recommend having a talk with [TheCurator](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/player/NA/TheCurator). He's usually fairly active.","replies":[]}]}
