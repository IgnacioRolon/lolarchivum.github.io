You can mix and match abilities from different champions. For your basic abilities (Q,W,E) you can pick different champions abilities even if they do not correspond (e.g. When picking your Q you could pick Nidalee&#039;s Q, Fizz&#039;s E or any other basic ability). For you ultimate ability you can choose any ultimate but not basic abilities. Also players can ban 3 abilities each but no two players can ban or pick the same ability.\n\n**Other Ideas that need working on:**\nChampions stats (health, mana etc.) are chosen by the champion you pick - but this could be exploited by choosing people without mana.\nAP and AD scaling would be a bit messed up due to the mixed abilities - but could add some extra thought when putting two different scaling abilities together.\nTransform abilities (Nidalee R, Jayce R etc.) would be disabled.\n\nPlease tell me what you think and hopefully this idea turns into an actual gamemode.","replies":[{"poster":"Zombienoobs123","date":"2015-08-01T12:07:23.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This idea would take YEARS to make due to all the character animations needed to make spells, You can't just have a random Nidalee spear going through Heimers hair. Through I have no idea how else it'd work. Besides, people will just choose OP stuff like \"Nid Q, LB W , Fizz E and Jinx Ult\". Or even something like \"Blitz Q, Syndra W, Morgana E and Talon Ult\". It'd  be awesome but just so easily abused. Sure URF was like that but it had an  aspect, where you could ban OP champs and all have even options. Just saying I'd like it t happen but it probably won't sadly.","replies":[{"poster":"Pineapple Squish","date":"2015-08-02T00:38:33.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Keep in mind there are 30 ability bans in total meaning that a lot of the op abilities would be banned - but maybe this is too much. To fix this there could possibly a team builder sort of thing where you choose your picks and bans, so you have as much time as you want to create a good set of abilities, and then get matched with people who haven't banned your abilities and maybe haven't picked your abilities. As for the animations, I think they will \"just have a random Nidalee spear going through Heimer's hair\". Or you could periodically turn into Nidalee, throw the spear and turn back into Heimerdinger.\nThanks for your comment!","replies":[{"poster":"Lonely Flame","date":"2015-08-09T06:44:34.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, he's right. This concept will never happen.\nPart of what makes League of Legends balanced is the fact that you know EXACTLY what can happen when you encounter a champion. If you see someone like Darius, you know he's a close range champ and so you can plan around that. If the Darius suddenly locked you down with a Morg Q, knocked you up with a Cho'Gath Q and then jumped onto you with a Yasuo ult, how do you prepare for that?\nNot only that, as already pointed out the animation couldn't work. Abilities are designed alongside the animations. Without the visual que's that go with them, some abilities would be ridiculous. And your method of the character model constantly changing wouldn't work either as that's just begging for visual bugs to occur.\nAs far as your 'banning beforehand' method, I don't know about you but I don't want to spend 5 minutes setting up for a game.\nSorry mate but this is never going to work. Not as a game mode, not as an ability.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Coolbluey","date":"2015-08-02T22:02:11.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is this Dota","replies":[{"poster":"Pineapple Squish","date":"2015-08-03T09:55:55.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sssshhhh.....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CheVron","date":"2015-08-02T07:19:47.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A solution to the time consuming problem could be that you choose a champion, and the skills, passive and stats are given randomly.","replies":[{"poster":"Pineapple Squish","date":"2015-08-02T10:52:20.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, something like ARAM but on summoner's rift and with abilities.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Katsprky","date":"2015-08-01T10:18:12.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think there's enough time in champ select if you go in blind to make a good set, of course it's an interesting idea but it's major problem is that it ruins a champions identity by mixing and matching ability's of other champions.\n\nI personally wouldn't mind having this mode for a week after every split since it would be more of a relaxing game mode.","replies":[{"poster":"Pineapple Squish","date":"2015-08-02T00:41:56.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you read the comment i made on ZOMBIENOOBS123's post there is a possible way around the champion select issue.
