This allowed you to try the champion against bots before you actually buy them. I think this feature should be in League as the champions take quite a while to earn and buying a champion which doesn&#039;t suit you, is a big set back.\r\nFeatures it should include:\r\n\r\n* Instant level 18 (unless set otherwise)\r\n* Cooldown reset button (possibly health and mana too)\r\n* Freeze minions/bots button\r\n* Toggle/Reset minions, monsters and bots\r\n\r\nIf this is not implemented then I think the top two tiers (6300ip and 4800ip) of champions should be reduced in price.","replies":[]}
