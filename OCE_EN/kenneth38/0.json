That is alot of games, so needless to say, I have had fun on the way. I was wondering if anyone had any ideas for my 1000th Game win for me. As most people have tried already, Ive had fun with friends, strangers, cheese lanes and Wombo Teams.  Wondering what I could do for the big **1k** Hype. \r\nOr if anyone wanted to would happily party up with those interested to share this occasion.","replies":[{"poster":"Sephyre3","date":"2015-05-14T09:26:46.137+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add me in game - I'll play!","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-05-14T17:14:54.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it like, a custom.
