I've been playing since S1 and every season seems to have more and more of these leavers. I understand that not everyone has the best internet but they need to adapt their play times, losing LP constantly as a result of this is ridiculous. So far today I've played 6 ranked games, 3 of which had allies who afk'd and 2 of which had Disconnects.","replies":[]}
