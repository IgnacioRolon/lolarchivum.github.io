I was really confused as i didnt know what it was repairing because it was working a couple of days ago (it glitched out last night but i didn&#039;t pay much attention). I&#039;ve searched all over the internet and no one has mentioned this so i have no idea whats going on. Right now i dont think the progress bar is moving, it has been at least  half an hour and im pretty sure the bar has reached the end and then restarted again. I have no idea what to do, can someone help me.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-04-11T05:34:16.352+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nAre you still experiencing an issue?","replies":[]}]}
