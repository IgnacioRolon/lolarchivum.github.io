Guaranteed the more I play ranked the more I realised very recently that it is mostly premades due to the team rewards they are offering and it doesn't work out to well for them.\n\nIf you are stuck at Bronze 2, honestly, wait until you either get yourself to silver at least, or wait for the solo queue, it will change the way the dynamic queue operates and will change how the teams work and you may think twice about joining a team once the solo queue gets done. You may actually end up playing better in the full solo queue and just push yourself through.\n\nHere is my take on premade teams: You get 2-4 man premades in the 'solo' queue, they give no shits about anyone but themselves, fact. They will blame you or anyone else when the shit hits the fan, fact. One of the premades is ALWAYS shit, sometimes ALL the premades are shit, therefore they will literally only attack or do anything when they are together and ready themselves, therefore if they are falling behind, you lose. They will not group up and try to salvage the game and go for a win, they will just keep farming and sticking together until they feel it is time, by than, it is over.","replies":[]}]}
