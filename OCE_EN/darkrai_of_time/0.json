Considering that his bolts shoot in a straight line and don't home in like normal autoattacks, it gets very disorientating to use his ult. Having the range indicator would make it much more simple to use. Possibly improving his game play.","replies":[{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-03-10T06:10:01.695+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure a feint circle already appears (like Evelynns passive) when you auto attack something, showing how far your bolts will go. Maybe it has something to do with range indicators being off? Not sure.","replies":[{"poster":"kobo13","date":"2015-03-10T10:01:20.816+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"no the faint circle is for his e passive not his ultimate","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darkrai of time","date":"2015-03-10T07:48:00.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"never seen or heard of these","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-03-11T00:05:52.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"idk, I kind of feel like people want to hurt stealth champions too much","replies":[]}]}
