I would help you grind out if I had the time to play like I used to. I was in Silver for season 2 and 3. Once I stopped raging and blaming others I quickly climbed to Plat for season 4 and 5. It's clearly my peak level though and I'm fine with that.\nI would suggest just playing one role as much as you can which is a whole lot easier now to get. Try and focus on 2-3 chamions in that role. If you can win your lane then roam and get at least one other lane to win as well.\nDon't play extremely complex champions like Azir {{champion:268}} , Syndra {{champion:134}} , Lee Sin {{champion:64}}  etc. Obviously it's possible to play these champs when you not good at the game but they take a lot of skill to fully utilise. Play champs like Annie {{champion:1}}  mid, Leona  {{champion:89}} Support, Renekton {{champion:58}}  or Irelia {{champion:39}}  top. They can all easily win lane from early and you don't need to be Faker to make the most of them.\nI'm not saying you will be Challenger just because you pick easier to play champs but if you take some of the complexity out of learning the champion you will be able to spend more time focusing on the game it self rather than just controlling the champion.\nAnnie is probably my pick for someone that wants to climb. She is safe in lane, farms really well and has a fight winning ult. If I was inclined to climb to diamond that's who I would try my run with. I'm easily bored though and can't play a champion more than a game or two in a row.\nHope that helps, Good luck.","replies":[{"poster":"kami sora","date":"2016-01-26T12:35:57.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the advice.","replies":[{"poster":"khorney","date":"2016-01-28T07:23:11.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"main yi or tynd youll climb like nothiong","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chat","date":"2016-01-25T21:19:20.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oi rioter this games freezed during champ select and now im stuck in bronze thanks for the time wasting 2v5 op","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mauser","date":"2016-01-25T20:32:19.110+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"im happy to norms for a bit with you as a way of coaching if you want, not really high elo (p5) but might have a few pointers regardless","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frosted","date":"2016-01-25T18:41:02.474+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, I'm happy to do with you to help you hone your skills and maybe teach you a little on the way (Gold 2 last season). i'm currently placed into silver one, so can play a few games till we hit the division border :) Happy to help you","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-01-25T07:37:33.114+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"sounds like me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"littlemisscheeky","date":"2016-01-25T09:01:26.585+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not a high elo player, but these videos may help you:\n\nThe trading stance - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnE6tiHElSc\nHow to roam - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bp932bJRXA\nHow to carry - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQr0dgCYKhw\n\nWatching these helped me immensely to get out of bronze.","replies":[{"poster":"kami sora","date":"2016-01-25T09:25:49.107+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks, appreciated.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-01-27T03:03:52.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"add me, ill help you to silver\ni also give explanation / general knowledge on how to play this game, enough to get you out of bronze","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-01-25T15:21:30.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you really wanna get better i hope you find enjoyment out of watching the pros. theres a ton of other stuff too like understanding the meta and the patch changes and having something to build knowledge from that will help improve your gameplay","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2016-01-25T13:14:55.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing that immediately jumps out to me is the fact that of your 5 most played champions, you have all 3 of what i would class as the biggest trap champions for low rated players (vayne, yasuo and lee sin). These are the kind of champions (riven and zed are also like this) you see challenger players making big plays on and carrying games 1v5. The reality is that as a bronze player there is no way you are able to make the most of these kind of champions. While a complex champion like yasuo might be better than a simple champion like annie if both are played at maximum effectiveness against competent opponents, playing annie at 90% of her potential is WAY better than playing yasuo at 50% of his potential.\n\nYou dont need to make huge mechanical outplays and do all sorts of flashy stuff to carry in bronze or silver. All you need to do is identify and exploit the mistakes the enemies are making all over the place (and I assure you, they're there every game). Play simple champions so you can master them quickly and never mess up, then you can devote much more of your effort to making sure your doing the right thing on the map and taking advantage of all the opportunities the enemies are giving you.\n\np.s. The fact that your best winrates were on the most straightforward champions, renekton and kennen, should be further proof of this. Play more champs like these instead of the other stuff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BladeSensual","date":"2016-01-25T13:06:07.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive been playing for a little more time than you (1 season more), and i was bronze until just last season. last season i found the one champ {{champion:39}} that my playstyle clicks with and ive just gone from strength to strength from there. im now sitting in plat after ranked reset. i can tell you from personal experience that we all get rough patches, heck i went on a 23 losing streak at one stage and i was really bummed out about it.  i play 1 or 2 normals now when i lose ranked to take my mind off things. i still have trouble with map awareness, but i give myself a goal before every game to check the minimap every 5 seconds. im sure you'll get there eventually.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quavelix","date":"2016-01-25T10:15:00.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends on your champion pool as well.  This game is just not designed around being able to carry with every champ in the game.
