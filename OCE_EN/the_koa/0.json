Even untill the score screen these two ppl abusing the yasuo player that is likely to be 'Chinese'.\n\n> THE KOA N1co:  gg\n> [REMOVED - [REPORTING OTHER PLAYERS](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules)]:  gg chinadogs\n> [REMOVED]:  SHUT UP\n> [REMOVED]:  CHINA BAD\n> [REMOVED]:  You really talk like a pig, white pig\n> [REMOVED]:  CHINA NUKE BY America\n> [REMOVED]:  america 1_\n\nI know that most Chinese player that I come across have bad manners oftern having no clue of the language and refuse to corroperate with the team. Yet, I could onlt tell they come from a foreign backgrond because they used a foreign language, I've seen Chinese players who speak English or attemps to communicate with the team, it is very difficult to tell who comes from a different cultural backgroud as long as they behave like a normal none toxic league player who also wants to enjoy the game. In this case I hope all three players get punished including [REMOVED] for not using the mute function that would have prevented this.\n\nalso it seems like more ppl would view this if i include a 3m0te\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2019-09-26T08:31:12.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to OCE enjoy your stay, the popcorn is on your left.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-09-26T03:58:17.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just the average player and I'm not really any good either but in my opinion this is a good example of unacceptable behavior. From you're perspective (not that you should need to but....) you should always politely ask for people to tone down language or comments made to you or in general if you find them offensive. In some cases it could be a culture difference or some people are just lacking in manners. If it continues beyond that you may as well just mute and report. That language and those comments just are not necessary in public to random people.","replies":[]}]}
