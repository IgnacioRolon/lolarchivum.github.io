When my ping is low sometimes my character starts gliding or just suddenly appeared and reappear on a different place.

It also may be simply an increase in strain on the network such as a sibling watching you-tube and such. In which case you can take measures to lower this impact by increasing the priority of your PC in the router settings.","replies":[]}]}
