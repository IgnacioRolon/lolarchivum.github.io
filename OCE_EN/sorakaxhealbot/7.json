I don&#039;t get wtf is happening right now and they look completely weak. LGD doesn&#039;t look like the good team they were in the LPL Playoffs and IMP doesn&#039;t look as good compared to when he is playing in playoffs. Other than that the toplane Acorn TP plays are pretty bad and GodV doesn&#039;t feel like the GodV which looked dominant when they are playing back in china. I am just so disappointed with this team.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-10-04T15:01:53.111+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"everyone seems to be forgetting that they finished 5th in the regular season, winning just 24/44 games.....so glad they're getting put in their place, damn overhyped bs. riot putting pyl and godv in their best players of the tournament....what a fucking joke. imp playing well without mata? all 10 players of the samsung organisation went to a few different chinese teams, one, or in this case 2, of the chinese slots at next years worlds were highly likely to be filled with former samsung players, with the remaining team being filled with arguably the 2 best players of the KT rolster teams","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-10-05T03:43:57.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't understand why Samsung etc broke up and lost all their players?

Just so disappointed with this team and a little furious.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-10-04T14:52:57.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just really mad that we won't get to see imp go huge and be in the grand finals this year.
