There is nothing to be nervous about everyone starts somewhere!\n\nI remember my first pvp game I was playing against Morde as Morgana mid. I kept hitting morde but doing no damage and had no idea why -_- (his shield passive !) I wasn't nervous even though I had no idea why I couldnt kill morde. But I learnt from the game and just went from there step by step. No need to be nervous about playing the game just make sure you're positive and learn from each game!","replies":[{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-09-28T06:28:56.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maraudaur,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Jgt5xFTg,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-09-28T05:22:48.181+0000)\n>\n> Hey man,\n> \n> Its always easier said than done but just focus on learning a bit each game and just keep improving.

I really do suggest on just playing more and focus on what you learn from each game. Hopefully by focusing on learning rather than performance it will ease the nerves =)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ArataHaruki","date":"2015-09-28T10:15:58.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I kept hitting morde but doing no damage and had no idea why -_- (his shield passive !)\n\nIt ended up being a whole year before i found out the reason i was doing no damage to him was his shield, and that the tiny white bar under his health was that... It was so unclear as to what the heck that bar was that i just refused to play against morde from thinking he was bugged out to heck T_T","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-09-27T22:12:46.436+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had this problem when I first started. I only played bots so the pressure from pvp normals was pretty big. Honestly it sounds kinda stupid but what helps me the most is to mentally commentate my game like a streamer. \n\nSo I'll be like;\n\n\"That's fine, we got this late game\"\n\"Is flash down?\"\n\"Is this warded?\"\n\"Are they at drag?\"\n\"They can't siege with our wave clear\"\n\nIt got me thinking about the game and helped me concentrate. Also don't be hesitant to mute people, and /all chat is unnecessary, all you'll really get is people going \"lol ez\". You have no reason to communicate with the enemy until the game is over.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-09-28T08:04:19.761+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know EXACTLY how you feel. Just look at my profile and you will see that I didn't play normal games until I hit around level 20 because I just felt so pressured when I play against people. I would just play bots over and over and over again because the pressure would just cause my hands to shake playing against people. I have no idea why it happens, and it still happens to me to this day.\n\nThe way I overcame it was asking my friend irl to play with me in normal games. I felt less pressured to perform well because I was just chilling with my mate. I would ring him, put him on speaker, and we'd just talk about stuff with the occasional \"jungler's in brush\" or something like that. I still got nervous in clutch positions, and this is the reason why I hate playing ADC, but it really does help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-09-27T22:17:13.354+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its a game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Michaeltk","date":"2015-09-29T05:43:14.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just play with friends and relax and just have fun don't worry about winning or losing :P just play for fun and don't care about the outcome you'll be fine","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2015-09-28T15:21:16.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Watch worlds in a  few days, you'll learn a lot!","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-27T22:56:54.073+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"play ranked a few games then talk about shit like this","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-09-28T12:15:23.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"95% of the community are like that","replies":[]}]}]}
