Is it that i suck or he is just really really weak right now ?","replies":[{"poster":"Saythes","date":"2015-08-23T03:27:04.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's funny that people call him weak, cuz he was the first 3150 champ I got, and at lvl 6 I could just one shot people... He used to be stupidly OP, like Yi level OP, but due to so many nerfs since, he is just really weak now. I think the only thing that they have buffed him, after the nerfs, is his ultimate cd... Funny, they should nerf Yi like that!","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-08-22T18:13:59.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He needs a bit of a buff but he's not terribly weak. He's around Ryze strong imo. Can be strong, but requires you to know what you are doing with the champion.\n\nHe just takes a long time to scale up. 20-30 mins to get strong. By that time an enemy is already fed and it seems impossible for you to do Kassadin things like dive into their team insta-gib the ADC and ult away","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-08-22T16:26:47.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yer he is really weak atm a lot of champs are riot needs to buff a lot of champs but don't and haven't for a long time also needs to nerf some champs like rivin yas  tryind so on too much damage speed so on","replies":[]}]}
