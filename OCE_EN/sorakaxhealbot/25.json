Playing with bots in your team is so boring because all they do is feed. According to a friend of mine who plays quite a lot of ARAM, players who use Snowball and Ghost are Bots which i believe is true because me and my friend 2v5 an enemy team consisting of 1 human and 4 bots (who all use Snowball and Ghost). Please Ban all these bots because meeting one in game is extremely boring because the only thing they do best at is feeding and running into turrets to either get killed or executed.","replies":[{"poster":"El Vuur","date":"2015-10-04T12:15:28.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Linked [here](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/hojaHuRE-riot-have-you-noticed-the-number-of-bots-in-aram)","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-11T03:08:02.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Says SorakaXHealBoT, heh.\n\nAnd the fight between automated punishments systems and IP-farming bots continue. Who will win this delectable battle of pre-meditated programming? Found out, if a red ever posts on this thread!\n\nYour best course of action is to just report the players in question when the game's ended. Unless they've recently added a specific category for it, I think \"Spam\" will do (in most cases, you could probably go \"Intentionally Feeding\" if their score was terribad).","replies":[]}]}
