For example kindred ult, Zhonya, Qss,Kayle ult, Fizz E, Vladimir W, Ekko Ult, Zilean Ult Elise E ... Maybe give Zed&#039;s ultimate a passive effect so i won&#039;t have a worthless spell when enemies got their Zhonya or Qss.","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-10-16T06:56:55.212+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the past year or so Riot has been doing all they can to nerf the shit out of assassins, Zed has probably been hurt the most out of any assassin because his ult has been rendered useless. Is this good game design? Well no of course not, Riot has been going crazy with releasing champs that have free AOE Zhonya's and things alike. Probably to just increase the sales too rather than make good game balance, all Riot cares about these days is money and this cant really be denied.\n\nThe solution would never to have released such poorly designed champions in the first place but it's too late for that, buffing Zed would do nothing due to his ult having very little effect in today's games, the solution is to nerf/rework all these poorly designed kits, Ekko should never have gotten a heal, Kindred should never have been released with that ult, you get the idea, Riot overload champions with the dumbest things so the solution is to simply remove all the things that make them overloaded.","replies":[{"poster":"minaee","date":"2015-10-16T21:24:08.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course they need money and who would blame them, I think the most played game so imagine the costs.

This has nothing to do with needing more money this is simply greed from Riot, the most played game argument is completely irrelevant.
