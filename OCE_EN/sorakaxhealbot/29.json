According to this post last whisper is now 1300 gold and penetrates 30% of bonus armor instead of total armor (kind of a nerf and at the same time a buff) and last whisper can now be built into two other items which increases the armor pen to 40% bonus armor and one of the two upgrade applies grievious wounds and the other upgrage gives a max of 15% extra damage on targets with 500 more hp than you. The next change which i feel is pretty significant is the change to runaan&#039;s hurricane which now gives 30% crit, 35% attacks speed, 5% movespeed and now the bolts can crit (bolts only deal 0.25AD per bolt now tho so its in a way a nerf but the crit is a huge buff imo).  Phantom dancer and Shiv gives pretty much the same stat now except they serve a different purpose because of their passives. Phantom dancer for 1v1 and shiv for maybe splitpush and waveclear. They both give 30% crit and around 35-40% attack speed. Essence reaver&#039;s now grants extra CDR base on your crit and if im right Essence Reaver by itself also gives you some crit but now essence reaver passive which gives mana only proc on crit strikes (Champions who can fully benefit from this item will undoubtedly become meta/the OP, Think Lucian). \r\n\r\nNow the champion changes which i think is really Op. Caitlyn might actually become the new tank killer because if she retains her current passive where Headshot ignores 50% of enemy bonus armor and if she buys a runaan&#039;s hurricane and an early last whisper .... because of the runaan&#039;s bolts she might be able to proc the passive every 2-3 auto attacks and tanks will probably be unplayable after this (because 80-90% bonus armor pen)...\r\nOther than that, Caitlyn&#039;s E and W if they hit someone will instantly proc a special headshot which will double her attack range (1300 auto range) on the netted or trapped target and this will make her a huge lane bully probably even over the top.\r\n\r\nNext champion change which i think is pretty OP is the kog&#039;maw W changes. Kog&#039;maw W doubles your attack speed and allow you to double the 2.5 AS cap to 5.0 and reduce your auto damage to deal 0.6AD but fully apply on hit effects. Think about how OP kog&#039;maw will be with a Blade of the ruined king and a runaan&#039;s hurricane. Kog&#039;maw will become heavilly auto attack based and might no longer build Trinity force (maybe) but maybe build a Essence reaver after Botrk and Runaan&#039;s Hurricane and boom now kog&#039;maw will probably have his W up most of the time. The double AS steroid of kog&#039;maw will probably cause kog&#039;maw to do the damage of 2 adc or maybe even 6 adc because of runaan&#039;s. \r\n\r\nNext is Miss fortune. He gets quite a huge change to her passive and her W. Her passive and W kinda swapped. Passive is called love tap and Grants Miss Fortune bonus damage when swapping targets. W passive is now known as Strut which after 5 seconds of not being in combat, Miss Fortune gains 25 flat Movement Speed, which increases to 60/70/80/90/100 after another 5 seconds (scale with level). The W active now grants 60/75/90/105/120% AS ... this is the op part, after this change Miss fortune might become a hypercarry. The bonus AS active only last 3s now tho which is halved from 6 but Love Tap [Passive ] extends the duration of the buff by 0.8 seconds every time Miss Fortune hits a different target (1.6 seconds for Champions). Not sure how runaan&#039;s will work with her passive and  W active. Her Ult can now crit and her E&#039;s range is increase slightly. I feel that this change to Miss Fortune is really nice because it gives her an identity of a teamfighting adc which is really nice.","replies":[]}
