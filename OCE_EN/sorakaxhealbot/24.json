He also have some nice AD scaling on his W on every 5th basic attack.

So will this work ?\n\nWith this build +  AS from runes and masteries (18.5% from runes and masteries) kennen will have around 211.3% attack speed at level 18. The math for the attack speed:\n\nkennen base AS = 0.69\nTotal AS from runes and masteries (%AS) = 153.5%\nKennen (%) AS at lvl 18 = 57.8% (3.4% per lvl) \n\nKennen AS at lvl 18 with full build and AS from runes and masteries \n= ((153.5 + 57.8)/100)+ 1)*(0.69)\n=3.113*0.69\n=2.14797\n","replies":[{"poster":"Yuudachi","date":"2015-07-18T09:28:14.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-07-18T10:00:01.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Crackdogrock,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=q4kwmtgF,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-07-18T09:28:14.815+0000)\n>\n> I don't think diving in straight up is the best idea for an adc\n\nDun worry i am not someone who R into the whole enemy team as kennen without a zhonya's hourglass which i might never get as an ADC although Zhonya doesn't sound bad as a defensive item if i need it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-07-18T10:18:14.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry m8 ad kennen is already a thing, it's played just about as much as ap kennen.","replies":[{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-07-18T10:47:42.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Thinker,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=q4kwmtgF,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-07-18T10:18:14.232+0000)\n>\n> Sorry m8 ad kennen is already a thing, it's played just about as much as ap kennen.\n\nyou sure about that ? i thought ppl play kennen as a top lane AP mage more than playing him as an ADC.","replies":[]}]}]}
