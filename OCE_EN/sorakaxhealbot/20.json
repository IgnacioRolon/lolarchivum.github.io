The build will go something like this, {{item:3031}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3035}} {{item:3046}} . Well im very sure some of you will say that it is stupid to not build a defensive item especially when you are an immobile adc like ashe. Lets say there are little to no threats (CC or anything that can assassinate you)  on the enemy team which allows you to build this way. Will this be a good idea ?","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-09-04T14:00:28.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends how good you can kite and how well your team can peel for you.","replies":[{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-09-04T17:33:05.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Unseen Predator,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=1ETrXkps,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-09-04T14:00:28.414+0000)\n>\n> Depends how good you can kite and how well your team can peel for you.\n\nJust wondering how much do you crit at full build ?","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-09-05T03:55:22.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My Rengar build? 55% with two IE or 85% with two PD, replacing boots for final item gives 90 if two IE but if two PD it's 100%.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lone Summoner","date":"2015-09-05T00:37:57.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about you just use {{item:3087}} instead that why you get the bonus AP damage and I don't know the differences in stats but it prob better if you got this item instead of the double {{item:3046}}.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-09-04T14:18:37.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is my standard build.
