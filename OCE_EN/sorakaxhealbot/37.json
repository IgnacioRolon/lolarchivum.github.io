What ISP do you use and what location are you playing from?  Do you connect your PC to your router via a cable or wifi?\n\nThere are lots of potential causes so I'd suggest you have a read over [this article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) if you haven't already and let me know how you go!\n\nCheers,\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-06-16T15:21:37.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I live in Perth.

And as Mindstar said. Just read the Article he posted and if it's still lagging. It's your ISP. I know somebody has TPG in Perth and he uses cable connection and it still lags him out of the game some times. Just have a go. And if worse comes to worse. Try to find a better ISP. I had to pitch a sales pitch to my Dad just to get him to change over to an ISP that was offering Fibre connections. But good luck. And see you on the Rift :D","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-18T14:24:43.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have good intentions.\n\nWifi has improved remarkably over the years. We're able to compare the speeds of Wifi to cables now. It's just gotten that good. It is *extremely* rare for a lag issue to have spawned from using Wifi instead of cable, and for those who do it's pretty damn obnoxious.\n\nYou shouldn't really be encouraging people to switch ISP for this. In the same vein that not all ISPs are good (ie. you should give them your business) Riot's servers aren't all good either. If you need to switch over ISPs for just one game, that's a lot of money/setup for just one game. It should be a last resort.\n\nMore often the issue is something trivial in the settings in the person's computer, such as it trying to use IPv6 instead of IPv4 or a crummy DNS. You should try out those things first, things that can just be changed via settings, before suggesting they rewire their house and get a new ISP.\n\nIn addition, Riot could probably improve OCE's framework.\n\nMan I'm tired.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Riot Cochese","date":"2015-06-18T02:31:17.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd definitely use a cable to connect to your router/modem.
