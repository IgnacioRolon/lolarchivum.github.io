What i notice is that Jinx, Vayne, Volibear and possibly more that i did not notice is not present on one of the schedule but present on the other. Can someone from Riot please tell me what is happening ?","replies":[{"poster":"GetSinged","date":"2015-07-03T15:43:10.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's because [this page](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales/july-champion-and-skin-sales) is for last years july sales, but [this page](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales/july-sales-schedule) is for this years july sales","replies":[]}]}
