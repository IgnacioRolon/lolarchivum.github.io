Also mercurial scimitar now gives life steal so it is also possible to see a mercurial rush ... i hate this new change ....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-10-29T07:52:46.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They've f*cked up Quinn, that's for dam sure.","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-10-29T08:07:37.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ironically they said the same about Garen.\n\nBut now Quinn can get 2 Vulnerable procs off with Aerial Assault and Vault and they scale off total AD which basically makes up for her losing the ability to blind and attack with Valor, her ult has amazing utility and now that Youmuu's is a viable first item rush now that it gives more AD Quinn will be better than ever.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-10-29T21:33:05.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except her blind is arguably her strongest mechanic. Currently, Quinn can handle a fed Yi no problem if the player knows what they're doing and get's their timing right. Same can be said for other similar champs (Trynd for example). With the change, that's no longer possible. It's either fight and die or try to escape with Vault and die, because you can't even use her ult to escape any more because it's got a 2 second channel.\n\nAnd the changes to her ult take away from her uniqueness. Half the reason I played her is because I got that \"Tag Team duo\" feel from using her ult. It felt right, and Valor being able to attack makes sense. Now it's a 2 second channel and you can't attack, it's pointless for everything except getting back to lane.\n\nSo what you can get another proc on Harrier? A good player wouldn't need that extra proc and it's just putting too much focus on the passive. Fact is, nothing will ever make up for the loss of Blinding Assault and I don't see anything making up for the changes to Tag Team as they stand now.","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2015-10-30T08:31:14.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see how the current ult is thematically on point.

How come Valor can't attack? I mean, the whole basis of \"Arial Assault\" is that Valor can attack, so why can't he while \"Tag Team\" is active? Also, how the f*ck can Valor carry Quinn? He's a bird and she's geared up, he can't carry that much unless he's several times larger than her, which also makes no sense since he lands on her arm in some of their emotes. And in all this Quinn can't attack while Valor is carrying her? They're supposed to be this epic \"Perfectly Matched\" duo but they can't even work together in the midst of a fight? Again, it makes no sense.\n\nAt least the way it is now Valor actually has some impact in combat (outside of Harrier), as he should.

He can carry her because she's probably incredibly light and he's incredibly strong. If he can blind people by simply flying into enemies I don't see why he can't carry her. Also he evidently changes size in the q, emotes and ult right now as it is. He's magic or something so you can't really argue with Runeterra logic.\n\n>And in all this Quinn can't attack while Valor is carrying her? They're supposed to be this epic \"Perfectly Matched\" duo but they can't even work together in the midst of a fight? Again, it makes no sense.\n\nHe stops carrying her so he can begin marking targets, flying into enemies and revealing them. He can't aerial assault if he's carrying her. It makes sense that he can't be in two places at once.\n\n>At least the way it is now Valor actually has some impact in combat (outside of Harrier), as he should. With the changes, that's simply not true.\n\nHe is always having an impact whether through harrier, aerial assault, reveal or carrying her. There isn't a single point where Quinn is ever fighting alone. Just because he's actually being a bird now instead of a brawler doesn't mean he has no impact.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-10-30T22:31:39.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I thought you meant her uniqueness was based on her thematically being two characters swapping.

With the changes Valor is nothing more than a tool.\n\n> He can carry her because she's probably incredibly light and he's incredibly strong.\n\nThen either she's anorexic or he's super-powered. And I would like to point out there is literally no evidence that Quinn and Valor use magic, it comes down to inconsistencies in the way Riot portrays Valor.\n\n> If he can blind people by simply flying into enemies\n\nHe doesn't though, he gouges their eyes. That's the whole basis of Blinding Assault. Hell, it's even in one of Quinn's quotes.\n\n> He stops carrying her so he can begin marking targets, flying into enemies and revealing them. He can't aerial assault if he's carrying her. It makes sense that he can't be in two places at once.\n\nAnd yet, he can reveal the area **WHILE** carrying her. Apparently he can be in two places at once. Also, no one said he had to \"Arial Assault\" while carrying Quinn, I was asking why **Quinn** can't attack while being carried.\n\n> He is always having an impact whether through harrier, aerial assault, reveal or carrying her.\n\nExcept both the Heightened Senses active and Ult will be nothing more than utility, having no impact on combat (essentially Valor has become a tool here). As for \"Arial Assault\", it's nothing more than a way to proc Harrier, so all of Valor's in-combat interactions are nothing more than Harrier marks.\n\n> Just because he's actually being a bird now instead of a brawler doesn't mean he has no impact.\n\nHe was a bird before the changes, now he's going to be a tool.","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2015-10-30T23:26:37.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">No, I was referring to the fact that they're supposed to be a fighting duo of champions. With the changes Valor is nothing more than a tool.\n\nThey've decided to have Kindred exist in that space now. Look, Valor still appears in every ability which is still a step above Tibbers and below Kindred.\n\n>literally no evidence that Quinn and Valor use magic\n\nI'm not suggesting that they use magic. I'm suggesting that in Runeterra some things can't be explained with real world logic.\n\n>He doesn't though, he gouges their eyes. That's the whole basis of Blinding Assault. Hell, it's even in one of Quinn's quotes.\n\nThat's true. Still, the animation is just flying into enemies which is more aerial than blinding.\n\n>And yet, he can reveal the area WHILE carrying her.\n\nBecause the animation is that he looks up. This is getting a bit comical.\n\n>Apparently he can be in two places at once.\n\nHe actually can if you q and he marks at the same time. Again, game logic.\n\n>having no impact on combat\n\nThat's one aspect of impact. Just because it's different doesn't mean it's non-existent.\n\n>He was a bird before the changes, now he's going to be a tool.\n\nHe was a brawler-bird before the changes and is now an assistant-bird. Never stopped being a bird.\n\nLook we can go forever on this but I think there's no point. You clearly care that Quinn & Valor stay as a duo who have equal impact. I'm just trying to defend the notion that Valor still exists. Even though I'm right in saying he does, I can't argue that he exists in the same capacity as before. Let's leave it at that.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-10-29T21:47:59.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh well, time will tell, we still don't know how big the AD ratio on her Harrier is.\n\nPlus she was bad for 2 seasons because of her ult putting her in melee range.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-10-29T21:58:18.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Plus she was bad for 2 seasons because of her ult putting her in melee range.\n\nAnd she's not the only champion who has that: Nidalee, Elise and Jayce just to name a few.

Other than that {{item:3031}}  is getting a nerf to the amount of AD it gives (not sure if the price goes down with it). The cool changes is that {{item:3508}}  has been buff and gives u more CDR the more crit you have which means AD caster especially {{champion:236}}  is gonna be extremely op after this change. Other than that changes to {{item:3085}} which now gives movespeed and crit and runaan's bolts will now crit. This will cause {{champion:429}}  to become OP. {{champion:21}} ult can now crit ...yes it can now crit. From what i see these changes will make a few of the adcs right now extremely OP especially {{champion:236}} {{champion:51}}  {{champion:133}} if you build an {{item:3508}} on them and {{champion:429}} with her runaan's hurricane build which now gives crit and movespeed as if kalista isn't already fast enough and the crit which make her late game a lot stronger.... \nChanges to {{champion:96}} W which doubles his attack speed and attack speed cap will make him spike insanely with a {{item:3153}} ...\n\nOne last thing {{item:3139}} now grants life steal ... so you might see some adc rushing this as first item and {{champion:238}} will become trash tier assassin after this change. Rip Zed. \n\nMy conclusion on this is that every other adc which cannot make use of essence reaver will probably be heavilly underpower and maybe not even played at all because they take a lot more time to spike and will probably be underpowered. According to [](http://www.newsoflegends.com/index.php/wip-red-posts-2810-preseason-48893/) post an {{item:3508}} and a {{item:3086}}  will give around 30% CDR    ... this means Lucian will spike like crazy with an Essence reaver and a Zeal.  \n\ni feel that these changes are over the top and is absolutely gamebreaking.","replies":[]}]}
