His attack animation feels a lot worst than how it was before patch 5.22 and the base damage on his W is completely gone and now has a mana cost and his ult doesn&#039;t deal as much damage as before making lvl6 a lot lest of a power spike. Pretty sure his base attack speed and base health and maybe even base ad got nerfed. According to http://champion.gg/champion/KogMaw/ADC kog&#039;maw damage dealt dropped from the highest among all adc to the second lowest among all adc. His win rate is 39.14% currently. Pretty sure win rate doesn&#039;t mean much when it comes to how powerful a champion is but when win rates drop below 40% there is obviously something wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-17T23:59:37.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its because his damage is crap without a full build","replies":[{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-11-18T00:57:08.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Iq9htUcb,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-11-17T23:59:37.233+0000)\n>\n> its because his damage is crap without a full build\n\nThat is true but the real problem with kogmaw is with the base damage removal to his w. His W use to do if I'm right 6% max health magic damage at max level. Now his W do less than 2% max health magic damage. His base hp nerf is pretty huge too because his lane phase is a lot worst than pre 5.22 kogmaw.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-18T01:36:38.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i wan't old kog back ;-;\n\nhis w used to be 6% yes\n\n2/3/4/5/6\n\nbut now it only averages at like 1.2-2.2% hp, which is useless, even with 5.00 attackspeed, the 45% damage reduction makes his normal damage pretty useless as well.","replies":[{"poster":"KagamiArata","date":"2015-11-18T03:44:23.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly i would deal a lot more damage as old kog'maw compared to new kog'maw. When trading in lane as old kogmaw you will always press W and spit at the enemies. Now if you use W when trading you are probably gonna lose dps if they hide in the bush because of that 45% damage reduction. His W base dmg is gone now and at early levels the percent health damage does absolutely nothing (it deals like 2 to 6 health per auto which is pathetic). New kogmaw also takes years to start scaling in terms of damage. Old kogmaw spike like crazy with a Trinity force while on new kogmaw i need blade of ruined king, runaan's and Infinity edge to even start to tickle the enemy tank. Other than that he has problems managing his mana right now because his W cost mana. His siege power is also a hell lot weaker now that his Ult base damage and scaling has been nerfed. Other than that with W up you are immobile as hell and can't kite which sucks a lot.\n\nNote: SorakaXHealbot is my main acc xD","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-18T09:31:42.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no, i found it averages on 4 damage.\n\nAnd yes, i would say trades run off better early game if he doesn't use w.\n\nAnd rito did overdo his mana costs. He can now legit only use 1 qwe and r then he runs out of mana. He doesn't scale very well till 5/6th item either. I totally agree he was so much stronger before, reaching the power spike when he got a trinity, where he won most 1v1 duels","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SirArcticWarfare","date":"2015-11-17T09:33:48.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think every one is aiming for the 5 attacks a second, with no regard for dmg, def and sustain","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-11-17T22:38:47.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"lel","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-11-17T13:32:15.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hint: In pro play and non-solo play he would be broken, no one understands that Kog'maw needs to be played in a comp that can protect him.\n\nExample: Put kog'maw with braum and he rises to a 42.2% win rate","replies":[]}]}
