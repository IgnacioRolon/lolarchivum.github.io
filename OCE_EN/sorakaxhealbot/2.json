But do you think Blue Ezreal will be good against the juggernauts especially after the rework of randuin's omen where it now reduces crit damage by 10% (Blue Ez doesn't rely much on crit) and the addition of {{item:3742}} to the game which made it difficult for range champions to kite melee champions.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-13T08:23:58.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is i would actually say Blue ez can't be played against a skarner because of the fact that essence reaver is required as an item purchase and there is no way to actually build around that.
