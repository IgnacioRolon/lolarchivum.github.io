Even though this is compensated by adding a passive attack speed on W i still think this is a nerfed at least to Azir&#039;s Early game because most if not all Azir players will max Q first. Also the E knockup on impact being remove feels really unnecessary ... could someone pls explain to me why is there a need to nerf Azir. I had played him a few times before when he is in the free champion rotation and i feel he is very balanced the way it is right now. Is there really a need for the Azir nerfs !?","replies":[{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-07-20T09:09:26.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh God that HUD is fucking cancer, please tell me theirs a legacy option, I am not playing with that garbage.","replies":[{"poster":"Capt Ahmad","date":"2015-07-22T16:00:03.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People don't like change, and mind you, the HUD will soon be permanent :/\nBut no worries, as you'll get used to it after a few games {{summoner:3}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-07-20T09:09:47.856+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"TBH anything Rito nerfs or buffs is actually in need of it period.","replies":[{"poster":"Capt Ahmad","date":"2015-07-22T15:56:09.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"ANYTHING\"?!

I remember the 1st time i played Azir in a bot game and i was feeding (its beginner bots ...) but after reading what his skills does and watching a guide on youtube i start to really enjoy playing Azir. What i dislike is the nerf on his passive which im very sure will negatively affects Azir's laning phase and mid game especially when he doesn't have the best laning phase due to early mana issues and delays his power spike to around lvl 12 or 13.  Azir is actually pretty Op if you know how to play him. The reason behind Azir being good in this tank meta (which should be ending soon) is that Azir deals sustained damage and not burst damage and once he get his core items with 40% CDR he gets really really powerful. Azir is like a second ADC except that he deals magic damage \"auto attack\" and  Rylai's works on his soldier's attacks. What Riot needs to do is just lower his base damage or his Ap scaling by a little. I really dislike the removal of the knockup on his E because i tend to use the knockup a lot.","replies":[]}]}]}
