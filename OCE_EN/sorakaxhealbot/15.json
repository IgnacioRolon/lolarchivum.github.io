This doesn&#039;t make any sense at all because all champions that are labelled as a tank and is melee all have at least about 53MR at lvl18.

If Maokai gains health from enemies spell cast means he shouldn't gain MR from leveling then why Galio have a MR growth stat ?","replies":[{"poster":"ScrubCloud","date":"2016-01-27T00:05:12.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because Galio passive?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-01-27T16:10:54.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh never noticed. i thought after a certain patch all melees have MR growth. i think if they nerf him in other ways maybe they could give it to him and he could be....well not better but more in line with all the other melees, so says my OCD","replies":[{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2016-01-27T18:29:13.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GigaPube,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=AZfhcsqZ,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-01-27T16:10:54.307+0000)\n>\n> oh never noticed. i thought after a certain patch all melees have MR growth. i think if they nerf him in other ways maybe they could give it to him and he could be....well not better but more in line with all the other melees, so says my OCD\n\nAll melee's except Kassadin, Yasuo and Sadly Maokai.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-01-27T18:37:06.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"kassadin has inbuilt MR i guess. so this is how yas has been kept not-op for...for a bit","replies":[]}]}]}]}
