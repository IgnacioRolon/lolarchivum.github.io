He is a disgusting champion and has a horrible playstyle and game mechanics. Teemo should be torn apart and Riot should implement certain of his abilities on a new champion/s.\r\nNow Riven. Riven is an utterly overplayed and OP champion which destroys mostly everyone in the top lane. I do not think she needs to be removed but she definitely needs to be nerfed hard so people playing her have to press more the R, Q, Q, Q, Q to kill an opposing champion. While yes it may be incredibly fun to be the one playing her, it can and will make the game very unenjoyable for the entire opposing team.\r\nFizz is a huge lane bully and is extremely hard to gank. His ability to potentionally 2 shot someone is okay I guess but he needs much larger cool downs to make it so he can't stay in the fight dodging everyone skillshots and wasting the enemy teams abilities.\r\nAkali is an insane brute force of power who needs to be turned down more than a notch. The fact that she doesn't have to farm and can be killed several times in lane and still be able to get a triple kill at level 6 is filthy. I have played Cho'Gath many times against her and destroyed her in lane, although she can just run off to any other lane and get a triple kill by herself! She is the meaning of overpowered and should be nerfed hard.\r\nThe saddest part about these champions is that they are not hard at all to play. You could buy them and have a first game in ranked and go positive easily.","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-01-17T13:38:28.151+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Look at me I'm a salty scrub\" -*OP*","replies":[]},{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-01-19T14:48:56.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fizz","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chesse Blob","date":"2015-01-17T22:12:39.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"%%%%ing fizz  btw I wanna see more yoricks :D cause yorick is OP{{champion:83}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-01-17T06:03:02.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play Rek'Sai against her you win once you have hydra","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lauricella3","date":"2015-01-16T09:53:57.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"definitely fizz, his e does too much damage for how little counter-play it has or the dot needs on his w needs to be swapped with the active or removed entirely. kinda bs how he can kill you with just qwe (after missing his ult) so early on.","replies":[]}]}
