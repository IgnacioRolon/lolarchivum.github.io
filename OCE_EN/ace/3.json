Wondering if this is an issue on Riots or my end. Oh and if anyone knows of a way to reduce the chances of this happening again that would be appreciated.\n\nThanks~\n \nEdit: I forgot to mention the client will randomly glitch out in champ select and things will be everywhere i'll see if I can get a screenshot of it if it happens again. https://gyazo.com/488af474153b9867038fae87c1d193d1","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-08-13T04:00:59.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThis sounds like it might be connection related.\n\nCould you please run through everything outlined in the [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) support article for me and let me know if anything helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Ace","date":"2016-08-13T07:36:03.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey i'll run a repair tonight and If doesn't fix the problems i'll go through the link you sent properly.
