Thinking it was just the servers not responding I try to relog, as I log back in it says reconnect only to have a black screen or as some would call it a &quot;ghost game&quot;. I wait an hour and still nothing, at this stage it was late at night so I decided to just go to bed and fix it in the morning. I managed to get on and play but the Sivir game that I played still didn&#039;t contribute to my LP or match history. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m not asking for much just want to know what happened and if it&#039;s an issue on my end or Riots? 乁( ͠&deg;_ &deg;)ㄏ\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-07-24T09:26:12.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nSometimes this can occur if there are server sided issues at the time of the game, the match will not properly be recorded and any LP gains/losses will not be applied.\n\nSometimes the match does eventually appear, however this usually happens within 48 hours. If this match has not appeared then it is unfortunately lost, gone with the wind.\n\nSorry about that.","replies":[]}]}
