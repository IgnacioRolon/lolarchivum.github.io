Some people may say something along the lines of &quot;oh you shouldn&#039;t have wasted them&quot; or &quot; that&#039;s why we only get three use them wisely&quot;, I agree though I regret using mine the way I did. \r\n\r\nThanks for any feedback and or opinions!{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-06-18T09:04:17.000+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used all mine before I was level 20, though I have to admit we should get more refunds every Season, but what Riot should do is you get your RP back, they keep the money but you lose the thing you bought. Maybe 3 every season, at a cap of 3, but you can only refund things you bought that season.\n\nSo Riot doesn't lose any many but if you have a garbage skin that you bought THAT season, you can trade it for something else.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ErÃ¸se","date":"2016-06-20T22:12:44.992+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought we get 3 refunds every season so i used up all of mine.
