I was wondering if Riot could possibly add something else that we can do with Blue Shards other than using them to make champions, I&#039;m not sure how hard it would be to do that but I do think this would be a nice implementation to the Hextech Crafting System.\n\nThanks, \nAce{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2016-03-31T13:15:09.271+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it would be cool if they could be used for enchanting chests so you are guaranteed a skin shard or something","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-03-31T11:27:37.185+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also have all the champs, so its useless to me too, Riot said that they want to try find a use for people who have all the champs...\nbut tbh that means it'll never happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beeblebob","date":"2016-06-30T12:17:10.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If re-rolling them was guaranteed to get you a champ you didn't have I wouldn't mind.
