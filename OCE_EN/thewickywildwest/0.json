My ping is around 60ms and I get about 100fps. Champions and minions are teleporting everywhere but I&#039;m moving smoothly. I described whats going on in lane to my friend and he&#039;d tell me that extremely different things were happening on his screen. For him the enemy would be beating me under tower, but on my screen I&#039;d be in lane alone. Chat doesn&#039;t show up until a few minutes after whats been said and when my friend said that I&#039;d died, it wouldn&#039;t actually say I&#039;d died until a little later. After I died on his screen, I would occasionally teleport back and forth from spawn to lane but I wouldn&#039;t actually be dead until it came up on my screen. Minions wont spawn until around 4 minutes, first blood comes up ages after my friend says it has and when I level up an ability it takes 2 levels to take effect.   \nI&#039;m in the same place on both of our screens so he can give me a good idea of whats happening to me so I can move, I&#039;ve been randomly pressing w in lane under tower hoping that it does something. The game is pretty much unplayable at this point. This has happened for 2 games in a row, both as Sona support, and its really pissing me off. Disconnecting and reconnecting does nothing to help either. It does this in custom games also.\nPlease help me.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-11T01:13:05.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys,\n\nIt's possible you're experiencing high packet loss and/or packet buffering, I recommend you both take a look at the [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) page, specifically attempt the fixes outlined under the [Packet Buffering](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq7) and [Packet Loss](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq6) headings.\n\nHope this helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Greks","date":"2016-01-10T13:10:16.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the same boat here for roughly the last month, with s6 around the corner, i hope this is fixed.","replies":[]}]}
