Everyone in the entire world becomes unranked with zero wins. Simple.\n\nTo be a bit more technically, your past rank has some input on exactly who you verse when you redo your placement matches i.e. if you were Gold 5 then you'll probably verse high Silvers and low Golds in your placements (or at least, people who were that division last season.)\n\nFor your account which was in placements, then it'll just go back to zero wins. You'll just start it from the start.\n\nHope that clears it up.","replies":[]}]}
