Honestly, I don&#039;t care if you are bronze, or silver, but if you are serious, have a will to improve and play often, hit me up with a message here or in game. I can play whatever role, and as such can focus on improving a lane/pool of champs that would complement the duo partner (if they already main a lane/pool of champs). \r\nCheers. \r\nIGN: Wackman.","replies":[{"poster":"craff3","date":"2015-10-13T09:34:23.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I would love to duo with you, I'm on silver 2 and keen for reaching gold by the end of the season.
