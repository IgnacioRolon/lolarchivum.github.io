But if you think as it is now and you get up to gold+ you gonna do well, then u are sadly mistaken. You will get destroy in lane and out rotated. Trolls, afk, exsit in every elo bracket. But if you dont belong in that tier you will climb out easy. At bronze it not your team, its not afk, trolls that held you back. Its you.\n\nYou are not at challenger tier where team work is more depended on. You are at bronze where people cant even cs right, use their skills right, build bad items have very little understanding on match up and start throwing insult if their laner die more than 1. Hit me up in game if you want tips.","replies":[{"poster":"Wackman","date":"2015-04-07T05:32:44.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers. Yeah I know I would get destroyed, I'm not looking to be in gold because of somebody getting me there, but somebody helping me get myself there. I just need help on scenario builds, decision making, and also constructive criticism on my mechanics.

Plus, I don't play hyper-carry champs. \nI know you get the same amount approx. of trolls and toxicity as you go up, but its a fact in everything that if you go at a higher standard you improve far more than at a lower standard.

Really gotta work on last hitting. I mean i am getting to the point when i'm at around 7 cs/min with Cho, which is better than my other landes.\nG) I really do want to get better. Sure, I don't mind if i'm winning, i just want to improve. I've been working for the last two months on all of these things (after my coach stopped playing), but i got frustrated with the game, and kind of threw the focus on mechanics out the window. But last two games I've been back on it.
