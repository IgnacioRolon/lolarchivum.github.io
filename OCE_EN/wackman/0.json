I finished last offseason at S3, but now I'm fluctuating between B2 and B3 (currently in B3). So, I'm looking for someone MATURE, half decent at the game, and keen to get out of bronze (or to help me out of bronze) to duo with me. \nNote: If you were to help me out of bronze, I would prefer helping me get better, rather than carrying me. \nHowever, if there is a like minded person who wants to get out bronze let me know and I'll be keen to play.\n\nCheers.\n\nPs. My IGN is Wackman and I play Top/Jung/Supp, but can play others if need be.","replies":[{"poster":"Lobos","date":"2015-02-22T15:48:27.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i got ranked bronze 1 but then lost so many games after that i got deranked to bronze 4, hoping to get out of bronze. add me and we can test our duo-ness :)\n\nLobos","replies":[]}]}
