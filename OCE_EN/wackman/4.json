However, in the post game stats I had 199 cs. This has happened every game. Not sure if it happens over the 25 minutes mark in all games, because it did drop to 199 and stayed there for the final 2 mins regardless of how much I was using. But yeah, just a heads up.. have no idea whats wrong.\r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-11-14T09:20:29.704+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk the post game stats include jungle monsters, so if you took raptors before showing up for a team fight then it wouldn't show up. Try checking it in the stats again and compare the jungle monsters slain as well.","replies":[]}]}
