Since starting season 6, we have literally had two occasions where the queue time has been 0 seconds. Not sure how this is possible, but I&#039;m not going to complain about it. Haha. No trolls or toxicity in the 15 games I&#039;ve played so far, which is great. \r\nHowever, the new season is highly in the favour of pre-made games, especially 5 man. Solo queue has become substantially harder due to the communication advantage, so guys add me :) (silver 2 last season). \r\nAlso, I cannot access my ranked stats for some reason. Not the end of the world, but would top of a nice start to season 6.","replies":[]}
