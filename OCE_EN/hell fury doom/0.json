This is a FAILURE added by the games ADMIN(whatever) that ultimate just annoys people they would have play their game. \r\n\r\nCore reason: consequence is for LEAVING a game, not ABANDONING a game. \r\n\r\nLeaving can be caused unintentionally by technical issues both by players related hardware (internet probs) and other FAILURES that I know I get now and then that are the result of the riot servers or maybe the LOL client system (NO IDEA WHICH IS TO BLAME) disconnecting me and failing to load or even add me to the lobby of a game I tried to join via matchmaking. Both result in a time penalty as a leaver. With no way to determine if a game was abandoned or simply a result of technical failure somewhere therefore the game SHOULD NOT have a penalty system where the punishment is actually JUST an annoyance.\r\n\r\nOnce annoyances are realized games become less attractive. &lt;marketing failure)= don&#039;t put stuff in a game that makes people NOT want to play it, that&#039;s just stupid) There is literally no possible argument that cannot be beaten simply with the above reality. That there is no way to determine whether a game was abandoned or a resulted disconnection from problematic sauces.\r\n\r\nDOTA 2 has MANY of these annoyances but, the game is significantly better than LOL, primarily it&#039;s really bad un-policed reporting systems (total trash). \r\nYet DOTA 2 in a small way can determine if a game is abandoned by simply taking into account whether or not the missing player is still logged into STEAM.\r\nLOL cannot do that.\r\n\r\nThus consequences for leaving should be removed from the game.\r\n\r\n(basic arguments: don&#039;t put a system in that can and will punish good players just to punish bad ones,....EG; DOTA 2 reporting system)","replies":[{"poster":"hell fury doom","date":"2015-12-01T02:55:05.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your post is wrong. Nothing wrong with my net or ISP for that matter and my DC isn't the topic of the discussion. \n\nFor your information tho my client fails once every now and then just cause of MATCHMAKING problems that's literally it. \nSpecific example: (to memory this is what happens most of the time) start matchmaking, matchmaking finds game, I press accept, (game is accepted by all) nothing happens (I'm left at normal home screen as seen before activating matchmaking, I can even begin matchmaking again and eventually I get a pop up notice saying you are already in a lobby (or like that) (IF I do matchmaking again) with the inevitable notification letting you know you have abandon a game.\n\nNow this discussion isn't about the above problem. This is about the game failure of leave penalties that the above problem is only one effect that is abusing. The way anyone that should be reading this discussion is not about the BAD PLAYERS or SOOKY LEAVERS etc.. it's about the fact that the game penalises you for having your POWER go out, your computer crash, your net provider fail to provide (due to even more technical problems) ETC...\n\nI thought this was a straight forward enough topic of discussion I still have not to my understanding NOT repeated myself for what was already posted in the first post.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-12-01T03:52:24.109+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like someone hasn't read the TOU and EULA.\n\nFACT:\nIt is **SOLELY** the players responsibility to ensure their computer meets the software, hardware and connection requirements of the game.

This can be caused by power outage, ISP issues, computer issues, real life emergencies ETC. It does not, however, account for **EXCESSIVE** disconnecting for **ANY** reason, and for good reason.

Removing punishments for disconnects (you have to be afk for 5mins for the warning to come up) would allow people who regularly disconnect (for any reason) to more often than not, ruin the game and team experience for four other players.\n\nTL;DR if you keep playing with connection issues but don't want to sort them out and don't like getting your butt leaver busted, don't play ♥","replies":[]}]}
