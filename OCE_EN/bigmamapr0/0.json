Every bronze/silver jungler that complains on this page always plays warwick. I even fell for this. \nWarwick, graves, xin, and rengar all have unique play styles. You need to be focusing on learning the game rather than just playing your champion. So many people (legit i get triggered) that play warwick just abuse his mechanics and think they're good when they're actually just playing him sub-optimally. I played warwick purely from silver 2 to gold 3 and when i played anything else it was an autoloss. I accepted that warwick was freelo but i wasn't actually good at the game so i played a variety of different champs, now im back to gold 3 mmr but im not relying on an op noob stomper. \n\nI would suggest playing champions like sej,j4,jax,shyvanna. They are strong and will teach you to focus on winning the game rather than just playing the champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LÃºcky","date":"2018-03-17T06:11:09.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bro, I got placed in silver v and now I'm silver 1 just play JG Vi or Master Yi easy wins","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-03-17T02:39:56.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"stop jumping around on your champions. play 1 or 2 and get really good at them.\n\nLegit, if you start playing Warwick only for 5-10 games in a row, you will notice a difference. You will understand the champion a lot more and understand how your champion can carry alot better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-03-17T02:36:32.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your problems isnt champs select. Your problems is how you play. For example, most of your games you have really low contribution scores, that is telling me a few things, you farm jgl too much, and not ganking or warding correctly. \n\nMost of your games i can predict that you rely on your team to win lane. If they lose lane, then the game goes down hill fast! \n\nAlso if you think ganking top lane in 5mins time, is a good idea then wow ok dude. Most kill lane, the lane is decide in the 1st 3mins. Knowing match up gank priority is a big part of being a good jgler. You lack a lots of knowledge and it would take way too much to coach you just by typing.","replies":[]}]}
