Thing is, one of the requirements of summoner names is that they don't cause people to think you're associated with Riot if you aren't and \"Rito\", while not the same as \"Riot\", could still cause people to think that. After all it's not that uncommon for people to refer to Riot as Rito (as I'm sure you are aware), and someone who reads it fast might read it as \"Riot\" because that's what they're used to seeing (this actually happened to me once, and I did report them for their name knowing it was spelt \"Rito\").","replies":[]}]}
