For instance every now and then when my net crashes during a game I have to completely restart the league client to get it to re connect to the Internet. \n\nAs far as the client is concerned I quit while it was trying to reconnect. \n\nI do think it's a nifty idea though.

If the player intentionally left, they're likely not coming back. If they got DCed, they'll likely try to reconnect.
