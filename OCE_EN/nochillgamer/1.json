I couldn&#039;t get any screenshots of this for some reason, I tried to but it didn&#039;t seem to work.","replies":[{"poster":"nochillgamer","date":"2016-12-09T08:11:56.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No it wasnt someone IN GAME and it wasn't a summoner name, it was a legitiment message from riot games.
