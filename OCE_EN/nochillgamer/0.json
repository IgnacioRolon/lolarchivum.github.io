I've gotten a lot of his skins via mystery gift so I don't imagine the bundle will cost all that much for me. The one I want is Tundra Hunter though so probs won't bother with the bundle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-01-11T12:37:40.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bring back urf the champion","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-01-10T23:58:19.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would doubt it, bringing back special skins is not something Riot likes doing, because of their commitment to the original owners.\nGrey WW is also a special skin that I would consider unlikely that they bring back. _(I think they should bring both back, but i don't really get a say in the matter.)_\n\nBut I really hope they do, I've been after that Urf skin since the first day I was aware of it.","replies":[]}]}
