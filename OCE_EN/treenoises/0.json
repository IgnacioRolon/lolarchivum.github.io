For new players this is really nice because they tend not want to buy RP to buy specific champions they like, and lack the IP to buy them outright. However, for level 30&#039;s who have got a small pool of champions and have a much better understanding of the game, and who are now looking to play ranked: still don&#039;t have enough IP to buy more than a couple of champions and so would be looking to deepen they&#039;r champion pool. Although free week does give them the opportunity to be exposed to new champs and pick them up, by level 30 you should have a semi good idea of your play style and preferred champion type, or even know the champion you want to main.\n\n >What I suggest to add to the free champion rotation, is that each week, at the start of the week, you can lock in 1 champ of your choice, out of all 126, and this champion is now unlocked for the next week. After that, you can choose the same champ for up to 2 weeks in a row, and then you can&#039;t use if as your free champion choice again for the next month.\n\nThis would let players who don&#039;t yet want to spend RP and haven&#039;t got the time or don&#039;t want to grind for IP, but want to try out new champions, to get the exposure/experience with the champs of they&#039;r choice, and then decide wether or not to buy them, instead of buying them with IP or RP and then hating the champion, but being stuck with them and the feeling of having wasted all that IP/RP. And by not making it usable on the same champion repetitively it forces people to choose carefully who they pick, and only gives them limited time to play them. \n\n\n\n-treeNoises","replies":[{"poster":"Robo23","date":"2015-10-02T09:12:29.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nearly every free week it seems on boards there is a champ that needs a nerf since they are so op.

And you can still only ever have 1 darius or riven per game.

Also I think making it only a 1 week trial period so its still like the free champ rotation except you choose which one. The only problem I see with this is if you just go through and activate all of the \"try champ\" options and then have a week of free champs then lose all of them, so maybe you can only have 1 active at a time, or can only change your choice once per week.\n\n-treeNoises","replies":[]}]}]}
