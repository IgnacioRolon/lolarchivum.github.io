Its been a long time since we got the oce server (5 years) and we were told that we wouldn&#039;t get TT as a full time fixture for a while. It has been a while and the server seems to have grown quite a bit, maybe its time we finally got TT as a full time gamemode, instead of set times at certain times of the week","replies":[{"poster":"JayJ","date":"2018-10-27T05:09:34.523+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe it should be up more often at the least, I can see the problems with having it up all the time, but not everyone can play at the times TT is active and this can make it quite difficult to progress in ranked or to enjoy the mode.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Red Denim","date":"2018-10-26T20:11:34.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im not sure it could be sustained all year round - but towards the end of the season I do think it should be more available.
