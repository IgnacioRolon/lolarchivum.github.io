However, when I go to buy a 3150 champion (or anything cheaper), it gives me the option to purchase it with IP. I&#039;ve tried resetting my client several times, played a few games to get more IP, and have waited for 9 hours, and still nothing, please help.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-12-06T06:38:16.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nIf you're still experiencing this issue, please [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) to Player Support.\n\nWe here on the boards are unable to assist with account specific inquiries.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Th0mas99","date":"2016-12-04T04:26:50.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The same kind of thing is happening to me right now","replies":[]}]}
