Gold income item. Ancient Coin or Face of the Mountain\nItem 2. Boots: Mobility Boots (Blue Enhancement), or Ninja Tabi (Green Enhancement), or Mercury's Treads (Green Enhancement). \nItem 3. Sightstone \nItem 4. Mikael's Crucible \nItem 5. Frozen Heart\nItem 6. Randuins\n\nBut I also run a wide variety of different builds on Blitzcrank.\nThe best way to build Blitzcrank or any support and just any champion in the game is to build situationally. No point building a Spirit Visage if the enemy has no Ability Power. \n\nNote: I see the potential with Iceborn Gauntlet but I personally think it's a waste of a good item.","replies":[{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-02-02T04:20:07.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not enough AP.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-02-01T10:55:28.764+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"build him like thresh, but with mana.\nplay him like thresh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-02-01T21:23:00.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Feral flare - sorc shoes once ur lv 6, sunfire, triforce...\n\nThis is jg.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PlayDis","date":"2015-02-01T14:01:19.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"try looking at some guides off here\nhttp://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/blitzcrank-guide\n\nIf you're bad at pulling enemy champions, try building move speed and cdr early to ensure your in range.\nThere's no perfect way to building items as it is situational on your team's champions and the enemies'.\nIf your team doesn't have good engage, try going for {{item:3069}} or {{item:3800}} or {{item:3056}} .\nIf the enemy has high mobility, then {{item:3025}} and {{item:3143}} are great when you engage, so you can slow them down.\nIn many cases, I reckon {{item:3143}}  is better than {{item:3110}}  for its pure HP rather than relying on your passive.\n{{item:3222}}  is good when enemy team has a lot of cc.\nTry not to pull their engagers/tanks ofc ;)\n\nUsually blitz goes support with an adc","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-02-01T09:09:01.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"depends what role you are playing him.

Those are both excellent items for Blitzcrank. However, it sounds like you are rushing those two items no matter what the team comp is. Early armour is always good for a tank support, don't get me wrong, but don't rush too much of it it they are full of magic damage.\nApart from that though, you are playing support Blitz. If you are playing him as a tank, just tank up. They have lots of magic damage? Get some MR. What you build as a tank is always gonna depend on the enemy team comp, so you shouldn't have a totally set build path.\nAlso, Sightstone early. Boots are something you have choice with too. Mobi boots are great for getting in position to land hooks, of course. Some people go for Lucidity boots (why not). Your other main choice is Ninja Tabi or Merc Treads. Even if they somehow have no magic damage though, Merc Treads help so much against any CC.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TimFromAccountng","date":"2015-02-01T10:26:27.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Start the game.\nPut a point in Q.\nMiss 20.\nHit 1, win game.","replies":[]}]}
