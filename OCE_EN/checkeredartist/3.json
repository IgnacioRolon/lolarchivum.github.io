I used to max Q but then I got a Lulu v Lulu matchup and the E max screwed us over (damn normals). From there I'd recommend only harassing with Q, not E even though it deals more damage, save the E for when you or your adc are getting hit. Polymorph is ridiculously strong so max it second and use it either to get free harass or as a way to shut down any enemies trying to get onto your carries. Lulu is very good at keeping your carries alive so try to prioritise it over dealing damage yourself.\nIn regards to the poking and overextending, that's unfortunately something that you learn just by playing the game. If you're worried and your adc is content to just farm as they're not poking you back, just go with the flow.\nIn the late game, try to stick around your carries (hopefully your adc if they get fed) and peel for them with your ult and E which basically makes them very hard to kill in equal numbered fights even when you're behind.\nAs for warding, yes I know it's hard especially when nobody else does it but just try to persevere, keep buying control wards even if they get cleared constantly (try for buying and placing at least 3 per game).\nFor your build one of the most popular ones is going with {{item:2301}} then {{item:3107}} ,{{item:3190}} ,{{item:3117}}  or {{item:3158}} , {{item:3504}}  and then often a {{item:3222}}  or even {{item:3512}} . This gives you a lot of cdr so your E and ult are up a lot more often.\nTry to take Windspeakers blessing as your keystone, with Intelligence and Insight also being quite useful (more cdr).\nGet a full Rune page as these help heaps even without you realising. There's a lot of mixed opinions on this but I quite like flat AD or magic pen reds, flat armour or scaling health yellows, flat MR or AP blues, and flat AP quints. (Take flat armour quints if you take the scaling health seals.)\nSorry for the long post, hope it helps you in some way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-02-25T10:24:42.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"firstly, get a mate to help you in the early stages of lulu if its this bad, i know i had a few troubles with lulu when i play her when shes free (cuz i can), anyway, in my situation i often get my w and e confused, but one thing i know about lulu, to get those Q's easier to land, try to polymorph an enemy, then pix will be on them so u can cast the Q with 100% chance to hit them, and potentially another enemy, for extra risk for reward, try to cast your q in range as well for twice the chance to hit someone\nfrom another support main, whose finally out of the support harassment phase of becoming a support main,\n {{champion:14}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:12}} {{item:3401}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3009}} {{item:3022}} {{item:3109}} {{item:3748}}  (titanic is only cuz i forgot what my last item was XD)","replies":[]}]}
