Logic.\nI can KS 12 kills as Azir too if I wanted, that still doesn't make me a feeder? and I'm pretty sure you called him a feeder.\n\nYou just said you cant play Yasuo if you think he is an assassin, now you're saying he CAN be an assassin, but its just not as effective.\nWhich is it?\n\nIn any case, Yasuo fighter and Assassin are the same thing, fighter Yasuo deals 650-800ish damage per auto depending on how tanky you build him, and slightly more with his Q. He autos you 3 or 4 times and Q's maybe twice in a total of 4 seconds, (thats at minimum 4000 damage in 4 seconds.) in his damage output is very similar to Talon's in the same ammount of time, and is far far far greater than Kassadin's.\n\nSo you can be a fighter but do assassin level damage, which makes you an assassin, even if you are building fighter.\n\nHis 'entrance' can be either his E or Ult (thats 2x more entrances than most assassins have.)\nAnd his exit seems to be pretty damn reliable whenever I'm using it, and I'm not even a particularly good Yasuo.\nHis exit is more reliable than Talon's is, (slowly jumping over a wall, IF there even is a wall for you to jump).\nand far more reliable than Rengar's exit.\n\nPlus, dont shit talk his E until you play Kalista, \neverything that stops his E stops her jump as well, but not only that, her jump can be slowed too. She is also less tanky, does less damage, doesn't have a wind wall to protect her, AND her dash isn't instant like his, it needs a wind up.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-11T07:25:43.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo feeding is a general statement, you of all people should know that, its the real reason people ban him, they simply don't want him on **THEIR OWN** team.\n\nAnd as for kalista, its stopped during the windup or a knockup, once the dash occurs it continues. Yasuo's dash is also affected by slowing effects, and if he tries to \"enter\" a fight with his e, unless he has the best freaking reflexes in that said game he is a goner.\n\nAlso like how you just blow over zed, fizz, kat, leblanc and kha with your argument.\n\nAlso **LOVE** how you get 4000 out of nowhere, and a **MINIMUM** at that, you make me laugh. On average with infinity edge and a full ad build he only does 800 to minions. Love this 4k min crap that comes from no where, if he is building tanky, the tend to stop at ~1.4 aa speed and only have around 250 ad. \n\nHis q does 187.5% damage on crit and his normal attacks do 225%\n\n4 sec allows 3 q, q has a 75% reduction, and if you didn't know the 100 base cannot crit, only the scale can, making a non crit do 350 and a crit do 568.75, his basic attacks have 10% reduction, making crits with an ie to 225% damage, which do 250 non crit and 562.5 on crit.\n\n1.4 aa speed will get him 3 auto attacks, if he can animation cancel with his q to perfection, otherwise 2 due to a 4.2 sec for 3 attacks, assuming the yasuo cancels properly (needing to use sweeping blade, which is the only cancel, though takes .5 sec to finish cast taking away any chance of more than 3 autos (aa q aa q aa q) and gets 3 auto attacks off the yasuo will do (562.5*****3) 1687.5 damage before reduction, and is q will do (568.5*****3) 1706.25 damage before reduction, these come together to cause 3393.75 damage in total before reduction, as theoretical damage.\n\nHis q has a set cast time of .71 seconds without any bonus ad, this boils down to a minimum of 0.18 at 1.74 aa speed, leaving an approximate, the reduction to cast time given by 1.4 aa speed is only 53% of the total reduction, leaving his q cast time at 0.376 seconds rounded down, (1.33*****2+0.376*****2) 3.412  seconds to cast his q twice he can fit 1 auto between each cast of the spell. So, unless that yasuo starts his fight with an aa then immediately on damage application of his auto uses his q and weaves, he will do a grand total of 3383.75 damage, but if he opens his fight with his q he can only do 2831.25, which is by no means 4000, and considering most champions reach 47%-50% armor without and bonus on average he can only do between (q first/aa first) 1500.5625/1798.6875 and 1415.625/1696.875 respectively, neither of which is anywhere close to 4k, so you my friend, have been proven.\n\n\n**TDLR: You were wrong.**\n\nOh and as a side note to before, he is damn easy to kite, provided you don't think running down a lane of minions helps you kite him. He cant do shit in the jungle, especially if the monsters are dead, nothing to stack q n and nothing to gap close with, dead in the water, figuratively, and literally if in the river.\n\nhttp://ind5.ccio.co/C2/pE/F2/ccb8dfbf8acc03a62cc8669c17a6e9c6.jpg?iw=300","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-11T09:37:20.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only ever ban Yasuo to keep him off the enemy, team, id pray to the gods to have one on my team for a change.\n\nYasuo's E isn't affected by slowing effects, it scales with his bonus movement speed, meaning if he is slowed, he get less of a bonus, but he isn't actually slowed like Kalista.\n\nBlow over Zed/Kat/Fizz/LB and Kha how? \nBecause I didn't compare Yasuo's damage to them? I don't need to?\nFizz does more damage than Yasuo does in a shorter amount of time, Kassadin does less. Yasuo is in the middle? He's still an assassin.\n\nYou can do the maths any way you want with varying amounts of AD and AS, the way I did it equaled 4000, the way you did it equalled slightly less (3300).\nEither way he does more than either Talon or Kassadin, so he DOES do assassin damage, even if built as a fighter.\nYou just proved that with your own maths.\n\nWhich in turn proves my argument right.\nSo my 4000 was off, congrats you proved me wrong, my point still remains that he does assassin level damage, and you just proved it.\nThanks i guess?\n\nYou say he is easy to kite, but then you say the word 'providing'. \nWell, theres plenty of champs that can be kited without the need for the word 'providing'. meaning that Yasuo is less easy to kite than them.\n\nSaying \"Yasuo is easy to kite if you remove his dash.\" Is exactly the same as saying \"Master Yi is easy to kite, providing he has no mana and his ult is down.\"\n\nJust like \"Fizz doesn't do any damage, 'providing' all his abilities are on cooldown.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, with his windwall and dash, Yasuo is generally one of the harder champions to kite.\n\nSure you can kite him if he is walking towards you with no minions around. But what self respecting Yasuo player would do that?\nThats like playing Azir, and running face first into the enemy front line. You just know not to do that.\n\nand i dont really see the point of your image at the end.\nThere is no opinions here. Just facts.\nShow me where I have an opinion that isn't supported by solid facts?\n\n______\n\nUltimately it comes down to this:\nCan Yasuo be classed as an assassin?\n\nYes or No?","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-11T12:57:49.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your opinion is he is over powered.

But Diana can be built more like a Bruiser if the need arises, (and it's good to have that flexibility)\n\nLeBlanc is really fun and plays more like Katarina and Ekko than many of the others, but she requires a fair bit of brainwork and strategy, so if you just want a champ to jump on the enemy and kill them, then maybe she isn't the one. But if you like bewildering the enemy and leaving them speechless, then go for it!\n\nKassadin is one my favourite assassins (probably even my no. 1 fave), and his one-shot potential is pretty huge late game, but unlike most of the ones you listed, he has very very clear moments of downtime, during which he cant do much, so I'm not sure if you'd like him or not, but I think he is great fun. (worth a try at least)\n\nAlthough, legit his entire laning phase is just praying you don't give the enemy toooo many kills before you reach lvl 6. \nSo it'll be a huge difference to Ekko/Zed/Yasuo who bully the crap out of all lane opponents.\n\nBut just for the love of god please don't play Fizz. Theres no need for that.\n\n______\n\nOverall based on what you play already, Id reccomend Akali the most, she has awesome playmaking potential with her R and invisibility, can 1-shot most things with relative ease, isn't too hard, plays very similarly to Kat and Zed, and above all is pretty fun.\n\nI hope this was useful :P","replies":[]}]}
