I just am an average 20yr old that works and play League with friends in my spare time. I have never wanted to hack, cheat, lie. Nothing.\r\nBut if i get banned for doing nothing. Then i might as well hack, cheat and lie and become master tier using cheats because playing correctly and fair gets you banned apparently! - i&#039;ve spent over $1000 AU on my one and only account.
