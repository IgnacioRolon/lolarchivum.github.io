I haven&#039;t decided on a name for this champ but now I&#039;ll go straight to the details.\nThis champion would be similar to Fiora in the fact that he/she is a master of swords and could possibly use fencing swords like Fiora. This champion duel wields swords and that&#039;s basically all I have for design XD.\n\nHere are this champions abilities:\nPassive- Swiftly/Swiftness\nNo attack speed limit\n\nBonus attack speed gives bonus movement speed\nBonus movement speed gives bonus attack speed\n\nAbilities scale with attack speed\nBasic attacks deal less damage by ?%\n\nMay only have 1 stance active at a time unless \"Final Dance\" changes this\n\nQ- Agressive stance(Toggled Passive)\nAttack Speed is reduced by ?%(Does not affect passive ratios)\nReduces the effect of basic attacks dealing less damage from passive by ?%\nBasic Attacks deal bonus (True/Physical/Magic) damage equal to ?% of attack speed(randomised damage output: 50% chance for Physical Damage, 35% chance for Magic damage and 15% chance for true damage. This can only occur three times every 5 seconds)\n\nW- Defensive/Reflective Stance(Toggled Passive)\nAttack Speed is reduced by ?%(Does not affect passive ratios)\nIf attacked from the front there is a 2.5%/5%/7.5%/10%/12.5% chance of of reflecting the attack back at the attacker(including abilities)\nIf attacked from the side there is a 2%/4%/6%/8%10% chance of of reflecting the attack back at the attacker(including abilities)\nIf attacked from behind there is 1.5%/3%/4.5%/6%/7.5% chance of of reflecting the attack back at the attacker(including abilities)\nIf the attack is not reflected back at the attacker you take reduced damage by 1%/2%/3%/4%/5%\n\nE- Utility Stance(Toggled Passive)Name undecided)\nAttack Speed is reduced by ?%(Does not affect passive ratios)\nAttacks will either Heal Self/Slow/Stun/Reduce Armour of the basic attacked enemy\nChances of each effect are 25%, randomised chance for which one will be proc'd/activated\nIf the stun is used then this ability will go on cooldown for 3 secs\n\nR- Final Dance(Passive)\nYou may activate 2 stances at once instead of just 1\nAttack Speed is increased by ?%\nMovement speed is increased by ?%\n(Possibly bonus stat improvements)\n\nThat's all I have for right now. Of course if some of the things listed above are too OP of course it could be changed or moved. I don't know how balanced this champion will be so of course some things will have to be changed. Tell me what you think about this champion concept.\n\nThanks\nmkaracon","replies":[{"poster":"BigLebowski","date":"2015-09-12T05:44:39.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"You may activate 2 stances at one instead of just 2\" ???","replies":[{"poster":"mkaracon","date":"2015-09-12T20:48:45.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oops typo, you may activate 2 stances at once instead of just 1","replies":[]}]}]}
