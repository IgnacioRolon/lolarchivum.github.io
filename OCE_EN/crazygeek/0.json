Sadly, I missed the live broadcast driving to visit family, but that&#039;s cool - that&#039;s what a VOD section is for, right?\r\n\r\n...right?\r\n\r\nAnd this doesn&#039;t seem to be unusual. The standard lolesports.com page seems to get their VODs up for all regions within a day, but OCE consistently lags behind to the tune of up to a week and a half. I&#039;d love to support my home region&#039;s esports scene, but stuff like this makes it annoyingly and needlessly difficult. \r\nWhat, are the VODs under contract to Foxtel or Village Cinemas or something?","replies":[{"poster":"WeirdyBeardy","date":"2017-04-07T01:14:41.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi CrazyGeek,\n\nJust to follow on from this - we finished reviewing how we publish VODs, as we do want to deliver the best quality in the most timely manner. From here on in, VODs will be up on Monday morning in 1080p 60fps for your viewing pleasure. We'll continue to make improvements to this to get quality VODs out as early as possible.\n\nThanks for taking the time to give feedback, and pls do let us know if there's anything else you'd like to see on Lolesports.com!\n\nWeirdyBeardy","replies":[]},{"poster":"belquin","date":"2017-03-29T23:31:02.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey CrazyGeek,\n\nYou are right - we were experimenting with some different quality settings for this week and it took a lot longer. We generally aim to get them up by the Monday morning on oce.lolesports.com, otherwise you can find them as soon as they go up on youtube.\n\nSorry for the delay.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out again if we are not holding to the standards we set ourselves because we do really appreciate the support of you and other people who are taking an active interest in our domestic Esports.\n\nThanks!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2017-03-29T13:28:31.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I usually do is watch the VODs on the official Twitch page:\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/opl/videos/all","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2017-03-29T11:06:48.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They were posted 3 days ago to youtube.
