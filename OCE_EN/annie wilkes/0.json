The queue times have gone from 2-minute wait to 1 minute and I have been put in support and adc 7/10 games. The queue time hasn&#039;t even been shortened it has been lengthened because people continue to dodge every champ select. I understand that autofill is good when the server population is low but permanent auto fill really..... might as well just give us the old champ select again.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-12-04T02:42:52.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once you've been Auto Filled once, or playing Support once your next three games you are guaranteed to get one of your picks.\n\nThere is no \"permanent\" auto-fill.\n\nHell I NEVER get auto-fill.","replies":[{"poster":"Annie Wilkes","date":"2016-12-04T05:26:43.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When making this post I was unaware of the auto fill protection, however, the champ select we had before the new one we got support about 10% of games this feels like we get it much more.

Usually, it's on for a day, then the notification goes away. It is permanent in that, after almost a week, the notification is still there.

A lot of players will also be going on holidays to the beach, where they can't play games.\n* We're also near the end of exam season (at least for NZ), where people are going to be studying instead of playing video games. \n* On top of this, its also preseason, where a good portion of your usual ranked players are playing norms and trying new stuff. \n\nAll of this lowers your player pool, causing matchmaking issues and resulting the the need of autofill. Especially since a lot of players are only \"mid/top\" players and hardly any of the community supports. \n\nA good thing to do is to perhaps alternate between picking support as your primary (filthy and unthinkable, I know), picking up a super cool champ and playing them as support (poppy and irelia are pretty good at this, so is annie). That way, you play 1 game as a support, then 1-3 games as one of your main roles. \n\nJust like Klavinmour, I have only been autofilled once during my \"hurr durr imma main top/adc and get out of this plat elo hell\" 2day spree where I then gave up because I realised I am not good at CS. During my support main times, never ever autofilled even before you were autofill protected by playing sup.

More time for gaming the better for them, even if they have school it comes second to the game or gaming.\n\nGamers who need escape will always take this game or others over finishing school work and will procrastinate until the end where they have to rush out their school work. I mean that's where the whole meme for it comes from, primarily from gamers or fanbois of certain things. \n\nAlso summer work? Wtf is that. Are you American or something? Because summer here isn't like over in America at all. Our summer break is pretty short so most likely they use it to game the most or some times rarely go to family things. Very rarely would  they use that time to go overseas or to vacation, Vacation to them is being lazy and getting in some quality gaming time, if they don't think this way you can for sure tell they aren't a gamer or as we call them, tourist gamers. The only time i think people would go on holidays/vacation else where from home is kids forced to go with their parents. Ask any gamer teen and they would tell you their ideal holiday is spending more time with the games they love and not feeling bad about it one bit.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-12-07T20:52:17.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Four games with me filling so far in ranked flex new season, got adc three times, and support once.
