It's usually a result of something conflicting with League in your specific setup, so it can be very difficult to nail down. At the very least it's usually your client, not *the* client, so if you were adamant that it wasn't on your end it is unsurprising that you never found a solution.\n\nTry to remember anything new on your PC since the issue has started again, if something lines up, that's probably the conflict.\n\nUpdate everything, no matter how unrelated it seems. Graphics drivers are the first thing to check for sure, but even if you have a dumb java update or something do that (or at least close it) as well.\n\nIf you have any overlays like Overwolf or even Discord overlay, disable them, and see if it fixes the issue.\n\nTry closing everything else while playing League, if it fixes the issue, then something there is conflicting.\n\nTry turning \"close client while in game\" on and see if that helps.\n\nTry disabling V-sync, since that can also sometimes cause fps issues.","replies":[{"poster":"ChriSKate","date":"2017-12-28T10:08:50.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, Chris from Overwolf here. \nOverwolf shouldn't cause any FPS drops and if it does we'd love to hear about it. We are all gamers here and this is extremely important to us.\n\nI would recommend to try and disable Overwolf / Discord overlay (one at a time) and see how it affects your FPS in game. If while running only Overwolf with the game you still experience FPS drops, you're more than welcome to contact our support team and we'll have a look!\n\nI recently came across this thread so it might be the case for you too: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/PIEAhqwc-fps-drop-fix?show=nested","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-12-28T12:27:40.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was mostly an example :P I've had issues with Overwolf gif highlights conflicting with geforce somewhere and causing issues, but it was more a general \"disable anything interfacing with league and see if it's fixed\" kinda thing. Overwolf was just what first came to mind.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
