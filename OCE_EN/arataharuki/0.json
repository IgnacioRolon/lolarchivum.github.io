Now i try my best to keep my cool in those games and save my salt for the post game reports, but ive reported so many people now that i cant quite come to terms with the fact i haven&#039;t gotten ONE report card back saying someone had been punished. It cant possibly be that every reportable person ive come across has been a first time offender and was just \"having a bad game\". \r\n\r\nAll of this radio silence is really quite disheartening tbh, i would think after all that grief and frustration, id get **some** justice and peace of mind. So whats the go? Are player report cards still in the workshop and becoming active soon&trade;? What exactly is going on with the tribunal right now, where is it at and when can we expect a polished tribunal? (if i get a \"soon&trade;\" response i might just flip a table)\r\n\r\ni read in another thread here  http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/Q2HLQ31e-the-new-report-system-is-an-absolute-laugh-gj-guys?comment=000200020000 that Maraudaur said:\r\n> We are going to be bring player voting back soon&trade;\r\n\r\nDoes this mean we&#039;re expecting a tribunal report system similar to the old case by case system?\r\n\r\nAnother small question i have is about the player report feedback cards themselves. I saw a [preview](http://apollo-na-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1438866670/c391e749b2369dd18679a4e743137dae.png) of what they look like and to me that just looks like a generic \"someone was punished but we wont tell you who, when, why or what the punishment was... just that something happened\". To me that kind of \"feedback\" is **VERY** lacklustre and imo, the satisfaction of knowing the who&#039;s what&#039;s and why&#039;s of the punishment are half the motivation to bother with the report in the first case! To me if that&#039;s what the player report card notification is then... well it&#039;s almost not worth the effort of filing a report to begin with.\r\n\r\nAny Riot staff who could answer some of this would be hella sweet thanks {{champion:119}}","replies":[]}
