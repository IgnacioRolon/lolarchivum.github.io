Having this new and improved player reform system, there should be less and less of these AFK&#039;s (and somewhat less DC&#039;s). I&#039;ve got to admit however that a pretty decent number of my games have had at least one AFK/DC, which just overall takes away from the fun of the game when suddenly you find yourself and three others trying to work extra hard to make up for your missing player.\r\n\r\nWith the new system culling out all the leavers it see&#039;s, the issue of leavers appearing in games is still present. While the system may reduce to some extent the amount of leavers in games, it in no way means that there will outright be no more leavers at all. Personally i think there is an element missing from this whole process. One solution i could think of is having a system that you can opt into from the matchmaking menu that basically says *&quot;yes i am okay with being placed in a game in session&quot;* which will essentially let you take the place of a leaver (and announce that to everyone in game).\r\n\r\nI know that system wouldn&#039;t be perfect but i really think this is an issue that is at least worth discussing, because currently there isn&#039;t really much being done at all for those games that *currently* have a leaver on their team.

Aside from that though, it would certainly be more of a \"for the players\" initiative, and with all the plans Riot has right now in terms of pre-season wrap up and harrowing and Worlds... its probably not going to be something Riot will look at in the near future. BUT, hopefully someone will at least see this post to plant the thought in their head and hopefully bring it up with other rioters.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-09-28T12:16:44.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"inb4 no reply from staff","replies":[{"poster":"ArataHaruki","date":"2015-10-01T03:47:47.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sadly i dont think they've seen it, maybe if i keep posting and keeping the thread alive theyll notice it aha","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2015-09-28T15:26:58.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good idea!","replies":[]}]}
