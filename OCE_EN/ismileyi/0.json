Like an emblem. I can&#039;t find anything decent so if anyone has any ideas or can find some good tattoo idea would appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThanks :P","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-10-16T05:28:16.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is the symbol he creates from magic with his taunt:\nhttps://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3XEwMZG703k/V3LogIODtbI/AAAAAAAAQ-c/lkZt-VJDgi8I6OO7cxQqj7Hdh23S_UexgCLcB/s1600/ryze0taunt.jpg\n\nBut what i think would be better, would be a ring around the arm made from the runes that make up his Q, some of which can be seen on the left under the scroll here:\nhttp://cdn.garenanow.com/webupdate/live/lolphweb/news/2015%20June/29/Ryze/590.JPG\nand in-game here:\nhttps://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VBuVqNpcA_1Mp0LtwnWUEDMFNmQ=/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6720919/image.jpg\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/9nmNqWQonBI/maxresdefault.jpg\n\nBy arm ring tattoo i mean this kind of thing:\nhttp://www.oocities.org/~fishjuggler/MattTattoo.JPG\n\nFirstly though id think _\"in 20 years will i even remember who the fuck Ryze is?\"_ and if the answer is \"_Yes and i love him to pieces!\"_ then go ahead haha \n\nBut i think an arm ring of his runes, or maybe a line of runes down the back of the leg or middle of the back. would look cool. \n\n**SINGLE COLOUR THOUGH! **\nblack or dark blue. tattoos that use multiple colours often start looking naf (In my opinion of course) \n\nthe designer in me is coming out now...\n\n[EDIT]: His E is even already runes in the shape of a ring, just have that exactly, around your arm or something (my opinion)","replies":[]}]}
