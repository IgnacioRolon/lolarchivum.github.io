In the [match history](http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/137145333/200688457) you can see my first death, it&#039;s when the lags started. Two minutes after my second death is when lags ended. During the whole time I could connect to the rest of the internet (Google, Steam, etc.) and my teammates were not affected by the lags.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-06-17T23:51:52.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nHave you experienced this issue since?\n\nFrom your description it sounds like this was a problem on your or your ISP's end of things.","replies":[]}]}
