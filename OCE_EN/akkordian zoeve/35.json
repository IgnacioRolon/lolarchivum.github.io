If yes then no doubt your friend has better mmr which boosted your average mmr between the both of you. For example (this did happen to me lol in a good way i suppose) I was smurfing with like my silver 3 account which had mmr of a gold and my friend was in gold at that time with really good mmr (forgot which elo). When we duo-ed despite our elos we managed to queue up against plats-low diamonds. So its possible that if you did duo then you were just sitting on their mmr <- not saying it in a negative way ;-; I feel like it sounds negative when u say it. But earning 13 lp is definitely an indication that your mmr has dropped a  lot lower than the average as in demotion if close to 0 lp or on a losing streak.\nGood luck buddy I believe in you!","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-04-20T00:17:34.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks :)\n\nI was just looking at my OP.GG because I won another game and only got 12 LP this time.\nDoes it have something to do with the fact everyone in my game in B5 but I'm B4???","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-04-20T00:55:14.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a safe bet. Once matchmaking raises your MMR, you'll find yourself against more formidable opponents and also gain more LP with your victories and lose less LP in your losses. \n\nYou can read more on the Matchmaking Guide:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
