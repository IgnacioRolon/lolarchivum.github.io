I know she was release with others, but on that particular date, they were listed alphabetically.\n\nThanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-09-17T12:13:58.162+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh my god, you actually did it...\n\nWill definitely have to give this a read tomorrow, when I'm not so tired.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-09-17T19:50:31.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Gasp*\nWere you doubting me the whole time? :P","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-09-18T00:24:17.648+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A little bit, yes.\n\nI was under the impression that you were just getting a feel for how far Riot was willing to let the whole \"choice of medium\" thing go.\n\nI'm glad you went through with it, though.
