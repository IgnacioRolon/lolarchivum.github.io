All that it depends on is the champion. If you pick Soraka, this quest encourages you to ult whenever it is off cooldown, and not when it would be best for your team (actual skill). What about Evelynn with the ridiculously long cooldown on her ult? Are you going to use that to clear minions as soon as it is up to quickly complete the quest, or wait a bit to use for a tactical/mechanical advantage (ie securing Baron)?\n\nThe point is when you start comparing this to transformation, stacking, and other champions, such as Nidalee, Teemo, Anivia, Jayce, Kassadin, Elise, etc. who have *very low* cooldowns on their &quot;ultimate&quot;. They can just abuse this by just generally transforming or stacking throughout the game (which does not take skill). Anivia could just toggle her ult on and off every few seconds. Kassadin could buy CDR and just spam ult in the fountain for a minute and complete that part of the quest, and then return to the game almost right where he left it. At least with Teemo, you can apply skill by placing your low cooldown shrooms in tactical places.\n\nAnd this is not even getting to Udyr...\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt would be nice if Riot actually put thought into the missions, because it sounds like a really amazing concept if done right...\n\n{{sticker:sg-lulu}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-10-25T04:14:17.066+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would rather these missions then the 5 man premade ones, please don't ever bring those back Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-10-25T04:15:29.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, gosh...
