Same with Kayle. And Jayce switches between a Ranged and a Melee form.\n\nWhat about other champions? Every few seconds, Poppy has a Ranged auto-attack.

She isn't natively ranged which is why she isn't classed that way.\n\nAlso Poppy isn't ranged, she's melee, same deal as Kayle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-10-07T07:40:45.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow...
