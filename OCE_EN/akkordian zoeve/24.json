I know that a Prisoner&#039;s Island would make things worse, and I understand the reason why Riot are against it. Since you&#039;ve recently taken inspiration from *Overwatch* for the new Honour&#039;s System, I have a suggestion...\n\n**The Idea**\nThere is a game called *Mobile Legends* which is literally a rip-off from LoL (but that&#039;s not the point). In this game, they have a ranked &quot;health&quot; bar, which maxes at 100. Every time you go AFK or int or troll or are toxic you lose a certain amount of that health. Once you go below 70, ranked becomes disabled until you get it back up above 70, which you can do by playing games with good behaviour (which give you 1 health, I believe). You don&#039;t need to win those games; just show you are no longer a toxic player. It also puts people who have had a high decrease for several games in a lower priority queue.\n\nOn the opposite end, anyone with higher than 90 or 95 at the end of a given week gets a reward (the equivalent to a Hextech Chest + Key). This gives players an incentive to have good behaviour.\n\n**The Suggestion**\nIf you can somehow integrate a system this like into LoL, it will prevent well behaved players who are trying their best from being matched with trolls and feeders.\n\nEven if this can be merged with the new Honour&#039;s System (i.e. anyone with Honour Level 1 cannot played Ranked - since the default is Level 2), it would drastically improve game health.\n\n**TL;DR**\nCopy *Mobile Legends* health system, which decreases health whenever someone has bad behaviour, and below a certain health value Ranked becomes disabled for them, and perhaps even integrate this into the new Honour&#039;s System.\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-06-13T11:04:19.128+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Brilliant idea, I say YES!","replies":[]},{"poster":"BananaSlayerAMO","date":"2017-06-13T05:27:24.514+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's good about this is how people face very clear and direct consequences, but they still have chances to play rather than a straight ban.\n\nWhat I'm curious about is how normal games will be affected if all the toxic people are moved there.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-06-13T10:08:39.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> What I'm curious about is how normal games will be affected if all the toxic people are moved there.\n\nI don't imagine the trolls of ranked would be too much of an issue in that respect. Their main focus is (likely) ranked, so they'd likely only be using normals to \"raise their health\" (and thus, not causing any real trouble). That said, there could be a lower threshold applied to normals (as per the above example, \"50 health\") which will then restrict players to coop should they drop below that threshold as well. You could even go one step further and drop players to lesser difficulties of coop should they continue to fall (this would make it even easier to find intentional feeders, as they'd stick out like a Donald Trump in intro bots).\n\nOverall it seems like a good idea to help deal with the toxicity of ranked (and maybe even normals), and can even be considered superior to bans (whether temporary or permanent).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2017-06-11T12:42:43.473+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Failing my real life verification idea this would be a close second to fixing ranked health.\n\nAnything that physically removes trolls from the queue is far better than telling them they shouldnt do it.","replies":[]}]}
