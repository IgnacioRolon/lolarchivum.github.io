How many Eve OTPs are actually on the PBE? Sure, there may be people who play her every now and then, but they aren&#039;t OTPs. Imagine how useful an OTP would be for reviewing the champion. \r\n\r\nThis also isn&#039;t a *completely* selfish request. I do also have a YT and Twitch channel, and I can&#039;t really find many other Eve OTP channels out there. I would be recording and reviewing everything from an OTPs PoV (which would be really helpful), and it would also be on r/evelynnmains, so they can dissect it as well. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m not sure how many PBE requests you get like this, but please could you consider this?\r\n\r\nAlso, if this isn&#039;t the best way to make contact with Riot with regards to this, what would be?\r\n\r\nMany thanks and hope,\r\nLittle Witch Eve\r\n\r\n&lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Sped","date":"2017-09-26T05:31:16.269+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If only Riot looked at these, PBE wont ever be realised to OCE, its intentions were to let the American's get everything first, like every OCE players says, we get everything last :)","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-09-26T05:39:41.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've heard that as well :( Bit of a shame :(\n\nWell, we did get Honours and something else first :)\n\nI'm also pretty sure there are OCE players with PBE accounts; there's a guy [Smurtehmurph] who posts videos on the Boards who has a PBE account.","replies":[{"poster":"Sped","date":"2017-09-26T08:17:43.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What he's done, he's ranked up an account on NA to level 30 and probs plays on it constantly to do that.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sonatics77","date":"2017-10-16T22:32:45.764+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot is giving away PBE accounts.
