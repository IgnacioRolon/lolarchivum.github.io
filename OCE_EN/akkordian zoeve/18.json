Eve had a rework that removed invisibility and a stun on her first attack whenever she left invisibility (true invisibility and not camouflage), and everyone complained about that. I still loved her even after that, grew to enjoy the new kit (except the lack luster ult), and now here we have a potential fix. \n\nIt just means you'll have to alter your play style a bit, but then you should be amazing!!!!\n\n❤ ❤ ❤\n\n#(Hashtag) RevertAzirForSesh","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-09-26T05:01:14.807+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"<3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-09-24T03:57:29.110+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"do say though, that blink attack looks fun","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-09-24T04:13:10.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know, right ❤ ❤ ❤ \n\nI'm guessing that's her new ultimate :)\n\nThat *finally* means her ult is a killing ability (like other assassins), and not a % *current* health AoE slow :D","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-09-25T17:32:43.662+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i was thinking it looked ultish, her hate spikes look more defined and powerful too.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-09-25T18:30:00.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They sure do :D\n\nExcept that they clearly have an animation, so no more Qing while auto-ing or running :(","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-09-26T04:46:45.911+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe the animation is only when she is standing still, or its like the new yas skin when he has homeguard where he flicks his hands as he runs, but instead of spikes out of his arms, they come out of their target.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-09-24T00:52:24.739+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You seriously have an issue with Evelyn, like calm the fuck down jesus.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-09-24T01:02:37.408+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"❤ ❤ ❤\n\nShe's the only reason I play League now.
