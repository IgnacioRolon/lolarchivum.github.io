It has nothing to do with everyone playing on bricks; it stays at 0% for about a minute, and them boom! we&#039;re suddenly in game. It doesn&#039;t rise, or anything. It just stays at 0%.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s nothing game-breaking, though. Just thought you may want a heads up.\r\n\r\nThanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"UniqueTorch","date":"2017-08-07T07:58:39.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I need help.. it just says 0% .. and once everyone is loaded it rises. and sometimes it just goes directly into the game. i need help with this","replies":[]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-04-11T05:28:33.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nIve noticed this occasionally also, I normally experience this when I alt tab from the game during loading.\n\nDoes this occur in every single game you connect to?","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-04-11T09:15:37.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, every single game.
