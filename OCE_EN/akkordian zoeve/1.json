One of these was that Eve makes a little sound when detected by an enemy which can be used to detect invisible or hidden enemies (like Shaco's Q, or someone in an unwarded brush). The tip linked to a YT video which shows how to manipulate the game&#039;s sound files so this becomes a very obvious sound (i.e. a siren instead of a nearly inaudible &quot;whoosh&quot;).\n\nJust wondering if this [changing the sound files] is against Riot rules, and if it could get you banned?\n\nThanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-04-29T05:13:34.616+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Changing the sound is bannable, but increasing the sounds volume isn't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2017-04-29T07:21:11.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you dont preach to chat that youre using different sound files then you wont get banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-04-29T08:54:23.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is doubtful. Riot has systems in place that will detect modifications to the client, such as changing a sound file. So even without mentioning the changes to anyone, it would more than likely still result in a ban. It even happens with people who just change splash arts in the client itself, which falls under \"use at your own risk\" (rather than explicitly banned), so something like changing the audio files of the game itself would *definitely* trigger the system.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-29T02:52:55.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does because it provides an unfair advantage in the game.\n\nTF q makes a sound when it hits, but its so subtle people don't notice it unless they have ludens, if you change that to a loud bang when it hits, he would be able to check every brush no problem and have massive advantage over normal","replies":[{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2017-04-29T07:07:28.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tfw you disable sound to save fps","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-04-29T03:01:03.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought as much.
