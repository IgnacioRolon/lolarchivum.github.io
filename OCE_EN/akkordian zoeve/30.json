But for no reason, after my 10th win, instead of earning 20+ LP per win, it dropped to 10 LP. And with losses, it increased from 10 to 20+.\r\n\r\nI didn&#039;t have a huge loss streak in between. It was 90% wins over 15 or 16 games. According to OP.GG my MMR was really high for my rank, and then after that 10th win, it dropped to really low for no reason.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t duo with anyone, so it&#039;s not that.\r\n\r\nIf it weren&#039;t for this weird thing, I would easily be in B3 or B2 now. But no! Is there a bug breaking my MMR???","replies":[]}
