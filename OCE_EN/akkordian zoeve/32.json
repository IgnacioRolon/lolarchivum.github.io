Unfortunately I don't get Eve every time, but an Eve URF video will be coming soon :D Thanks for watching xD My stream: https://mixer.com/CynderIsAwkward Twitter: @cynderisawkward Music: 「Nightcore」DESPACITO - Marimo","url":"https://youtu.be/vcZtvvhGJec","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vcZtvvhGJec/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hiya :)\r\n\r\nI am very proud of the moment at 1:48 in the video, and think that&#039;s the best part. I know the music isn&#039;t to everyone&#039;s taste, but my main concern was attempting to sync the gameplay with the beats in the song. Naturally, the fast pacing of Despacito suited an URF video xD\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think... any and all advice would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-08-16T02:20:11.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hears music..... closes browser...","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-08-16T07:28:38.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nightcore - no\nAnime music - no\nElectro/techy music - no\nSelena Gomez - no\nDisney music - no\nFast-paced music in a different language which suits URF - no\n\nWell what music can I use, then? Every single video I try a different kind of music, and every time there is nothing but complaints about the music. No one ever complains about the content because they just close the video after a few seconds :(\n\nMy next video is going to have something from the *League of Legends* OST. Surely that would be acceptable?\n\nWhat else can I do?","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-08-17T01:12:52.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just use we are number one","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-08-17T02:12:07.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, will do :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
