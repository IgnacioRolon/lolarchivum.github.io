Sometimes, my games are okayish. Most of the time, though, I&#039;m the sole reason my team loses, not because I&#039;m intentionally feeding, but because I&#039;m just straight up garbage.\n\nTake my most recent Katarina game. I went something like 2/11. I was being flamed at and repeatedly told to kill myself. I don&#039;t have many games on her (don&#039;t have many games, if any, on all but one of the other champions either), but **I was trying my best**. I even split push and got 4 towers for our team. Inevitably, I was the reason we lost (very fed Syndra and Yi) and my team spammed saying they would report me.\n\nHow does the system differentiate between whether a player intentionally feeds, has a bad game, or (in my case) is utter garbage and can&#039;t play to save their life??? This isn&#039;t just a &quot;one-off&quot;. I&#039;m garbage *ALL THE TIME* except for maybe 20% of my Evelynn games.\n\nI try my best *every single game* and am focusing on improving just like all the YouTube guides say (my average cs has increased from an average of 20 per game to about 150 in just the past few months), but I&#039;m not getting anywhere...","replies":[{"poster":"Husy15","date":"2017-06-05T03:13:44.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For starters, most people wont report you for \"intentionally feeding\" unless you legitimately intentionally feed (even if they say they are going to.)\n\nSecondly, before taking a champion into ranked, its suggested to first play that champion in a normal game (i tend to do 5 normal games where i win lane, 5 normal games where i lose lane, before i take the champion to ranked). \n\nFrom the stats i saw, you need to very much focus on surviving after you've died a few times. Most players can do well if they get fed/win lane, but once they lose, they die constantly.  Learn how to LOSE a lane, but not feed/be too far behind of the rest of the game. your CS shouldnt be based on the number, but rather the Number per minute. having 150 cs is fine, but if you're at 40 minutes, you should have atleast double that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-06-05T02:30:58.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im sure if you're consistently \"garbage\" you will have no issues with the banning system. Unless you retaliate to the people calling you trash or saying kys. \n\nOn a side note make sure you report people that abuse you aftet the game.
