However, whenever Nidalee changed into cougar form, the icon reverted back to the classic portrait (and not the skin one).\r\n\r\nThanks, and hope this helps :D","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-07-29T03:46:57.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThis would be better suited for the [PBE Bugs](https://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bugs) board, before posting please be sure to read the [[HOW-TO] Report Bugs on the PBE](https://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bugs/CF5EEDC8FF5AC1A896F517E2C7AE4650C472807F-how-to-report-bugs-on-the-pbe) thread.","replies":[]}]}
