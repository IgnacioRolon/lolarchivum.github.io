LOADS of people hate it. It's because of this rubbish system that I keep getting placed in ADC. If I wanted to play ADC, I would have selected it as my primary or secondary. Even when I play my best, I still have a 0% win-rate as ADC. Then it doesn't help that no-one in the teams wants to swap anyway, so it's either lose 3 LP, get a 5 min ban, get auto-filled again and lose 3 more LP, or waste 20-30 minutes playing a role you hate. I have gotten so close to promos, then BOOM! auto-filled to ADC and lose LP.\r\n\r\nI don't care if I have to wait another 10 mins to get my role, just as long as I get it. I understand it's \"to make queues shorter\" but my queue times were about 2-3 minutes BEFORE auto-fill. Now it's 6.\r\n\r\nEven if there was a setting where you can turn off a particular role, I'd be happy.","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2017-04-10T07:52:09.600+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regarding the whole \"turn off\" a role thing, I remember that a Position Preference system was tested but unfortunately didn't work out because a lot of people were, _surprise surprise_, blocking support (which is really a large reason why the autofill system was introduced in the first place, to get people to play support). \n\nThis here is a quote from the [6.23 patch notes](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-623-notes#patch-position-preference) about it.\n\n>We have concluded testing position exclusion in LAN and LAS and saw it was negatively impacting queue times, so will not be continuing development on this feature. Weâ€™re continuing to experiment with improvements to the whole champion select process.\n\nOutside of Riot changing their minds, best thing you can do is try pick up at least one champ in every role. You don't have to be the best at it but just prepared enough for the occasion when you are forced to play it. \n\nHonestly, I started out **hating** ADC but after trying a number of them I realised that Ezreal was the one for me, poking from afar and jumping to the frustration of my opponents. Same thing happened with Jungle and Zac. Doesn't mean I win with them all the time but at least I'm guaranteed a passable time regardless of the role I am given.\n\nEven if nothing comes of it, even the quickest glance into the mechanics and playstyles of other roles and champions allows you to improve your overall skills when playing with and against them. As they say, knowing is half the battle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-04-10T03:55:08.412+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't even bother complaining anymore, I tried but the majority of the people on here don't understand some people only like playing 1 or 2 roles and give 0 f#cks about queue times.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-10T09:40:36.393+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The trouble is, that if you give the option to block roles or to simply wait until you get yours to some people, then you have to give it to everyone, so then you everyone doing that because who really wants to be autofilled, which essentially amounts to turning autofill off which results in hour long queue times for everyone anyway, and also pretty much guarantees that anyone that doesn't block roles and sticks to the two role pref is going to be autofilled, which encourages people not to play with the possibility of autofill which also results in hour long queue times for everyone anyway. So you can see the problem.\n\nIt's not something solved as easily as just giving people a choice, because either option destroys both player experience and ultimately player choice in a worse way than the current system does.\n\nI think improvements are the way to go, for example, they could look into the possibility of only pairing an autofilled ADC with a support main (i.e first role) and visa versa, though likely the support pop isn't big enough. \n\nThey can look at better rewards for filling/being filled (which they already are, but it has to be something that isn't abuseable, e.g just giving extra LP doesn't work cause I'm a support main so I can just fill, be pretty much guaranteed my main role AND get extra LP for doing nothing at all). \n\nThey could look at extra protections for those who get autofilled often, e.g instead of a few games after each fill/supp they could make it so you cannot be autofilled in more than x% of your games, which would protect those who main top/mid and play a lot of games.\n\nThe big one is obviously incentivising the support role more, but it's a difficult one. You need a completely different mindset to play support than you do to play any other roles (with the exception of support style junglers) and preserving that is important, because without it support would just be kill lanes. If they give rewards to people who don't normally play support, then where is the recognition for the support mains, but if they give recognition to the support mains for just doing what they already do have they really earned a reward?\n\nI think the new support items like Redemption definitely help, if you can maintain the support culture among those who main it, but also make it more interesting to attract those who don't with something unique (or at least make it so it's not a chore) then that's a good start as far as I'm concerned.\n\nUltimately we will always have to be able to play multiple roles, and even if you're a casual player it will improve your overall skill quite a bit anyway, but certainly there are options to explore in reducing the pain autofill causes. For now though, it's a necessary evil. The system we have is still miles better than what we had before, so it's pretty safe to say that Riot is moving in the right direction.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2017-04-10T04:19:15.006+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"another day another person complaining about autofill, i just dont understand it, i've been auto filled to support like 4 times and won every game its easy","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-04-10T04:26:32.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't mind Support (I actually enjoy it).
