Or will they be available for all players?\r\n\r\nThanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-10-19T22:50:25.022+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is some more info from our latest [ask riot](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/10/ask-riot-preseason-edition-volume-2/)\n\n\"There will also be a new kind of page. Everyone will have five “preset” pages, one for each Path, that are uneditable and don’t count toward your inventory total.

A level 1 account has access to all 8 runes, but as you level you'll be able to change them?\n\nWhy not just get rid of the leveling system since there are no longer 30 mastery points / rune slots and 8 doesn't go into 30 evenly?\n\nSo a new player gets 8 preset, unchangeable runes, is that what we're talking about here? What if I'm on an ADC or if I'm on a Tank, surely they don't use the same runes.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-10-16T21:39:47.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nYou might find this useful - http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/preseason-update#runes\n\nIf you see the create your playstyle section you will see there are 5 paths to go down. Each path has 3 key stones and also a bunch of other runes. I assume how it will work is at level 1 you will have access to a couple of different default paths (maybe even one each) then as you level you will unlock more keystones and runes which will open up more customization as you learn the game and develop your own style. Hope that clears it up a bit.","replies":[{"poster":"Bagboy Brown AI","date":"2017-10-17T05:44:02.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So Lv 30 players still have a blatant advantage over Lv 1 players. I'm not saying that Lv 30 players won't have more knowledge of the game, champions, skins etc. But putting certain runes behind a level wall because \"players aren't good enough to use them\" doesn't seem like a very good model to me.\n\nNew players will most likely lose to veteran players regardless of runes so why not put everyone on the same field, all I'm saying. Getting dumped on because you're new is one thing, but losing because other players have access to better rune choices is highly discouraging.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-10-17T01:51:10.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  assume\n\nCan we confirm this?","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-10-17T02:23:57.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't been able to find anything to confirm that but here is what I can confirm. \n\n[\"We’ve also seen a few questions about the new player experience.
