My Jungler and I absolutely face-rolled the enemy, but I dismissed it as a fluke, though, because of an insanely good adc.\n\nHowever, I have played this strategy *5 times now* and have yet to lose. And these were games with feeding ADCs and enemy Junglers that either counter Eve (like Lee Sin or Kha&#039; Zix) or are very strong vs invades (like Rengar). All of these games put the enemy Jugnler so far behind that they couldn&#039;t do anything.\n\nI just thought I might share this with you, because once may have been a fluke, but 5 games *where I carried* seems like something that could be a legitimate strategy (or a cheese). It&#039;s not like I put my own Jungler behind, because we both ended up far ahead in gold, xp, kills, and cs, plus had superior dragon/baron control, and amazing duo ganks.\n\nThanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-09-15T11:53:49.327+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"feedings adcs, haha not sure why that might be happening. Legit though, there was a singed who did this type of thing in plat who got banned for this with his 'dbl jungle singed support'.\n\nAlso if climbing is your thing, there is no greater cheese right now than support Janna with ardent censer (actually maybe the kogmaw+lulu 1 item unapproachable machinegun is pretty cheesy too). Bloody 70% winrate with minimal skill or game knowledge requirements.\n\nardent censer needs a nerf, and don't give me the, you're just complaining now that supports are good, because it screws tank and mage supports (the more interesting playmaking supports to play). \n\nThe ardent rush has also skewed things in botlane to a pick coin, rush ardent and stay in lane meta. I used to roam, invade, contest jungle vision, sometimes even try to towerdive the midlaner earlygame as janna/zilean/alistair/naut. Now I just sit in lane playing janna passively, trying to bully the enemy support out of coins, and rely on gold per second runes to win me the lane once I back and buy my first and only really needed item, the ardent censer.\n\n... this got tangential didn't it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-09-18T03:42:38.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure we've had this discussion before. I don't know about legitimate but I don't think it's a good strategy. There's a whole bunch of different ways to counter it. It just depends on how smart your opposition is. Most likely I would say it's currently working cause your in bronze and people aren't correctly adapting to what your doing. \n\nYour giving up a lot by having a second jungle instead of a support and even more because Eve has no hard cc or other utility","replies":[]},{"poster":"Low APM High WPM","date":"2017-09-18T02:57:30.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Youll legitimately have to be in bronze 5 for that to work lol....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-09-15T13:47:48.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm curious how the adc on your team reacted to this every time you tried it because if I was in their position I would be reporting you straight up. I don't care if you've been lucky a few games in a row don't be a hard-ass about being autofilled support. I don't like it either but it's one of those things you have to suck it up and deal with it. Like Nightjar said just play janna and build ardent censor boom easy game. But I guess that doesn't matter because you're a stupid stubborn one-trick that thinks you can get away playing League with only Evelyn. \n\nUnfortunately the days of one-tricking are over, unless you're a challenger Zed/Yasuo one-trick you are barely gonna climb. Listen to proper advice on how to get out of bronze and learn 2-3 champions in every role. If you really care about \"X champion is the only champion for me blah blah blah I only have fun in League if I play this single champion blah blah blah\" then that's fine. Just don't expect to be anywhere out of bronze. If you care about having fun with your little special champion then go ahead and have fun in bronze league with all the braindead retards. \n\nThe only way you're gonna climb is if you play smart, and part of playing smart is having a reasonably sized champion pool and a very flexible amount of picks which can help in counter picking against the enemy team. It also helps in having a proficient amount of champions that are good in each respective lanes. For example in your case, you just wanna play Evelyn Top, Jungle, Mid etc. But in reality Evelyn is good in the jg and that's it. You wanna have champions such as Malphite/Darius for Top, Talon/Ahri for Mid, then Eve/Lee sin for Jg.\n\nLike Nightjar also said, there was a singed in high elo that attempted what you're currently trying to do, and he got banned because even if he liked what he was doing and liked the idea, \"his teammates didn't like the idea of what he was doing\". Which lead to him being classified as a troll for abandoning his adc and leaving them to 2v1 which usually resulted in botlane being lost. But it was fine in his eyes because he was giving top and mid a lead, but imagine if you were the adc in the situation, yeah I wouldn't want to be that guy either. If adc has to suffer because support wants to try something wacky that ruins the lane for the adc then its trolling in my eyes. Just follow the damn META, which I'll remind you stands for MOST EFFICIENT Tactical Advancement. As in, this is the MOST EFFICIENT way of winning the game. Seriously just follow it, its not hard.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-09-15T19:38:04.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. It's not like I'm inting or trolling (maybe the first time I tried the strategy, but not now). I'm still playing to win (which, with a 100% win-rate, I am). \n\n2. */mute all* works wonders. \n\n3. Meta isn't actually an acronym. There are quite a few people who think it's an acronym, but it's not. Meta is it's own word. \n\n4. I've tries Ardent Janna, and went 0/20. That's very different to the 15/1 I get with Eve Support. \n\n5. The Support Singed wasn't banned because of his strategy (because they were playing to win and actually winning), but rather because of a lack of communication and being *very* toxic. \n\n6. Lane Eve works (but I'm not good at it). It's harder than an actual mid laner, but if you put in the time and the effort then it will work well. And I'm not just saying it. There a plenty of Plat/Diamond Evelynn Mid/Top/Support players, although when I say Support, they build Coin and Sightstone, and not Smite, etc.","replies":[]}]}]}
