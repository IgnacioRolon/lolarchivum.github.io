Riot its called 'Ghost' so why can't you ignore unit collision while its activated.\n\nCan it not? I remember it could\n\nI would say Flash for 2 main reasons\n\nThe first is that, Flash is a blink, so it can be used to go over walls, 'hop' over Veigar's stun or Thresh Box and Azir Wall, things that otherwise you can't avoid with Ghost.\n\nSecond, is that Ghost is more for sustained damage dealers like 'old' Darius. 'Old' Darius would use ghost relatively more to now since he would stick to a certain target, drop their HP bar and then execute, but with Flash, Flash is more burst, like you've nearly exhausted your damage and you Flash in for the instant kill. Plus its a gal closer/gap maker which is instantaneous. I just played a game as Kassadin where Flash saved my life. I was versing a (very bad) LeBlanc who tried to combo me. We ended up both low and about to die. I fell for LB's clone as I ult'd the clone when the real LB chained me. If I did nothing, Ignite and her 2nd part of her chains would've killed me, however I flashed right in front of her face, killing her with W and leveling up enough to survive Ignite. If I had taken Ghost, I would've been stopped in my tracks and died anyway.\n\nBasically Flash is instantaneous and in League, time is everything\n\n{{champion:38}}","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-11-25T09:46:19.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I'm all for flash but some champions just work better with ghost (Hecarim for the bonus damage and he already has a flash like ability) or singed for his extra speed these are just 2 examples there are a couple more but this two I know for certain.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-11-25T11:04:59.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/clashofclans/images/c/ce/Why_not_both%3F.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130824200436","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-11-25T11:16:07.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could the bot vlad does all the time(if intermediate)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-11-25T06:56:26.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"depends on who you play.","replies":[]}]}
