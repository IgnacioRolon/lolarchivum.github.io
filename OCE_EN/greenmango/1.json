If you are gone for a certain amount of time and detected as a leaver then you'll get penalized. The only way to reduce your Leaver status is to play games without leaving them. Once you've played enough you'll get a message saying your Leaver status has diminished; beyond that, you'll simply have to work off your Leaver penalty.\n\nJust because your disconnection was unintentional doesn't mean it was less harmful to the game and a problem to the other players. If you have a recurring problem with your PC or connection, please do your best to see that the problems are fixed before queueing up for a matchmade game. (there are support articles if you need to troubleshoot a problem)\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ\n---\nPosting this thread in multiple places won't increase your chances of Riot removing your penalty. Don't leave games and you won't get Leaver Buster penalties. If your laptop is prone to overheating then you need to fix it.","replies":[]}]}
