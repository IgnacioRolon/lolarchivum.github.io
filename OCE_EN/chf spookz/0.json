Below Ill give you guys some Info about me and my interests.\r\n\r\nI am a 22 year old University student currently completing my Honours in Biomechanics as well as sessional teaching at university which just involves me taking a tutorial of 20 students. I have played soccer at a semi-professional level my whole life until injuries really set me back from taking the next step which converted me into gaming. Other hobbies I have include watching VIKINGSSSSSSSSSS, Coffees with the boys and clubbing but now ive settled down and tend to have more nights in than nights out.\r\n\r\nI never really played many video games due to my training regime but due to being sidelined with injuries I began to play FIFA on Playstation (inb4 Playstation gamer idiot). I then ventured off into bigger and better things such as League of Legends, I started playing Late season 2 and never looked back. I still play soccer at an amateur level just to maintain some kind of fitness and hope one day to get back into the swing of things and see where it can take me, but for now I am content with how League is going and looking to make it internationally with SIN.\r\n\r\nI have hovered Diamond, Master and Challenger ranking my whole career as Ive never had the correct attitude to remain consistently high elo. Im working on fixing that and becoming the best jungler I can be. I have a lot of competitive experience which involved me being a sub on Legacy for a long time in my early days but now I am the captain and jungler for SIN GAMING (FIGHTO).\r\n\r\nI also stream league of legends over @ twitch.tv/notjuves, you will probably find me streaming throughout this AMA so dont be shy to pop by and say hi but please keep your questions for here.","replies":[{"poster":"Chippys","date":"2016-03-04T08:29:03.821+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why do you never gank top lane are you some kind of moron?","replies":[{"poster":"CHF Spookz","date":"2016-03-04T09:22:29.493+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think morons play top lane therefore I shall not visit the lane.","replies":[{"poster":"SunCrusher","date":"2016-03-04T09:41:58.096+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should just call top lane the moron lane.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Frey√§","date":"2016-03-04T11:32:49.531+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Juves, as a diamond jungle main I feel like a I've been playing quite poorly as of late. I notice that I'm making lots of mistakes, more than I used to, but instead of finding a way to resolve it and improve my performance I keep drifting back into the same flawed playstyle. What do you use to remedy your off-streaks, and how have you improved your play in general to get to where you are now?","replies":[{"poster":"CHF Spookz","date":"2016-03-04T15:31:37.089+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey pal dont think about it to much. We all go through bad phases but beating yourself down about it  wont help anyone. Identify one thing you want to work on in solo queue whether its invading, efficient ganking or just dying less and try execute that. Rather then focusing on not playing bad you are focusing on a aspect of your game you can improve. This will also allow you to forget about LP and I think when you arnt worried about LP is when you start climbing. That basically is my remedy to improve play, if I start losing a few games I just think \"Ok Im losing because im careless and dying and not invading enough\" therefore I fix that and hopefully win? I hope this helped.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Geason","date":"2016-03-04T06:57:51.203+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey juves my mans, how long have you played league? and what champions did you use to gain elo?  love your stream bby","replies":[{"poster":"CHF Spookz","date":"2016-03-04T07:40:25.381+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey duuuuuuuuuuuuude, \nIve played league on and off for about 3 years now.

The hardest rank the climb through is always the one you arnt quite good enough to make yet. So if your gold 1 making platinum would be the hardest, if your diamond 5 making diamond 1 would be the hardest. its all relevant to your actual division. I get really nervous but I just visualize someone I idolize and how they deal with pressure and it kind of calms me down.

In traditional sport if someone plays poorly or could of done something better you tell them. In league I feel like sometimes people sugar coat things to not hurt the feelings of there team mates, but as an example over time rymeister and myself have built up an open and honest relationship where if he makes mistakes Ill let him know, works both ways. I think this improves team dynamic if everyone understand its for the good of the team and its never a personal attack.\n\nAnother key thing I feel is just being genuinely good friends with your teammates because to become successful you need to trust one another.
