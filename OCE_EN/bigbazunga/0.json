I understand that you have set your own standards for your product and community, but regardless this is still a form of discrimination. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, while disconnections are very frustrating at times, I personally feel that if it isn't in a ranked match, that an inconvenience in a videogame is hardly something worth complaining about to the point where you marginalise a section of the players. \r\n\r\nI hope this is not seen as aggressive or accusatory, I just felt a bit strange about the new situation while reading through the changes to the system and the FAQ section. \r\n\r\nThank you","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-18T22:43:10.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">However, this is to some degree financial discrimination\n\nYou talk like this is a new thing.\n\n> who cannot afford to upgrade their computer or their connection.\n\nThis ventures into the realm of why you originally got the computer. It's kinda silly to say, get a computer for work and school purposes (that is, without a graphics card) but still expect it to run games perfectly fine.\n\nI do agree that Leavebuster is exceptionally harsh, but based on the rate that people actually do purposefully leave games, I think we couldn't have it any lesser.\n\nFor future reference, rants belong in the Misc boards. This board is specifically to help others with running the game. Are you currently having issues with *your* game?","replies":[]}]}
