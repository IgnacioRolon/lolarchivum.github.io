ARGH.\nAnd this ult of hers, omfg..... There goes survivability in group fights... Instead of surviving and being included in the team fight, lets just do one attack AND THEN LEAVE EVERYONE TO DIE\nDon't even bring up the hate spike animation and skill shot, which stops you firing it off while running for your life....\nAnd instead of a speed up, we get a horrible crap slow? That even shows where we are? the fact you make it only shows to one person doesn't matter, everyone talks on discord, the moment you show us to one person, THEY  WILL ALL KNOW WHERE WE ARE...

If you wait just a little bit, you get some decent hard CC plus tonnes of bonus damage, not to mention W has a HUGE cast range. Imagine the mind games you can do: W an enemy when taking a nearby camp, but don't do anything. They'll probably run away even though you won't be a threat. \n\nUsing her charm is a mechanic we will have to get used to for pre-6 ganks. \n\nAlso, you can use Hate Spike while running away... You don't even actually have to land the skillshot in order to use the spikes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-09-27T20:50:11.155+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're seeing this from the wrong perspective I think. You're looking at it and still thinking about how these changes will affect current Eve, they wont!\nThis isn't a change to Evelynn, its a completely new champ with her name on it.\n\nNew abilities, new scalings, new base stats, new growth stats, new playstyle. Everything.\nEve is gone now, this is a new champion who just happens to be called Evelynn and have an invisible mechanic.\n\nThe same way that Yorick and Poppy are new champions, and the old ones were removed.\n\nYou can't look at these changes in the context of old Eve, new Eve is a completely new champ, any baggage that old Eve had, does not apply to new Eve.\n\nHer strong early game and need for kills early in order to survive late, are things that old Eve has. The new eve might play completely differently.\nShe might have a brutal late game, who knows yet.\n\nI can sympathise with the opposition to change, Riot recently butchered my main champ!\nIm not saying you can't mourn old Eve, nor am I saying that you should like new Eve, feel free to hate her and Riot if you want, I'm just saying that you have to view new Eve as hew own seperate champion, and not look at her in the context of old eve.  She isn't supposed to be exactly like old eve. \n\nMake your decisions of how good it is. not on how it'll affect old eve, but how you'll enjoy playing new eve.","replies":[{"poster":"Va1ium","date":"2017-09-28T16:20:35.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds reasonable... still sucks haha","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-09-28T00:36:30.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man I never thought \"Champion Update\" meant lets scrap this old champion and make a completely new one with the same name.","replies":[{"poster":"3Bies","date":"2017-09-28T05:07:09.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It means eve mark 1 is dead in the hopes of eve mark 2 being better.......
