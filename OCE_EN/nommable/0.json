I&#039;m using a cheap knock-off phone with very little (like a few hundred MB) of internal storage so every time I&#039;d like to install something I have to clear data or caches of other apps or downright uninstall stuff. I guess I could be a tester for low disk space situations for this application, just pulling the silver lining. :)\r\nIf I remember correctly it&#039;s along the lines of\r\nandroid:installLocation=&quot;auto&quot;\r\nadded to the manifest tag behind the android version number. Auto allows moving back and forth between SD card and internal storage as the user pleases and leaving out this line will lock it to the internal storage... which makes cheapskates like me sad :(\r\nBut that&#039;s just a suggestion from me and there&#039;s probably bigger things to worry about for you guys, and implementing the SD card functionality might break a ton of stuff which I never knew existed.\r\n\r\nAlso when I open the app, I get a pop up titled &quot;Update Google Play services&quot; with text &quot;LoL Friends won&#039;t run unless you update Google Play services.&quot; with a single button labelled &quot;UPDATE&quot;. Clicking the update button brings me to the Play store where I&#039;m presented with the Google Play services screen and an &quot;Update&quot; button. However, since I have a tiny amount of disk space left (or rather, for some reason every app and its dog requires at three times as much disk space as it really needs to be persuaded to be downloaded and installed) the update for Google Play services downloads and doesn&#039;t install citing insufficient disk space (just like everything I try to do with this phone).\r\nHowever, I can just tap out of the pop up in the LoL Friends Beta app (the pop up saying the app won&#039;t run unless Google Play services is updated) and the app seems to run fine.","replies":[]}
