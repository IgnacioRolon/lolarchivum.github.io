TRIBUNAL SYSTEM?","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dear Riot,\n\nI just read another discussion here: http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/LvGdc0hr-tribunal-please  - who mentioned a need for a tribunal system. But that was 2 years ago. Two years later, and despite some changes to the reporting and tribunal system, where is it really?\n\nJust came back from a nasty ranked game. My adc seemed quite new to ranked and though was quite mixed up with builds, the whole team hammered us when I defended her (I was supp). Saying things like &quot;This botline, can&#039;t do S!@#&quot;, &quot;probably clicked ranked by accident&quot;, and calling us &quot;stupid&quot; and telling us to &quot;f!@# up&quot;. Not even that, we were dying and in a team fight and they literally stood still behind us doing nothing! As if watching us die and not to add, they were &quot;laughing&quot;. Intentionally feeding one after another then blaming us for us losing?. There was worse that I don&#039;t want to remember. Like seriously, people can have a bad game and that&#039;s understandable because everyone has that. But, not only language and commenting, but behaviour like 6-year olds was unnecessary. This toxic and salty behaviour can be so negatively impacting on one&#039;s mental state of mind not just throughout the game, but after the game as well. Like in the discussion stated, the toxic spreads and breeds more toxic people.\n\nI ended up trying too add those 3 toxic people with only one accepting. I tried to explain how unnecessary such talk and language. He seemed to understand but eventually replied, &quot;But I wasn&#039;t even as savage as the teemo or vicktor&quot;. Got me wondering if they even know that such language is cruel and rude.\n\nRiot, I believe you should focus and put in more towards developing and strengthening the Tribunal system. So many school kids play these games nowadays and it really affects their behaviour in and away from the game as human beings. Players and innocent players are getting hammered day by day, and with more feedback and warnings, it can really make a difference.\n\nUGH I am so frustrated and it infuriates me just thinking about how salty and toxic this community is becoming day and day!\n\n**Please hear us out Riot!**","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2016-11-22T16:08:22.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's other systems in place. They work okay-ish. Fact of the matter, though, is that people don't report because they THINK the systems don't work. At this point, the system fails. Riot's biggest failure on this issue is that they aren't transparent enough. If people knew their report counted, player reports would be more accurate (i.e. selecting what they're reporting someone for), detailed and frequent. They'd also be more meaningful in that they'd report people they know deserve to get punished and will likely get punished; they wouldn't just report someone out of spite.","replies":[]}]}
