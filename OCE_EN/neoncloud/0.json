PLEASE make this a function where we can remove it, there are some players like myself, not many but some, i've had almost 9 accounts banned, because of my own personal problems. I MUTE EVERYONE AND MOVE THE CHAT BOX OFF my screen, but it never removes the temptation, no sorry the COMPULSION. I sit on the Autism spectrum and it sparks outburst of anger, where i even though they may not respond or even say anything, i will uncontrollably hit the enter key and start flaming away, even if i cannot see what im saying or what they respond. its Just how some people like myself, our brains work. We need an option to remove chat from the settings in pregame client so when we load in we cant start flaming away or deactivate it. Its not fair to have some of us like myself here losing our hard work and effort just because our brains function differently.","replies":[]}]}
