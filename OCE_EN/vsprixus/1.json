High golds get matched with low silvers, people massively feed persons who out skill them so much they never stood a chance. This just makes the game suck for everyone. I&#039;v had many games that have just felt like empty wins the opponents are so bad. I&#039;v also been schooled by players far better than myself.\r\n\r\nAll i can think this comes down to, is that the queue times are too &quot;rushed&quot; and they will match people on different skills farm too quickly. just wait like 2 more min and have a much more balanced fun game than sitting though 20 minutes of facepalmary and noob calling.\r\n\r\nTake longer picking teams, get better ranked games.","replies":[{"poster":"Fruitsalad","date":"2015-04-25T14:34:43.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its called boosting and duo Q\n\nRITO OCE do care, but they cant do jack shit.\n\nthey have ZERO Control\n\nall control is in NA!\n\n\nonly shit they can do is forum bans. and even that's doubtful\n","replies":[]}]}
