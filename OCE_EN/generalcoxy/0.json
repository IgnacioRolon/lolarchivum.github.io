To obtain permission to paint the mural on the sea wall you have to go through local council approval. Each year many artists compete to paint a section of the sea wall and unfortunately we did not gain approval. It&#039;s a blow as its an awesome location but this is not the end of the 2016 Ocean Week wall.\n\nCaspian De Looze, who is a famous tattoo/artist from Sydney, has worked with the winners of last years art competition and has completed the mural and is poised and ready to paint our next chosen location.\n\n**So what are the next steps? **\n\nWe are working to find a new location so that we can have the mural painted as soon as possible so we can celebrate all the players that took part in Ocean Week 2016. We will keep you posted and let you all know when we have secured our location.\n\nIf you have any questions throw them in the comments below and I will do my best to answer them all.\n\nThanks\nGeneralCoxy","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-01-13T09:05:18.119+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Don't just look at the rich areas! There's plenty of space along the inner west train line near St Peters where graffiti artists have their say.... perhaps reserve a spot there :) Or in Redfern :) Failing that, contact Parramatta City Council, they are a good bunch of blokes who should be able to sort something out.","replies":[{"poster":"GeneralCoxy","date":"2017-01-14T21:50:10.813+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great point - we are looking at loads of locations at the moment.

As for names \"there will be plaque containing all the player names that reached the required number of points.\"\n\nHere's a better explanation from the official page:\n\n>Congratulations to grand prize winner Joelin 'Fainaru' T. for her beautiful piece of art 'Defenders of Oceania'! Joelin will be collaborating with a prolific street artist to create a wall mural at a cool location somewhere in Oceania. It'll be part of a community wall that features the names of all summoners that contributed 10 or more points during Ocean Week. The name of the street artist and the location of the wall will be announced at a later date.\n\n>Here's a link: http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/community/community-spotlight/announcing-ocean-week-contest-winners","replies":[]}]}]}
