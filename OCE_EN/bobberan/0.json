I cannot seem to access the Friends/Clubs/Notifications tabs and it just in general looks completely different. The edge of the client seems to have runes around it and the tabs at the bottom left are flashing frequently but cannot be opened.\r\n\r\nAlso I cant seem to upload a picture or do a link because its a sinppit of what I saw on my screen. I hope this description is enough.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-07-27T06:53:22.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nSounds to me like your client has reverted to the old look, this can be resolved by [running a client repair](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#wq6).","replies":[{"poster":"Bobberan","date":"2016-07-27T10:15:01.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay I'll try that, thank you for the suggestion.
