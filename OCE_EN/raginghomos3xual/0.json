Thank you for your consideration.\n( I am kind of glad I learnt philosophy in school despite sleeping in some of the classes.)\nFeedback would be appreciated:D\n\n--------------------------------\n\n\nParadigm Shift.\n(Alternate title: Ontological Paradigm)\n\nIn ontological philosophy, they say god must have &quot;greatness&quot; to be the essential part of the creation of worlds. They say that if there are possibilities of parallel worlds, then god must be in all of them because he must be great, therefore that universe is more perfect. However, contrary to the belief there are also worlds with no God. So how can it not be impeccable too, death is beauty and is perfection, nothing can be ever so &quot;great&quot;.\nWe are the ones who create this beauty. They say in parallel worlds, there must be at least one world where there would be undeniable evidence of god&#039;s existence. \n\nIn this world, we are god.\n{{summoner:14}} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scarlet night scattered eerie shadows across all structures in the red moonlight. Howling winds travelled through the barren streets and through the willow trees, as if attempting to find a single living thing in its path, but to no avail. \nThe Blood Moon loomed over the town, the residents cowering in their homes, embracing loved ones and not making the slightest sound as black shadows danced across the roofs while some slid across walls in an inhuman manner. On the far side of the town stood an isolated temple entrance, with no temple, the red structure sat eerily on top of the hill, a lone lantern positioned in the centre, slightly glowing with the colour of blood. \nA figure appeared on the hill, a young girl adorning tattered clothes and a rag cloak. She ran as the shadows chased her from all four sides, her bare feet slamming against the soft grass surrounding the area. Fearing for her life, she ran to the glowing light, unknown to her what would come next. When she had reached the structure, the shadows immediately retreated as they slid away and went into the darkness of the night. The young girl breathed a sigh of relief as she never took her eyes off the fleeing shadows, until they had been completely out of vision. Confused, she looked back at the strange lantern, intrigued by the design and the radiating red light throbbing in the centre. As she was completely immersed into the object, a cold and bony hand slowly wrapped around the girl&#039;s neck. She immediately spun around to see an inhuman silhouette in front of her, due to the lack of light there was hardly anything clear to be seen. The only thing visible was the outline of a half spider/half human monster, their claws reflecting the light of the lantern, ready to pounce on the victim.\nThe terrified girl backed away, subsequently knocking the lantern to the ground, she ran as fast as her legs could carry her. Never looking back she prepared to dash down the hill when she suddenly heard a soft and creepy cackle behind her, followed by the sound of chains. As she turned around, she saw a blood stained hook flying towards her, followed by the sound of blood splattering onto the grass.\nThe figures on the hill emerged into the moon&#039;s light, revealing their masks, red attire and ghastly glowing eyes. &quot;How unfortunate, no remains for my web,&quot; Elise said as Thresh swung his hook back to his side, his lantern gleamed with red in the night, faint howls and screams could be heard in the spectral object. &quot;What a fool to be travelling out in the night of the Blood Moon,&quot; his haunting voice responded. &quot;I suspected that we might have frightened her a little extreme,&quot; she said as she brushed over her golden claws with interest.\n&quot;Nothing is too extreme with the beauty of death,&quot; a deep, graceful but deathlike voice suddenly said.\n\n&quot;Do you ought to say that every time?&quot; A younger, husky voice with an echoey tone said in response. Both stepped out to show them selves.\n&quot;Yasuo and Jhin, what a surprise to see you both here,&quot; Thresh said. \n\n&quot;I sensed blood and immediately had my presence here,&quot; Jhin commented while striding forwards.\n\n&quot;Always trying to get into the centre stage?&quot; Yasuo said with slight bitterness.\n\n&quot;Death is the centre of the play and I am the writer,&quot;\n\n&quot;You ought to your ego at hand, gunner,&quot; \n\nThe two readied their weapons, ghastly eyes behind masks locked onto each other. The sound of gunshots and metal echoed into the air, the commencement of the fight had come. Yasuo effortlessly dodged the bullets as he jumped side to side, while navigating himself on the roof. Jhin followed and jumped onto a nearby lamp post, aiming his gun at the sword wielding samurai. Both ran upon roof tops as they threw attacks at each other. \nThresh and Elise observed close by and stayed stagnant, this was not a rare occurrence.\nSparks erupted from the deflection of bullets, a few grenades barely scraped past Yasuo as he cut them down and backed away to avoid explosions. \t\nJhin cackled as he mindlessly shot in every direction, as some bullets harmlessly bounced off the samurais wind wall. Yasuo took the chance and ran towards him, sword steady in one hand as he struck down, the katana making contact with the metal gun, a huge &quot;CLANG&quot; rang outwards into the night. Immediately, a trap erupted under the two, as Yasuo jumped back on instinct before the contraption could explode in his face, he was suddenly snared in place, a purple line under him prevented him from movement. \n&quot;Places every one, places!&quot;\nHe heard the inevitable sound of a familiar and faint music, before he knew it, a huge bullet flew past his mask, grazing it and leaving a spark behind. Three more followed, Yasuo immediately brandished his wind wall, barely deflecting the bullets in time. As he was finally freed of his snared movement, winds picked up around him as he charged up his blade, conjuring a tornado into Jhin&#039;s direction. Jhin swiftly dodged the flash like attack and reloaded his bullets, commencing his next action once again. The rivals stood a distance from each other, readied themselves, and forged ahead, attacks flying in all directions, causing a disturbance around the area as dirt and leaves flew into the air. When everything cleared the two were at each other&#039;s throats; Jhin&#039;s pistol was pointed at Yasuo&#039;s head while Yasuo&#039;s sword was at Jhins neck.\n\n&quot;Stop this foolishness,&quot; an intimidating voice said.\n\nJhin and Yasuo stopped in their tracks and turned to see none other than the blood priestess herself, her crescent blade in hand, glinting with red at the sharpness of her weapon. Behind her were the Blade Assassin, Talon and the Spell Conjurer, Twisted fate, with his apparition like cards in his hands.\n\n&quot;We do not fight one another, we only kill the foolish.&quot; She said as her phantasmal eyes glinted behind her eerie mask. The gunner and the samurai retracted their weapons reluctantly as Jhin responded, &quot; Apologies, priestess, we were only sparring,&quot;, while Yasuo looked away and did not comment further, his hand still gripped on his katana.\n\n&quot;Leave the irrelevance for later, we must commence our duty, the night is still young,&quot; Diana said as she looked towards Twisted Fate, he nodded in acknowledgement and turned towards the red temple entrance, conjuring his cards, the middle suddenly lit up in purple as a portal. The winds were being sucked in, as if to invite the members into it eagerly. \n&quot;The others are waiting on the other side,&quot; Twisted Fate said as the members stood in front of the entrance, ready to enter.\nDiana turned around and brandished her weapon, looking into the portal. \n\n&quot;We who control the fates of the people, we allow them to live or allow them to die, we control their fear and we control their lives, let us begin the hunt.&quot; She recited in a ghastly tone as they stepped into the howling gateway, disappearing into the scarlet night, under the red moon.\n\n\"In this world, we are the gods,\"\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"ZVCKK","date":"2017-03-12T05:27:32.269+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice, very deep at the end.","replies":[{"poster":"RAgingHomoS3xual","date":"2017-03-12T06:09:27.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much for the feedback :)!","replies":[]}]}]}
