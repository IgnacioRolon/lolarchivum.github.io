Notes are below abilities. If anyone is willing I'd also like some help with Base Stats as I'm having trouble working them out.

I wanted something slightly complex, so it makes you keep track of the enemy’s damage, and to use abilities in opportune moments (think Ahri Q and Vayne W, it’s all timing for that stun).\r\n\r\nQ – I designed this ability last, around all the others. I changed it from an AoE root, from a double cast stat reduction, but since he already has those kind of abilities I tried to make it a bit different. It’s certainly the weakest ability from a design standpoint, so I welcome any feedback on it especially.\r\n\r\nW – As a support Leon should be interacting with his AD carry, so he can give out extra AD for a short time. The cooldown is long so as to mitigate spamming, and to make you think about when to use it in teamfights. It also gives AP as long as that’s the bigger stat, so mages will like him too. Leon cannot self-cast this ability either.\r\n\r\nE – The first ability that I thought of, in tandem with his R. Thematically it makes sense, adding up the defences of his enemies then exploiting them. I decided to make it deal true damage in exchange for not scaling (with any of Leon’s stats anyway, it scales with his enemies!)\r\n\r\nR – A brainchild that I have held for some time was to downsize an enemy’s stats and block off the benefit of items for a short time. I originally thought of this as a basic ability, but the consequences hit me in waves – denial of all those bonus stats is pretty awful, especially since it also locks out actives and passives, like Zhonya’s Hourglass and Guardian Angel. It may be quite overpowered, but it is also why this champ is here, and the long cooldown hopefully mitigates some of that. Again, if you think its unbalanced, feedback on why etc. would be most welcome.","replies":[{"poster":"Ryz","date":"2015-01-26T07:02:44.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"does q scale of anything? i can see the q as a easy poke but it will take a lot of time to dish out a lot of dmg, overall i this champ seems solid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Faruel","date":"2015-01-18T12:19:51.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i really like the overall concept though to slightly diminish the \"R\" i would have it so they have the stat reduction as a percentage as to allow for rank progression and item activation would still work allowing someone to zhonya's as to prevent being stomped, with health items it could cripple some tanks very hard","replies":[]}]}
