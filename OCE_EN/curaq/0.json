{"poster":"Curaq","date":"2014-12-26T07:42:02.842+0000","title":"Poppy gameplay update(proposition).","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Poppy** *the Iron Ambassador*\n**Primary Role:** Fighter\n**Secondary Role: **Tank\n\n**Passive - Valiant Fighter**: Poppy takes ((level x multiplier) + flat) less damage from abilities (and/or attacks). (After armor and resist)\n\n**Q - Devastating Blow**: Unchanged\n\n\n**W - First Cast: Hammer Throw**: Poppy throws her hammer a fixed distance in a straight line (900 units) stopping at the first enemy unit hit slowing for (flat)(+AP)% and dealing (flat)(+AP) magic damage. While on the ground the hammer gives vision and slows in a small area (radius: approx 200). Poppy cannot cast Q without her hammer. If Poppy walks within 200 units of her hammer she picks it up and gains a speed boost.\n\n**W - Second Cast: Reunite**: Poppy's hammer flies back to her hand.\n\n\n**E - Heroic Charge**: Armor scaling instead of AP scaling.\n\n\n**R - Whomping Time**:\n**Passive: ** Poppy gains 1/2/3 armor and damage for given and received attacks stacking 10 times.\n\n**Active:** Poppy leaps to her hammer and deals (flat)(+AP) damage to (small radius). She gains attack speed, max stacks and health regen.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Reasons for change**\n**Passive:** Poppy's current passive (and ult) encourages her to only build offensively. The more defensive stats you have the less useful it is. This new passive still allows poppy to build offensively but also encourages her greatly for building tank. This poppy kit would steer her more to being a bruiser/fighter/brawler which is where I think poppy's identity should lie. Receiving less damage from auto attacks could seriously defeat bruisers though\n\n**W - Paragon of Demacia**: I don't think a melee champion can survive without semi-reliable cc. Poppy's E is possibly the most unreliable cc in the game and can be escaped in many ways. The ability to zone with a slow is extremely useful for allowing poppy to initiate so she doesn't have to rely on her ult. The speed is also useful for initiating but you can also get zoned from your hammer and then have to use mana to pick it up and get no speed boost.\n\n**E - Heroic Charge:** If this wasn't changed, everything in poppy's kit would scale with AP. Scaling with armor allows poppy to build tank and focus on cc to deal damage.\n\n**R - Whomping Time:** Poppy's current ult is so op that the rest of her kit and her base stats are gutted because of it. Getting rid of the ult allows poppy to better survive the laning phase and not simply sit around and wait for ult to be up. The most powerful ability in poppy's kit is now movement. Because it allows her to reposition for E or to get in your grill. Max passive stacks on ult is simply a QoL feature, attack speed is to help the fighter poppy without helping the tank poppy, and health regen is to help the tank poppy without helping the fighter poppy (to much).\n\nIt only made sense for this to be scaled with AP. As a fighter/tank you would only be using it to reposition and not assassinate. Also making it AP gives AP poppy a pretty clear play style as the only assassin variant of Poppy.\n\n**AD Bruiser Play Style**\nIn lane you trade with your q still, but now you have the option of also zoning your opponent if your jungler ganks and aren't forced to try and position yourself awkwardly to use your E to cc which is unreliable at best. Being able to zone a slow gives you very small power in a 1v1 scenario but it allows poppy to be a team player more and when you get your ult the zoning power increases greatly.\n\nBuilding Tri-force will definitely be still the way to go with your low CD q unchanged. Though now you have more options to keep the fight going if your opponent runs away.\n\n**AP Assassin Play Style**\nThe AP play style would be pretty boring until you get to use your ult. Probably something like E through a minion to Q then W in melee range for insta-pickup + speed boost away. Then when they get low enough E through to Q then back off to cast your W so you don't pick your hammer up before casting R. Yes, you can't cast your R unless your hammer is on the ground. Having E not scaling with AP means less abilities to worry about and simpler spell priorities.\n\nBuilding high AP probably would be the way to go. Crappy ratios to force so poppy wont be an AP bruiser.\n\n**Tank Initiator Play Style**\nSupport tank with small amount of AP for those damages. Relying completely on the passive scaling extremely well with armor and magic resist. Forcing any sort of tank-poppy to go all the way. Zone slow with w more easily as you aren't so reliant on your q for duo trades. \n\nI know Poppy's game play update is coming up soon so I thought I'd propose my own idea's for her kit. I used to play Poppy a truckload and she was the first champion I got a Pentakill on. Also, please put the visor down on Blacksmith Poppy's skin, it would look a lot cooler if it was on her face instead of her forehead.","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-12-26T07:53:27.260+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are they changing Poppy?","replies":[{"poster":"Curaq","date":"2014-12-26T07:57:04.274+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the list of the next few champs.\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202294884-Champion-Update-Schedule","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-12-26T08:14:11.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Curaq,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=nfxNdfPc,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2014-12-26T07:57:04.274+0000)\n>\n> This is the list of the next few champs.\n> https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202294884-Champion-Update-Schedule\n\nOh for %%%% sake Riot.

Archaic design with unrelaible damage/cc. She completely relies on her ult to do anything and its so op that it gimps the rest of her kit.
