But I&#039;m done, absolutely done with this. \r\n\r\nWhat&#039;s with these false promises in the loading screen like &quot;You can report players with unwanted behavior after the match&quot; and &quot;The Tribunal has punished and reformed x-thousand player&quot; etc etc. Does the report system even work?\r\n\r\nEver since I started playing (which is like, a few years ago, though I only started taking the game seriously this January so that will be the reference point here), I cannot go for 5 matches straight without having someone that instalocks, takes a role that someone else already called, some that calls you a retard even though he&#039;s an adc that&#039;s like 1/9 in lane as miss fortune. At first I sorta tolerated it, I didn&#039;t let it get into my head and tried to not tilt for the match and just report them afterwards.\r\n\r\nBut pretty recently there are just a really high amount of toxicity in the community.\r\n\r\nJust last night I got flamed by a Jinx because he died when the enemy midlaner roamed to bot and killed him, even though I pinged the he was missing. He even called me a retard for not following a roaming midlaner. Then mid-March I had a Blitzcrank call support in champ select but went toplane, and our Illaoi started feeding because he didn&#039;t want to share his lane.\r\n\r\nBut to be honest, they&#039;re not even the worst kinds of players here.\r\n\r\n(Warning, judging from the type of people that exists in the internet nowadays that get offended with every singe thing in existence, the next part might be offensive so proceed with caution)\r\n\r\nThe absolute worst kind of players are the Chinese players I tend to get queued up. Now I have nothing against China, or its people, just the Chinese toxic lol players. Not trying to be racist or anything.\r\n\r\nNot only do they do all the things I&#039;ve stated above but the fact that they don&#039;t speak English already makes them terrible.\r\n\r\nI got queued with a master yi just a few minutes ago and I got so annoyed that I just had to make this post here. He calls us an idiot, even though he didn&#039;t call a role in champ select and chose smite even though we had a lee sin jungle. And spent the entire match roaming around getting killed and ksing us during clashes and spam the chat with Chinese letters and the devil&#039;s number. He even went in the match with no masteries. And just a few weeks ago I got queued with a Draven who didn&#039;t really spam chat or anything but he intentionally fed and type :D every time he dies, which is a lot. i don&#039;t want to state specific names but if I have to, I have them all on my block list.\r\n\r\nAnd in all seriousness why are these players even here? Now I admit I live in Asia myself I&#039;m like right above Australia. But I acted like one who belongs here, I communicated in English because I speak it well (this is sorta out of topic here but a few days ago I was playing Lux and typed in chat &quot;I should&#039;ve rushed zhonya&#039;s&quot; then someone corrected me &quot;it&#039;s should of not should&#039;ve&quot;, come on guys.. srsly) And these sort of players not only ruin the game but ruin the image of the people they represent, kinda like what happened on my view of them. I&#039;m really annoyed earlier since I&#039;m on sort of a IP hoard since I&#039;m trying to buy champions (ehem, {{champion:92}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:91}} ) that&#039;s why I&#039;m hoping someone in the higher ups would do something about this.\r\n\r\nAnd before you comment something like &quot;stop whining it&#039;s just solo q norms&quot; well that would be a valid statement, although I even get this experience in ranked, I even played bots to try out a new champion and I still encounter these.\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of bots have you guys experienced playing bots and you get queued with names like 072 Robert or something like that, like what are those things? Even in norms there are bots that go all mid with no masteries and using only rotation champions. I assume they&#039;re from the websites that sell level 30 accounts or something idk. Luckily they&#039;re always on the enemy team. I would enjoy playing against them but the people I get queued with wants to end the match quickly because they have &quot;pride&quot; and want to get better playing a real game rather than get boosted by an intentionally thrown match, like seriously.... \r\n\r\nSo that concludes it pretty much, really wish reporting actually does something in this game, at least make it something like, we won&#039;t get queued with someone if we report them or something along those lines. Or maybe it already does and I just haven&#039;t noticed it.","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-04-14T06:11:01.386+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When someone fails to call for a role and someone auto locks and arguments start, you're better off dodging the game","replies":[{"poster":"SoftHardcore11","date":"2016-04-14T14:12:00.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, But I can only do that for a few times until that bullshit system bans me for dodging too many matches, they need to remove it seriously","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-04-13T05:00:42.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are comfortable that you are doing your job just mute and move on.

If you're sitting top while the enemy pushes to your inhibs then that's a red flag to me. You're abandoning you team to odds they clearly couldn't win against, when you could at least use your ult to lock down a carry.\n\nInhibs > First tier turrets. You should have been with your team, not sitting top lane lamenting at how bad they are. Maybe the Braum was playing badly, but you weren't playing at all.\n\n> I don't play hard carries, I play for a team role\n\nAnd yet you do not seem to play with the team. A team role is useless if you don't use it, it's more useless than an underfed carry because at least they can still do a little. Sitting top in a 'team role' while YOU, not 'your team' YOU in the plural sense lose inhibs does nothing for the game, and only gets you further away from their nexus.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-04-14T05:26:45.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ADC had seven kills in 11 minutes and a tower, I was still top lane defending my lane, WTF am I supposed to do?

People not taking keystones or masteries, intent feeding, using retarded builds like an AP adc... it just goes on.

Also, keep in mind that this sort of thing happens a lot more frequently in normal Q than in ranked, since most people who play normals don't really care about this sort of thing and are just there to have some casual fun. My advice? If someone instalocks a role that you wanted, just pick a different role. If someone's being toxic or trash talking, just mute them and move on. Remember, its just a game, an online game to be exact, which means there's all types of different people within the community including both toxic players as well as pleasant, team players.
