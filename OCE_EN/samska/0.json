I'm looking for someone to duo with whilst simultaneously (that's a big word to make me look smart) having a laugh, climbing the ladder and making scrubs question their life choices.\r\n\r\nBefore applying, here are a few things you MUST fulfill:\r\n\r\n - Be Silver 5 or higher.\r\n\r\n - Be willing to have a laugh, and stay positive even when were losing.\r\n\r\n- Have an Englishmens affinity for tea and biscuits. {{item:2010}} \r\n\r\n- Be able to cop criticism, and also give some out. If we're in silver, we definitely need it.\r\n\r\n- Be MATURE, but not too boring. Don't go raging at people like a twelvie.\r\n\r\n[Some form of voice chat, Skype, TeamSpeak, Curse Voice etc is required.]\r\n\r\nSince we'll potentially be duoing a lot together, it would be preferable to get to know each other. The following is a list of activities that would be desirable:\r\n\r\n- Watching eSports together! (LCS, IEM etc, tbh whatever is on)\r\n\r\n- Constructive and intellectual conversations about tea's.\r\n\r\n- Playing the odd twisted treeline or ARAM for laughs.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in becoming apart of my life (league circlejerk) either leave a brief summary about yourself below, or contact me on the following:\r\n\r\nSkype:  **hooliagn370** (Judge my gameplay, not my spelling)\r\nLeague:  **Samska**\r\nCurse: **Hooligan370** (Again, an old username, don't judge me)\r\n\r\nLook forward to hearing from you, and good luck on the Fields of Justice!\r\n\r\n-Samska","replies":[{"poster":"Samska","date":"2015-01-01T12:52:57.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump?","replies":[]},{"poster":"StellarUmbra","date":"2014-12-28T23:10:07.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo mama is so proud of u. if only you can use half the effort that you put in to writing this in your school work and getting a LIFE.","replies":[{"poster":"StellarUmbra","date":"2014-12-28T23:11:04.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"jk\n#nogamenolife","replies":[{"poster":"Samska","date":"2014-12-30T01:23:10.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's times like these that make me question our friendship.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
