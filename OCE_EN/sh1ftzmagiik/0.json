It is very confusing and difficult to explain but I will try anyway. When I try to play a game of League of Legends, any mode (urf, twisted treeline, normal, ranked, custom, tournament code), I get a freeze about 3 seconds into the loading screen, from that point onwards no further frames are displayed but sound continues, once the loading screen is complete, I hear the map music and everyone drop into the fountain etc. but I do not see any of this, I only see that frozen frame of the loading screen. The game never crashes or bugsplats, when I close it in task manager and reconnect I am faced with the same issue.\n\nThis is where it gets weirder, when I press alt-enter to go into windowed mode the frame updates in that split second of adjustment. From there I now see only that individual frame and sound continues, I can keep pressing alt-enter to update the frame but it still doesn&#039;t do anything to help me. I was not experiencing this issue at at any time or ever previous to this patch and am very confused why this occurs.\n\nAdditionally when this first happened to me in my first URF game on the update, I tried restarting my computer, this fixed the issue for the remainder of the game when I press reconnect but when I then try to play another game the same issue happens.\n \nI have tried: reinstalling game, verifying game files (repair) , updating my drivers, re-installing my drivers, updating DirectX, re-installing DirectX, restarting my computer (which fixes it for the remainder of the game I start), running the game in a compatibility mode (e.g. Windows Service Pack, Windows 7 etc.).\n\nI have tried running every other game in my steam library (all 83) and none of them are effected except Witcher 2 which interestingly had the same problem but I haven&#039;t played that game in months and I have auto-updates for Witcher 2 disabled.\n\nPlease help me I was really excited to play URF and am now unable to play League at all.\n\nSpecs:\nHardware\nIntel i7 6700K\nAMD R9 390 (MSI version)\nGigabyte Z170-HD3\nCorsair LPX 2133Mhz 16GB DDR4 Memory\nSoftware\nWindows 10\nDirectX 9.0,9.2,9.3,10.0,10.1,11.0,11.1,12.0\nAMD Driver 16.150.2211.0\nGigabyte BIOS Version F5\n\nEDIT: I managed to fix this issue, I am not 100% sure what did it, but on the attempt that finally worked, I edited my game.cfg to display the game in a 640*480 windowed mode and compatibility mode (Windows 7). I was then able to keep playing in fullscreen when I pressed alt-enter and haven't had any problems since.","replies":[{"poster":"Metalrace","date":"2016-05-23T01:12:38.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For those having this issue and have NZXT CAM (v.3.0.6) running in the background, completely quite the app and try league again.
