Obviously he has quite questionable CC with his E being a slightly delayed stun, also he has no shields or heals in his kit prior to building items. With Face of the Mountain, Zeke&#039;s Harbinger, Banner of Command and Zhonya&#039;s/Banshee&#039;s Veil/Warmogs/Rylai&#039;s/Rod of Ages/Randuins, Jax could have the FoTM shield, a large boost to health, armor and MR with a very sizable AP boost so he still deals damage, possibly even including some attack speed if his passive isn&#039;t cutting it. He also gains amazing utility from Banner of Command and the  arguably support oriented Zeke&#039;s Harbinger. So looking aside from Jax&#039;s low utility and small amount of cc, and taking in the utilities and extreme bulk due to his scaling defensive ult and items, I wonder if it could work.\r\nAny thoughts or opinions on possible items to use, or any flaws (there are many in this idea) would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2015-07-23T02:01:24.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIP old Zekes.","replies":[]}]}
