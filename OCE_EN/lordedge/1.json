Never seen anyone else play Jax like this in any of my games. Why?\r\nDevourer when sated doubles the on hit effects from Nashor&#039;s, gives his ult passive proc on every second auto and every attack in between will be a W with Nashor&#039;s CDR. So every single auto if done correctly will proc spell vamp and life-steal from Hextech which will be complimented by Spirit Visage. Trinity and BotRK are still amazing on him but building him mostly AP+AS-&gt;AD-&gt;Offtank Hyrbid with the sated devourer gives him ridiculous burst damage and sustain.","replies":[{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-08-21T13:18:17.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"try it in ranked and see how it goes","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-08-21T02:58:24.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being allowed to farm for 20 minutes by retards doesn't make something viable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-08-21T01:46:16.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol that looks strong and fun. probably wouldnt be viable in higher elo though. he'd be way too squishy throughout the game and jax and devourer jungling particularly is susceptible to falling off pretty hard to counterjungling, but gj with those games","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-08-21T01:20:39.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He gets MR for building AP and Armor for building AD when he hits ultimate so AP is great for versing mages, but botrk lets you fight tanks better and burst isn't usually as good verse them so it's probably better in mage filled games or when there are no tanks.","replies":[]}]}
