Can't install or uninstall LoL ? :(","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Months ago I've tried to remove LoL by deleting every file concerning it, but when i go to programs/features I am unable to uninstall League of Legends because I am missing a file called **\"LoL.NA.msi\"** (Ive always played on OCE). \r\n\r\nWhen I tried installing the game recently, it always came as a \"vcredist\" error, or an error to install since I have an older version of the game already. But I can't uninstall it? :(","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-12T01:07:01.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is not how you are meant to uninstall programs, because doing that will leave all entries in your registry regarding the program you deleted as still installed, which causes many bugs and glitches. Since you ultimately deleted what was there to clean the reg, you're going to have to do it manually, which is risky if you don't know what you're doing.\n\nFirstly, what OS are you using?","replies":[{"poster":"xkaay10","date":"2015-01-12T01:13:13.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, using my boyfriends laptop and they deleted it because he hates LoL since he plays DoTA.

It's quite complicated, though, and risky (as in, you can stop your computer running at all).  Before attempting this, create a system repair disc and (if possible) back up all of your data to another drive.\n\nAll the following instructions where text is in quotation marks are typed in without those marks. Eg. \"regedit.exe\" would be typed in as\n>regedit.exe\n\nOpen up regedit by pressing Winkey+R and typing in \"regedit.exe\". Click \"Ok\" to the prompt asking you to allow the program to edit files.\n\nClick \"File\", \"Export\" and save the file to somewhere easily accessible. This is a backup of your registry as it currently is; having it could easily fix some problems you run into.\n\nThe rest of the instructions are very lengthy, thus I'll wait to see if you're actually going through with this before continuing. I'll be back in about half an hour to see.","replies":[{"poster":"xkaay10","date":"2015-01-12T01:48:28.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh I see, it's not officially my laptop so I don't want to do anything to it that could be detrimental.
